The	economy	's	temperature	will	be	taken	*-1	from	several	vantage	points	this	week	,	with	readings	on	trade	,	output	,	housing	and	inflation	.
The	most	troublesome	report	may	be	the	August	merchandise	trade	deficit	due	out	tomorrow	.
The	trade	gap	is	expected	*-1	to	widen	to	about	$	9	billion	*U*	from	July	's	$	7.6	billion	*U*	,	according	to	a	survey	by	MMS	International	,	a	unit	of	McGraw-Hill	Inc.	,	New	York	.
Thursday	's	report	on	the	September	consumer	price	index	is	expected	*-1	to	rise	,	although	not	as	sharply	as	the	0.9	%	gain	reported	*	Friday	in	the	producer	price	index	.
That	gain	was	being	cited	*-1	as	a	reason	0	the	stock	market	was	down	early	in	Friday	's	session	,	before	it	got	*-2	started	*-2	on	its	reckless	190-point	plunge	*T*-3	.
Economists	are	divided	*-1	as	to	how	much	manufacturing	strength	they	expect	*-2	to	see	*T*-3	in	September	reports	on	industrial	production	and	capacity	utilization	,	also	due	tomorrow	.
Meanwhile	,	September	housing	starts	,	due	Wednesday	,	are	thought	*	to	have	inched	upward	.
``	There	's	a	possibility	of	a	surprise	''	in	the	trade	report	,	said	0	*T*-1	Michael	Englund	,	director	of	research	at	MMS	.
A	widening	of	the	deficit	,	if	it	were	combined	*-1	with	a	stubbornly	strong	dollar	,	would	exacerbate	trade	problems	--	but	the	dollar	weakened	Friday	as	stocks	plummeted	.
In	any	event	,	Mr.	Englund	and	many	others	say	that	the	easy	gains	in	*	narrowing	the	trade	gap	have	already	been	made	*-1	.
``	Trade	is	definitely	going	*-3	to	be	more	politically	sensitive	over	the	next	six	or	seven	months	as	improvement	begins	*-1	to	slow	,	''	he	said	*T*-2	.
Exports	are	thought	*-1	to	have	risen	strongly	in	August	,	but	probably	not	enough	*	to	offset	the	jump	in	imports	,	economists	said	*T*-2	.
Views	on	manufacturing	strength	are	split	between	economists	who	*T*-1	read	September	's	low	level	of	factory	job	growth	as	a	sign	of	a	slowdown	and	those	who	*T*-2	use	the	somewhat	more	comforting	total	employment	figures	in	their	calculations	.
The	wide	range	of	estimates	for	the	industrial	output	number	underscores	the	differences	:	The	forecasts	run	from	a	drop	of	0.5	%	to	an	increase	of	0.4	%	,	according	to	MMS	.
A	rebound	in	energy	prices	,	which	*T*-1	helped	push	up	the	producer	price	index	,	is	expected	*-2	to	do	the	same	in	the	consumer	price	report	.
The	consensus	view	expects	a	0.4	%	increase	in	the	September	CPI	after	a	flat	reading	in	August	.
Robert	H.	Chandross	,	an	economist	for	Lloyd	's	Bank	in	New	York	,	is	among	those	expecting	a	more	moderate	gain	in	the	CPI	than	in	prices	at	the	producer	level	.
``	Auto	prices	had	a	big	effect	in	the	PPI	,	and	at	the	CPI	level	they	wo	n't	*?*	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
Food	prices	are	expected	*-2	to	be	unchanged	,	but	energy	costs	jumped	as	much	as	4	%	,	said	0	*T*-1	Gary	Ciminero	,	economist	at	Fleet\/Norstar	Financial	Group	.
He	also	says	0	he	thinks	0	``	core	inflation	,	''	which	*T*-1	excludes	the	volatile	food	and	energy	prices	,	was	strong	last	month	.
He	expects	a	gain	of	as	much	as	0.5	%	in	core	inflation	after	a	summer	of	far	smaller	increases	.
Housing	starts	are	expected	*	to	quicken	a	bit	from	August	's	annual	pace	of	1,350,000	units	.
Economists	say	0	an	August	rebound	in	permits	for	multifamily	units	signaled	an	increase	in	September	starts	,	though	activity	remains	fairly	modest	by	historical	standards	.

*	Assuming	0	the	stock	market	does	n't	crash	again	and	completely	discredit	yuppies	and	trading	rooms	,	American	television	audiences	in	a	few	months	may	be	seeing	Britain	's	concept	of	both	.
``	Capital	City	''	is	a	weekly	series	that	*T*-1	premiered	here	three	weeks	ago	amid	unprecedented	hype	by	its	producer	,	Thames	Television	.
The	early	episodes	make	you	long	for	a	rerun	of	the	crash	of	1987	.
*	Let	's	make	that	1929	,	just	*	to	be	sure	.
According	to	the	program	's	publicity	prospectus	,	``	Capital	City	,	''	set	at	Shane	Longman	,	a	fictional	mid-sized	securities	firm	with	#	500	million	*U*	capital	,	``	follows	the	fortunes	of	a	close-knit	team	of	young	,	high-flying	dealers	,	hired	*	for	their	particular	blend	of	style	,	genius	and	energy	.
But	with	all	the	money	and	glamour	of	high	finance	come	*T*-1	the	relentless	pressures	*	to	do	well	;	pressure	*	to	pull	off	another	million	before	lunch	;	pressure	*	to	anticipate	the	market	by	a	fraction	of	a	second	...	''
You	need	n't	be	a	high-powered	securities	lawyer	*	to	realize	0	the	prospectus	is	guilty	of	less	than	full	disclosure	.
The	slickly	produced	series	has	been	criticized	*-1	by	London	's	financial	cognoscenti	as	inaccurate	in	detail	,	but	its	major	weakness	is	its	unrealistic	depiction	of	the	characters	'	professional	and	private	lives	.
*-1	Turned	loose	in	Shane	Longman	's	trading	room	,	the	yuppie	dealers	do	little	right	.
*	Judging	by	the	money	lost	*	and	mistakes	made	*	in	the	early	episodes	,	Shane	Longman	's	capital	should	be	just	about	exhausted	by	the	final	13th	week	.
In	the	opening	episode	we	learn	that	Michelle	,	a	junior	bond	trader	,	has	indeed	pulled	off	another	million	before	lunch	.
Trouble	is	,	0	she	has	lost	it	just	as	quickly	.
Rather	than	*-1	keep	the	loss	a	secret	from	the	outside	world	,	Michelle	blabs	about	it	to	a	sandwich	man	while	*	ordering	lunch	over	the	phone	.
Little	chance	that	Shane	Longman	is	going	*-1	to	recoup	today	.
Traders	spend	the	morning	*	frantically	selling	bonds	,	in	the	belief	that	the	U.S.	monthly	trade	figures	will	look	lousy	.
Ah	,	perfidious	Columbia	!
The	trade	figures	turn	out	well	,	and	all	those	recently	unloaded	bonds	spurt	in	price	.
So	much	for	*	anticipating	the	market	by	a	fraction	of	a	second	.
And	a	large	slice	of	the	first	episode	is	devoted	*-1	to	efforts	*	to	get	rid	of	some	nearly	worthless	Japanese	bonds	-LRB-	since	when	is	anything	Japanese	nearly	worthless	nowadays	*T*-3	?	-RRB-	.
Surprisingly	,	Shane	Longman	survives	the	week	,	only	*	to	have	a	senior	executive	innocently	bumble	his	way	into	*	becoming	the	target	of	a	criminal	insider	trading	investigation	.
Instead	of	*	closing	ranks	*	to	protect	the	firm	's	reputation	,	the	executive	's	internal	rivals	,	led	*	by	a	loutish	American	,	demand	his	resignation	.
The	plot	is	thwarted	*-1	when	the	firm	's	major	stockholder	,	kelp	farming	on	the	other	side	of	the	globe	,	hurries	home	*	to	support	the	executive	*T*-3	.
But	the	investigation	continues	.
If	you	can	swallow	the	premise	that	the	rewards	for	such	ineptitude	are	six-figure	salaries	,	you	still	are	left	*-1	puzzled	,	because	few	of	the	yuppies	consume	very	conspicuously	.
In	fact	,	few	consume	much	of	anything	.
Two	share	a	house	almost	devoid	of	furniture	.
Michelle	lives	in	a	hotel	room	,	and	although	she	drives	a	canary-colored	Porsche	,	she	has	n't	time	0	*	to	clean	or	repair	it	*T*-3	;	the	beat-up	vehicle	can	be	started	*-1	only	with	a	huge	pair	of	pliers	because	the	ignition	key	has	broken	off	in	the	lock	.
And	it	*EXP*-1	takes	Declan	,	the	obligatory	ladies	'	man	of	the	cast	,	until	the	third	episode	*	to	get	past	first	base	with	any	of	his	prey	.
Perhaps	the	explanation	for	these	anomalies	is	that	class-conscious	Britain	is	n't	ready	*	to	come	to	terms	with	the	wealth	created	*	by	the	Thatcherian	free-enterprise	regime	.
After	all	,	this	is	n't	old	money	,	but	new	money	,	and	in	many	cases	,	young	money	.
This	attitude	is	clearly	illustrated	*-1	in	the	treatment	of	Max	,	the	trading	room	's	most	flamboyant	character	.
Yuppily	enough	,	he	lives	in	a	lavishly	furnished	converted	church	,	wears	designer	clothes	and	drives	an	antique	car	.
But	apparently	*	to	make	him	palatable	,	even	lovable	,	to	the	masses	,	the	script	inflates	pony-tailed	Max	into	an	eccentric	genius	,	master	of	11	Chinese	dialects	.
He	takes	his	wash	to	the	laundromat	,	where	he	meets	a	punky	French	girl	who	*T*-1	dupes	him	into	*	providing	a	home	for	her	pet	piranha	and	then	promptly	steals	his	car	and	dumps	it	in	Dieppe	*T*-3	.
In	*	producing	and	promoting	``	Capital	City	,	''	Thames	has	spent	about	as	much	as	Shane	Longman	loses	on	a	good	day	.
The	production	costs	are	a	not	inconsiderable	#	8	million	*U*	-LRB-	$	12.4	million	*U*	-RRB-	,	and	would	have	been	much	higher	had	not	the	cost	of	the	trading	floor	set	been	absorbed	in	the	budget	of	``	Dealers	,	''	an	earlier	made-for-TV	movie	.
Another	half	million	quid	went	for	a	volley	of	full-page	advertisements	in	six	major	British	newspapers	and	for	huge	posters	in	the	London	subway	.
These	expenses	create	a	special	incentive	for	``	Capital	City	's	''	producers	to	flog	it	,	or	a	Yank-oriented	version	of	it	,	in	America	.
Thames	's	U.S.	marketing	agent	,	Donald	Taffner	,	is	preparing	*-1	to	do	just	that	.
He	is	discreetly	hopeful	,	*	citing	three	U.S.	comedy	series	--	``	Three	's	Company	,	''	``	Too	Close	for	Comfort	''	and	``	*	Check	It	Out	''	--	that	*T*-1	had	British	antecedents	.
Perhaps	without	*-1	realizing	it	,	Mr.	Taffner	simultaneously	has	put	his	finger	on	the	problem	and	an	ideal	solution	:	``	Capital	City	''	should	have	been	a	comedy	,	a	worthy	sequel	to	the	screwball	British	``	Carry	On	''	movies	of	the	1960s	.
The	seeds	already	are	in	the	script	.
The	first	episode	concluded	with	a	marvelously	cute	scene	in	which	the	trading-room	crew	minded	a	baby	,	the	casualty	of	a	broken	marriage	at	the	firm	*T*-2	.
And	many	in	the	young	cast	bear	striking	resemblances	to	American	TV	and	movie	personalities	known	*	for	light	roles	.
Joanna	Kanska	looks	like	a	young	Zsa	Zsa	Gabor	;	William	Armstrong	,	who	*T*-1	plays	Max	,	could	pass	for	Hans	Conreid	,	and	Douglas	Hodge	-LRB-	Declan	-RRB-	for	James	Farentino	;	Rolf	Saxon	is	a	passable	Tommy	Noonan	and	Dorian	Healy	could	easily	double	for	Huntz	Hall	,	the	blank-faced	foil	of	the	Bowery	Boys	comedies	.
So	,	OK	kids	,	everybody	*?*	on	stage	for	``	*	Carry	On	*-2	Trading	''	:	The	cast	is	frantically	searching	the	office	for	misplaced	Japanese	bonds	that	suddenly	*T*-1	have	soared	in	value	because	Dai-Ichi	Kangyo	Bank	has	just	bought	the	White	House	.
The	pressure	is	too	much	for	Zsa	Zsa	,	who	*T*-1	slaps	a	security	guard	.
He	backflips	into	a	desktop	computer	terminal	,	which	*T*-1	explodes	,	*-2	covering	Huntz	Hall	's	face	with	microchips	.
And	all	the	while	,	the	bonds	are	in	the	baby	's	diaper	.
It	should	run	forever	.

Axa-Midi	Assurances	of	France	gave	details	of	its	financing	plans	for	its	proposed	$	4.5	billion	*U*	acquisition	of	Farmers	Group	Inc.	,	in	amended	filings	with	insurance	regulators	in	the	nine	U.S.	states	where	Farmers	operates	*T*-1	.
The	proposed	acquisition	is	part	of	Sir	James	Goldsmith	's	unfriendly	takeover	attempt	for	B.A.T	Industries	PLC	,	the	British	tobacco	,	retailing	,	paper	and	financial	services	concern	that	*T*-1	is	parent	of	Los	Angeles-based	Farmers	.
In	an	attempt	*	to	appease	U.S.	regulators	'	concern	over	a	Goldsmith	acquisition	of	Farmers	,	Sir	James	in	August	agreed	*-1	to	sell	Farmers	to	Axa	if	he	is	successful	in	*-2	acquiring	B.A.T	.
As	part	of	the	agreement	,	Axa	agreed	*-1	to	invest	$	1	billion	*U*	in	Hoylake	Investments	Ltd.	,	Sir	James	's	acquisition	vehicle	.
Of	the	total	$	5.5	billion	*U*	0	*T*-4	to	be	paid	*-3	to	Hoylake	by	Axa	,	about	$	1	billion	*U*	*T*-1	will	come	from	available	resources	of	Axa	's	parent	,	Axa-Midi	Group	,	$	2.25	billion	*U*	*T*-1	will	be	in	the	form	of	notes	issued	*	by	Axa	,	and	the	remaining	$	2.25	billion	*U*	*T*-1	will	be	in	long-term	bank	loans	.
In	an	interview	Thursday	,	Claude	Bebear	,	chairman	and	chief	executive	officer	of	Axa	,	said	0	his	group	has	already	obtained	assurances	*ICH*-1	from	a	group	of	banks	led	*	by	Cie	.	Financiere	de	Paribas	that	they	can	provide	the	loan	portion	of	the	financing	.
The	other	banking	companies	in	the	group	are	Credit	Lyonnais	,	Societe	Generale	,	BankAmerica	Corp.	and	Citicorp	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Bebear	said	0	Axa-Midi	Group	has	``	more	than	$	2.5	billion	*U*	of	non-strategic	assets	that	we	can	and	will	sell	''	*T*-1	*-2	to	help	*-3	pay	off	debt	from	the	acquisition	.
He	said	0	the	assets	0	*T*-2	to	be	sold	*-3	would	be	``	non-insurance	''	assets	,	including	a	beer	company	and	a	real	estate	firm	,	and	would	n't	include	any	pieces	of	Farmers	.
``	We	wo	n't	put	any	burden	on	Farmers	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
The	amended	filings	also	point	out	that	under	a	new	agreement	,	Hoylake	has	an	absolute	obligation	*	to	sell	Farmers	to	Axa	upon	an	acquisition	of	B.A.T	.
``	We	hope	that	with	what	we	did	*T*-1	,	the	regulators	will	not	need	*-2	to	evaluate	Hoylake	,	and	they	can	directly	look	at	the	agreement	with	us	,	because	Hoylake	wo	n't	be	an	owner	of	Farmers	at	anytime	,	''	Mr.	Bebear	said	*T*-3	.
Any	change	of	control	in	Farmers	needs	approval	of	the	insurance	commissioners	in	the	nine	states	where	Farmers	and	its	related	companies	are	incorporated	*-1	*T*-2	.
The	amended	filings	were	required	*-1	because	of	the	new	agreement	between	Axa	and	Hoylake	,	and	*	to	reflect	the	extension	that	Sir	James	received	*T*-2	last	month	under	British	takeover	rules	*	to	complete	his	proposed	acquisition	.
Hoylake	dropped	its	initial	#	13.35	billion	*U*	-LRB-	$	20.71	billion	*U*	-RRB-	takeover	bid	after	it	received	the	extension	,	but	said	0	it	would	launch	a	new	bid	if	and	when	the	propsed	sale	of	Farmers	to	Axa	receives	regulatory	approval	*T*-1	.
A	spokesman	for	B.A.T	said	of	the	amended	filings	that	,	``	It	would	appear	that	nothing	substantive	has	changed	.
The	new	financing	structure	is	still	a	very-highly	leveraged	one	,	and	Axa	still	plans	*-1	to	take	out	75	%	of	Farmers	'	earnings	as	dividends	*-2	to	service	their	debt	.	''
That	dividend	is	almost	double	the	35	%	currently	taken	out	of	Farmers	by	B.A.T	,	the	spokesman	added	0	*T*-1	.
``	It	would	have	severe	implications	for	Farmers	'	policy	holders	.	''
*-2	To	fend	off	Sir	James	's	advances	,	B.A.T	has	proposed	a	sweeping	restructuring	that	*T*-1	would	pare	it	to	a	tobacco	and	financial	services	concern	.
Dismal	sales	at	General	Motors	Corp.	dragged	the	U.S.	car	and	truck	market	down	below	year-ago	levels	in	early	October	,	the	first	sales	period	of	the	1990	model	year	.
The	eight	major	domestic	auto	makers	sold	160,510	North	American-made	cars	in	the	first	10	days	of	October	,	a	12.6	%	drop	from	a	year	earlier	.
Domestically	built	truck	sales	were	down	10.4	%	to	86,555	pickups	,	vans	and	sport	utility	vehicles	.
The	heavy	use	of	incentives	*	to	clear	out	1989	models	appears	*-2	to	have	taken	the	steam	,	at	least	initially	,	out	of	1990	model	sales	,	which	*T*-1	began	officially	Oct.	1	.
This	appears	particularly	true	at	GM	,	which	*T*-1	had	strong	sales	in	August	and	September	but	saw	its	early	October	car	and	truck	results	fall	26.3	%	from	last	year	's	unusually	high	level	.
Overall	,	sales	of	all	domestic-made	vehicles	fell	11.9	%	from	a	year	ago	.
Without	GM	,	overall	sales	for	the	other	U.S.	automakers	were	roughly	flat	with	1989	results	.
Some	of	the	U.S.	auto	makers	have	already	adopted	incentives	on	many	1990	models	,	but	they	may	have	*	to	broaden	their	programs	*-1	to	keep	sales	up	.
``	We	've	created	a	condition	where	,	without	incentives	,	it	's	a	tough	market	*T*-2	,	''	said	*T*-1	Tom	Kelly	,	sales	manager	for	Bill	Wink	Chevrolet	in	Dearborn	,	Mich	.
Car	sales	fell	to	a	seasonally	adjusted	annual	selling	rate	of	5.8	million	vehicles	,	the	lowest	since	October	1987	.
The	poor	performance	contrasts	with	a	robust	selling	rate	of	almost	eight	million	last	month	.
Furthermore	,	dealers	contacted	late	last	week	said	0	they	could	n't	see	any	immediate	impact	on	sales	of	Friday	's	steep	market	decline	.
GM	's	domestic	car	sales	dropped	24.3	%	and	its	domestic	trucks	were	down	an	even	steeper	28.7	%	from	the	same	period	a	year	ago	.
All	of	the	GM	divisions	except	Cadillac	showed	big	declines	.
Cadillac	posted	a	3.2	%	increase	despite	new	competition	from	Lexus	,	the	fledging	luxury-car	division	of	Toyota	Motor	Corp	.
Lexus	sales	were	n't	available	;	the	cars	are	imported	*-1	and	Toyota	reports	their	sales	only	at	month-end	.
The	sales	drop	for	the	No.	1	car	maker	may	have	been	caused	*-3	in	part	by	the	end	in	September	of	dealer	incentives	that	GM	offered	*T*-1	in	addition	to	consumer	rebates	and	low-interest	financing	,	a	company	spokesman	said	0	*T*-2	.
Last	year	,	GM	had	a	different	program	*ICH*-3	in	place	that	*T*-2	continued	*-4	rewarding	dealers	until	all	the	1989	models	had	been	sold	*-1	.
Aside	from	GM	,	other	car	makers	posted	generally	mixed	results	.
Ford	Motor	Co.	had	a	1.8	%	drop	in	domestic	car	sales	but	a	2.4	%	increase	in	domestic	truck	sales	.
Chrysler	Corp.	had	a	7.5	%	drop	in	car	sales	,	*	echoing	its	generally	slow	performance	all	year	.
However	,	sales	of	trucks	,	including	the	company	's	popular	minivans	,	rose	4.3	%	.
Honda	Motor	Co.	's	sales	of	domestically	built	vehicles	plunged	21.7	%	from	a	year	earlier	.
Honda	's	plant	in	Marysville	,	Ohio	,	was	gearing	up	*	to	build	1990	model	Accords	,	a	Honda	spokesman	said	0	*T*-1	.
``	We	're	really	confident	0	everything	will	bounce	back	to	normal	,	''	he	added	*T*-1	.
Separately	,	Chrysler	said	0	firm	prices	on	its	1990-model	domestic	cars	and	minivans	will	rise	an	average	of	5	%	over	comparably	equipped	1989	models	.
Firm	prices	were	generally	in	line	with	the	tentative	prices	announced	*	earlier	this	fall	.
At	that	time	,	Chrysler	said	0	base	prices	,	which	*T*-2	are	n't	adjusted	*-1	for	equipment	changes	,	would	rise	between	4	%	and	9	%	*U*	on	most	vehicle	.
a	-	Totals	include	only	vehicle	sales	reported	*	in	period	.

It	was	n't	so	long	ago	that	a	radio	network	funded	*	by	the	U.S.	Congress	--	and	originally	by	the	Central	Intelligence	Agency	--	was	accused	*-1	by	officials	here	of	*-3	employing	propagandists	,	imperialists	and	spies	*T*-2	.
Now	,	the	network	has	opened	a	news	bureau	in	the	Hungarian	capital	.
Employees	held	an	open	house	*-1	to	celebrate	and	even	hung	out	a	sign	:	``	Szabad	Europa	Radio	''	--	Radio	Free	Europe	.
``	I	think	0	this	is	a	victory	for	the	radio	,	''	says	*T*-2	Barnabas	de	Bueky	,	a	55-year-old	former	Hungarian	refugee	who	*T*-1	works	in	the	Munich	,	West	Germany	,	headquarters	as	deputy	director	of	the	Hungarian	service	.
In	fact	,	the	network	hopes	*-2	to	set	up	offices	in	Warsaw	and	anywhere	else	in	the	East	Bloc	that	*T*-1	will	have	it	.
But	the	rapid	changes	brought	on	by	glasnost	and	open	borders	are	altering	the	network	's	life	in	more	ways	than	one	.
In	fact	,	Radio	Free	Europe	is	in	danger	of	*-1	suffering	from	its	success	.
While	the	network	currently	can	operate	freely	in	Budapest	,	so	can	*?*	*T*-1	others	.
In	addition	,	competition	for	listeners	is	getting	tougher	in	many	ways	than	when	*	broadcasting	here	was	strictly	controlled	*-3	*T*-2	.
Instead	of	*-2	being	denounced	*-1	as	an	evil	agent	of	imperialism	,	Radio	Free	Europe	is	more	likely	*	to	draw	the	criticism	that	its	programs	are	too	tame	,	even	boring	.
``	They	have	a	lot	0	*	to	do	*T*-2	these	days	*	to	compete	with	Hungarian	radio	,	''	says	*T*-1	Andrew	Deak	,	a	computer-science	student	at	the	Technical	University	in	Budapest	.
``	The	Hungarian	-LCB-	radio	-RCB-	reporters	seem	better	informed	and	more	critical	about	about	what	*T*-1	's	going	on	here	.	''
Indeed	,	Hungary	is	in	the	midst	of	a	media	explosion	.
Boys	on	busy	street	corners	peddle	newspapers	of	every	political	stripe	.
Newsstands	are	packed	with	a	colorful	array	of	magazines	.
Radio	and	television	are	getting	livelier	and	bolder	.
The	British	Broadcasting	Corp.	and	the	U.S.	State	Department	's	Voice	of	America	broadcast	over	Hungarian	airwaves	,	though	only	a	few	hours	a	day	each	in	Hungarian	.
Australian	press	magnate	Rupert	Murdoch	has	bought	50	%	stakes	in	two	popular	and	gossipy	Hungarian	newspapers	,	while	Britain	's	Robert	Maxwell	has	let	it	*EXP*-2	be	known	*-1	here	that	he	is	thinking	about	similar	moves	.
But	Radio	Free	Europe	does	n't	plan	*-1	to	fade	away	.
With	its	mission	for	free	speech	and	the	capitalist	way	,	the	network	's	staff	says	0	it	still	has	plenty	0	*	to	do	*T*-1	--	in	Hungary	and	in	the	``	Great	Eastern	Beyond	.	''
Radio	Free	Europe	and	its	sister	station	for	the	Soviet	Union	,	Radio	Liberty	,	say	0	they	wo	n't	cut	back	their	more	than	19	hours	of	daily	broadcasts	.
They	are	still	an	important	source	of	news	for	60	million	listeners	in	23	exotic	tongues	:	from	Bulgarian	and	Belorussian	to	Kazakh	and	Kirghiz	.
The	establishment	of	its	first	bureau	in	Warsaw	Pact	territory	shows	the	depth	of	some	of	the	changes	in	Eastern	Europe	.
Months	before	the	decision	*ICH*-1	by	the	Hungarian	Communist	Party	*	to	rename	itself	Socialist	and	try	*-2	to	look	more	appealing	to	voters	,	the	country	's	rulers	were	trying	*-3	to	look	more	hospitable	.
It	*EXP*-1	proved	a	perfect	time	for	Radio	Free	Europe	to	ask	for	permission	*	to	set	up	office	.
Not	only	did	the	Hungarian	Ministry	of	Foreign	Affairs	approve	Radio	Free	Europe	's	new	location	,	but	the	Ministry	of	Telecommunications	did	something	even	more	amazing	:	``	They	found	us	four	phone	lines	in	central	Budapest	,	''	says	*T*-2	Geza	Szocs	,	a	Radio	Free	Europe	correspondent	who	*T*-1	helped	*-3	organize	the	Budapest	location	.
``	That	is	a	miracle	.	''
It	's	a	far	cry	from	the	previous	treatment	of	the	network	,	which	*T*-1	had	*-3	to	overcome	jamming	of	its	frequencies	and	intimidation	of	local	correspondents	-LRB-	who	*T*-2	filed	reports	to	the	network	by	phone	,	secret	messengers	or	letters	-RRB-	.
In	fact	,	some	of	the	network	's	Hungarian	listeners	say	0	they	owe	Radio	Free	Europe	loyalty	because	it	was	responsible	in	many	ways	for	*	keeping	hope	alive	through	what	one	writer	here	calls	*T*-1	the	``	Dark	Ages	of	the	20th	Century	.	''
``	During	the	past	four	years	,	many	of	us	have	sat	up	until	late	at	night	*	listening	to	our	radios	,	''	says	*T*-1	the	writer	.
``	There	were	some	very	brave	broadcasts	.	''
The	listeners	,	too	,	had	*-1	to	be	brave	.
Through	much	of	the	post-World	War	II	period	,	*	listening	to	Western	broadcasts	was	a	crime	in	Hungary	.
``	When	we	listen	to	the	Europe	station	*T*-1	,	my	mother	still	gets	nervous	,	''	says	*T*-2	a	Budapest	translator	.
``	She	wants	*-1	to	turn	down	the	volume	and	close	the	curtains	.	''
Now	,	the	toughest	competition	for	Radio	Free	Europe	comes	during	the	late-night	slot	.
Hungarian	radio	often	saves	its	most	politically	outspoken	broadcasts	for	around	midnight	.
Television	,	which	most	of	the	time	*T*-3	is	considered	*-1	rather	tame	,	has	entered	the	running	with	a	new	program	,	``	The	End	of	the	Day	,	''	which	*T*-2	comes	on	after	11	p.m	.
It	is	a	talk	show	with	opposition	leaders	and	political	experts	who	*T*-1	discuss	Hungary	's	domestic	problems	as	well	as	foreign	affairs	.
Those	who	*T*-1	want	*-2	to	hear	even	more	radical	views	have	*-3	to	get	up	at	five	on	Sunday	morning	for	``	Sunday	Journal	,	''	on	Hungarian	Radio	.
The	competitive	spirit	is	clearly	influencing	Radio	Free	Europe	,	which	*T*-1	is	trying	*-2	to	beef	up	programs	.
The	Budapest	office	plans	*-1	to	hire	free-lance	reporters	*	to	cover	the	latest	happenings	in	Hungarian	country	towns	from	Nagykanizsa	in	the	west	to	Nyiregyhaza	in	the	east	.
The	Hungarian	service	has	a	daily	40-minute	news	show	called	*	Newsreel	,	with	international	and	domestic	news	,	plus	a	daily	news	review	of	opinions	from	around	the	world	.
There	's	also	a	host	of	new	programs	,	trying	*	to	lighten	up	on	the	traditional	diet	of	politics	.
A	daily	35-minute	program	called	*	``	The	March	of	Time	''	tries	*-1	to	find	interesting	tidbits	of	lighthearted	news	and	gossip	from	around	the	world	.
There	's	a	program	for	women	and	a	science	show	.
And	*	to	attract	younger	listeners	,	Radio	Free	Europe	intersperses	the	latest	in	Western	rock	groups	.
The	Pet	Shop	Boys	are	big	this	year	in	Budapest	.
``	We	are	starving	for	all	the	news	,	''	says	*T*-1	Mr.	Deak	,	the	student	.
``	Every	moment	we	want	*-1	to	know	everything	about	the	world	.
Proposals	for	government-operated	``	national	service	,	''	like	influenza	,	flare	up	from	time	to	time	,	depress	the	resistance	of	the	body	politic	,	run	their	course	,	and	seem	*-1	to	disappear	,	only	*	to	mutate	and	afflict	public	life	anew	.
The	disease	metaphor	comes	to	mind	,	of	course	,	not	as	an	aspersion	on	the	advocates	of	national	service	.
Rather	,	it	is	born	*-1	of	frustration	with	*	having	*-3	to	combat	constantly	changing	strains	of	a	statist	idea	that	one	thought	0	*T*-4	had	been	eliminated	*-2	in	the	early	1970s	,	along	with	smallpox	.
It	is	back	with	us	again	,	in	the	form	of	legislation	*	to	pay	volunteers	under	a	``	National	and	Community	Service	Act	,	''	a	proposal	with	a	serious	shot	at	congressional	passage	this	fall	.
Why	does	the	national-service	virus	keep	coming	back	*T*-1	?
Perhaps	it	is	because	utopian	nostalgia	evokes	both	military	experience	and	the	social	gospel	.
If	only	we	could	get	America	's	wastrel	youth	into	at	least	a	psychic	uniform	we	might	be	able	*	to	teach	self-discipline	again	and	revive	the	spirit	of	giving	.
A	quarter	of	a	century	ago	national	service	was	promoted	*-1	as	a	way	of	*	curing	the	manifest	inequities	of	the	draft	--	by	,	of	all	things	,	*	expanding	the	draft	.
Those	of	us	who	*T*-1	resisted	the	idea	then	suspect	today	that	an	obligation	of	government	service	for	all	young	people	is	still	the	true	long-term	aim	of	many	national-service	backers	,	despite	their	protests	that	present	plans	contain	no	coercion	.
Choice	of	the	volunteer	military	in	the	1970s	seemed	*-1	to	doom	national	service	as	much	as	the	draft	.
But	the	virus	was	kept	*-1	alive	in	sociology	departments	until	a	couple	of	years	ago	,	when	it	again	was	let	*-2	loose	*T*-3	.
This	time	it	attempted	*-1	to	invade	two	connected	problems	,	the	rising	cost	of	higher	education	and	the	rising	expense	to	the	federal	government	of	educational	grants	and	loans	.
Why	not	*	keep	*RNR*-1	and	even	expand	*RNR*-1	the	loans	and	grants	,	the	advocates	reasoned	*T*-2	,	but	*	require	some	form	of	service	from	each	recipient	?
Military	service	,	moreover	,	could	be	a	national-service	option	.
Thus	,	undoubtedly	it	*EXP*-2	was	hoped	*-1	that	the	new	strain	of	national	service	would	prove	contagious	,	*	infecting	patriotic	conservatives	,	pay-as-you-go	moderates	,	and	idealistic	liberals	.
The	Democratic	Leadership	Council	,	a	centrist	group	sponsoring	the	plan	,	surely	thought	0	it	might	help	the	party	to	attract	support	,	especially	among	college	students	and	their	parents	.
A	provision	allowing	grants	*-2	to	be	applied	*-2	to	first-home	purchases	was	added	*-1	*	to	appeal	to	those	who	*T*-3	had	had	enough	of	schooling	.
The	DLC	plan	envisaged	``	volunteers	''	planting	trees	*RNR*-1	,	emptying	bedpans	*RNR*-1	,	tutoring	children	*RNR*-1	,	and	assisting	librarians	*RNR*-1	for	$	100	*U*	a	week	,	tax	free	,	plus	medical	care	.
With	a	tax-free	$	10,000	*U*	voucher	payment	at	the	end	of	each	year	,	the	volunteers	would	be	making	a	wage	comparable	to	$	17,500	*U*	a	year	.
Mind	you	,	most	of	``	the	volunteers	''	would	be	unskilled	17	-	to	18-year-olds	,	some	not	even	high	school	graduates	,	and	many	saving	money	by	*-1	living	at	home	.
They	would	be	doing	better	financially	under	national	service	than	many	taxpayers	working	at	the	same	kinds	of	jobs	and	perhaps	supporting	families	.
As	it	happened	,	political	resistance	developed	among	educational	and	minority	interests	that	*T*-1	count	on	the	present	education	grant	system	,	so	the	national-service	devotees	decided	*-2	to	abandon	the	supposedly	crucial	principle	of	``	*	give	in	order	*	to	get	.	''
Opposition	to	national	service	from	the	Pentagon	,	which	*T*-2	wants	*-3	to	protect	its	own	recruitment	process	,	also	led	to	the	military-service	option	being	dropped	*-1	.
Clearly	,	a	new	rationale	for	national	service	had	*-1	to	be	cooked	up	.
What	better	place	0	*	to	turn	*T*-3	than	Sen.	Edward	Kennedy	's	Labor	Committee	,	that	great	stove	of	government	expansionism	,	where	many	a	stagnant	pot	of	porridge	is	kept	*-1	on	the	back	burner	until	it	can	be	brought	forward	and	presented	as	nouvelle	cuisine	*T*-2	?
In	this	case	,	the	new	recipe	for	national	service	called	for	*	throwing	many	assorted	legislative	leftovers	into	one	kettle	:	a	demonstration	project	for	educational	aid	-LRB-	particularly	satisfying	to	the	DLC	and	Sen.	Sam	Nunn	-RRB-	,	a	similar	demonstration	program	for	youth	conservation	-LRB-	a	la	Sen.	Chris	Dodd	-RRB-	,	a	competitive	grants	program	to	states	0	*T*-1	to	spark	youth	and	senior	citizen	volunteer	projects	-LRB-	a	Kennedy	specialty	-RRB-	,	a	community	service	work-study	program	for	students	-LRB-	pleasing	to	the	palate	of	Sen.	Dale	Bumpers	,	among	others	-RRB-	,	plus	engorgement	of	the	VISTA	volunteer	program	and	the	Retired	Senior	Volunteer	,	Foster	Grandparent	,	and	Senior	Companion	programs	.
Before	the	menu	is	printed	*-1	,	the	House	may	add	more	ingredients	,	also	*	changing	the	initial	price	,	now	posted	at	some	$	330	million	*U*	.
It	is	widely	known	*-1	that	``	too	many	cooks	spoil	the	broth	,	''	but	that	wisdom	does	not	necessarily	reflect	the	view	of	the	cooks	,	especially	if	they	are	senators	.
The	``	omnibus	''	bill	coming	out	of	Congress	may	be	unwholesome	glop	,	but	the	assorted	chefs	are	happy	and	the	restaurant	is	pushing	the	dish	very	hard	.
The	aroma	of	patronage	is	in	the	air	.
Is	the	voluntary	sector	so	weak	that	it	needs	such	unsolicited	assistance	?
On	the	contrary	,	it	is	as	robust	as	ever	.
According	to	the	Gallup	Poll	,	American	adults	contribute	an	average	of	two	hours	a	week	of	service	,	while	financial	contributions	to	charity	in	the	1980s	have	risen	30	%	-LRB-	adjusted	*	for	inflation	-RRB-	.
Even	if	government	does	see	various	``	unmet	needs	,	''	national	service	is	not	the	way	0	*	to	meet	them	*T*-1	.
If	we	want	*-1	to	support	students	,	we	might	adopt	the	idea	used	*	in	other	countries	of	*	offering	more	scholarships	based	*	on	something	called	*	``	scholarship	,	''	rather	than	on	the	government	's	idea	of	``	service	.	''
Or	we	might	provide	a	tax	credit	for	working	students	.
What	we	do	not	need	*	to	do	*T*-1	is	*	start	a	war	,	and	then	try	*-2	to	justify	it	by	*-3	creating	a	GI	Bill	.
To	the	extent	0	we	lack	manpower	0	*T*-3	to	staff	menial	jobs	in	hospitals	*T*-2	,	for	example	,	we	should	raise	pay	,	pursue	labor-saving	technology	,	or	allow	more	legal	immigration	,	rather	than	overpay	high	school	graduates	as	short-term	workers	and	cause	resentment	among	permanent	workers	paid	*	lesser	amounts	*-1	to	do	the	same	jobs	.
Will	national	service	,	in	the	current	highly	politicized	and	opportunistic	form	exert	enough	appeal	*	to	get	adopted	*-1	?
Not	necessarily	.
Polls	show	wide	,	generalized	support	for	some	vague	concept	of	service	,	but	the	bill	now	under	discussion	lacks	any	passionate	public	backing	.
Nonetheless	,	Senate	Democrats	are	organizing	a	roll	of	supporting	``	associations	,	''	``	societies	''	and	``	councils	,	''	some	of	which	*T*-1	may	hope	*-2	to	receive	the	paid	``	volunteers	.	''
So	far	,	the	president	seems	ill-disposed	*	to	substitute	any	of	the	omnibus	for	his	own	free-standing	proposal	*	to	endow	a	``	Points	of	Light	''	foundation	with	$	25	million	*U*	*	to	inform	citizens	of	all	ages	and	exhort	them	to	genuine	volunteerism	.
However	,	even	this	admirable	plan	could	become	objectionable	if	the	White	House	gives	in	to	congressional	Democratic	pressure	*	to	add	to	the	scope	of	the	president	's	initiative	or	*	to	involve	the	independent	foundation	in	*	``	brokering	''	federal	funds	for	volunteer	projects	.
There	's	no	need	for	such	concessions	.
The	omnibus	can	be	defeated	*-1	,	the	virus	controlled	*-3	,	and	real	service	protected	*-4	.
National	service	,	the	utopian	idea	,	still	wo	n't	go	away	then	,	of	course	,	but	the	millions	of	knee-socked	youth	performing	works	of	``	civic	content	''	will	be	mobilized	*-1	only	in	the	imagination	of	their	progenitors	.

Drug	Emporium	Inc.	said	0	Gary	Wilber	,	39	years	old	,	who	*T*-2	had	been	president	and	chief	operating	officer	for	the	past	year	,	was	named	*-1	chief	executive	officer	of	this	drugstore	chain	.

American	Physicians	Service	Group	Inc.	said	0	it	purchased	about	42	%	of	Prime	Medical	Services	Inc.	for	about	$	5	million	*U*	from	Texas	American	Energy	Corp	.
American	Physicians	said	0	it	also	replaced	four	Texas	American	representatives	on	Prime	's	five-member	board	.
American	provides	a	variety	of	financial	services	to	doctors	and	hospitals	.
Prime	,	based	*	in	Bedminster	,	N.J.	,	provides	management	services	to	cardiac	rehabilitation	clinics	and	diagnostic	imaging	centers	.
For	the	year	ended	June	30	,	Prime	had	a	net	loss	of	$	3	million	*U*	on	sales	of	$	13.8	million	*U*	.
The	inflation-adjusted	growth	rate	for	France	's	gross	domestic	product	for	the	second	quarter	was	revised	*-1	upward	to	0.8	%	from	the	previous	three	months	from	the	initial	estimate	of	0.7	%	,	the	National	Statistics	Institute	said	0	*T*-2	.
The	state	agency	said	0	the	latest	revision	left	the	growth	rate	for	the	first-quarter	compared	with	the	previous	three	months	unchanged	at	1.3	%	.
If	the	economy	continues	*-1	to	expand	by	0.8	%	a	quarter	for	the	rest	of	the	year	,	it	would	leave	GDP	growth	for	all	of	1989	at	3	%	,	the	institute	said	0	*T*-2	.
That	would	be	down	from	the	3.8	%	rise	posted	*	in	1988	.

The	bonds	go	on	sale	Oct.	19	.
The	debate	over	National	Service	has	begun	again	.
After	a	decade	in	which	more	than	50	localities	established	their	own	service	or	conservation	corps	and	dozens	of	school	systems	made	community	service	a	prerequisite	to	high-school	graduation	*T*-1	,	the	focus	has	shifted	to	Washington	.
At	least	10	bills	proposing	one	or	another	national	program	were	introduced	*-1	in	Congress	this	spring	.
One	,	co-sponsored	by	Sen.	Sam	Nunn	-LRB-	D.	,	Ga	.	-RRB-	and	Rep.	Dave	McCurdy	-LRB-	D.	,	Okla.	-RRB-	,	would	have	restricted	federal	college	subsidies	to	students	who	*T*-1	had	served	.
An	omnibus	bill	assembled	by	Sen.	Edward	Kennedy	-LRB-	D.	,	Mass.	-RRB-	,	and	including	some	diluted	Nunn-McCurdy	provisions	along	with	proposals	by	fellow	Democratic	Sens.	Claiborne	Pell	,	Barbara	Mikulski	and	Christopher	Dodd	,	has	been	reported	*-1	out	of	the	Senate	Labor	Committee	.
It	might	well	win	Senate	passage	.
President	Bush	has	outlined	his	own	Youth	Entering	Service	-LRB-	YES	-RRB-	plan	,	though	its	details	remain	*	to	be	specified	*-1	.
What	is	one	*-2	to	think	*T*-1	of	all	this	?
Doctrine	and	special	interests	govern	some	responses	.
People	eager	*	to	have	youth	``	pay	their	dues	to	society	''	favor	service	proposals	--	preferably	mandatory	ones	.
So	do	*T*-2	those	who	*T*-1	seek	a	``	re-energized	concept	of	citizenship	,	''	a	concept	imposing	stern	obligations	as	well	as	conferring	rights	.
Then	there	are	instinctive	opponents	.
To	libertarians	,	mandatory	service	is	an	abomination	and	voluntary	systems	are	illegitimate	uses	of	tax	money	.
Devotees	of	the	market	question	the	value	of	the	work	0	national	service	would	perform	*T*-1	:
If	the	market	wo	n't	pay	for	it	,	they	argue	,	it	ca	n't	be	worth	its	cost	.
Elements	of	the	left	are	also	reflexively	opposed	*-1	;	they	see	service	as	a	cover	for	the	draft	,	or	fear	the	regimentation	of	youth	,	or	want	*-2	to	see	rights	enlarged	*-3	,	not	obligations	*?*	*-4	.
But	what	about	those	of	us	whose	views	*T*-2	are	not	predetermined	*-1	by	formula	or	ideology	?
How	should	we	think	about	national	service	*T*-1	?
*	Let	's	begin	by	*-1	recognizing	a	main	source	of	confusion	--	``	national	service	''	has	no	agreed	meaning	.
Would	service	be	voluntary	or	compulsory	?
Short	or	long	?
Part-time	or	full-time	?
Paid	or	unpaid	?
Would	participants	live	at	home	and	work	nearby	or	live	in	barracks	and	work	on	public	lands	?
What	kinds	of	work	would	they	do	*T*-1	?
What	does	``	national	''	mean	*T*-1	?
Would	the	program	be	run	by	the	federal	government	,	by	local	governments	,	or	by	private	voluntary	organizations	?
And	who	*T*-1	would	serve	?
Only	males	,	as	with	the	draft	,	or	both	sexes	?
Youth	only	or	all	ages	?
Middle-class	people	,	or	poor	people	,	or	a	genuine	cross-section	?
Many	or	few	?
Those	are	not	trivial	questions	,	and	the	label	``	national	service	''	answers	none	of	them	.
Then	how	should	we	think	about	national	service	*T*-1	?
As	a	starting	point	,	here	are	five	propositions	:	1	.	*	Consider	the	ingredients	,	not	the	name	.
*	Ignore	``	national	service	''	in	the	abstract	;	*	consider	specific	proposals	.
They	will	differ	in	crucial	ways	.
2	.	``	Service	''	should	be	service	.
As	*	commonly	understood	*-1	,	service	implies	sacrifice	.
It	involves	*	accepting	risk	,	or	*	giving	up	income	,	or	*	deferring	a	career	.
It	follows	that	proposals	like	Nunn-McCurdy	,	whose	benefits	to	enrollees	*T*-1	are	worth	some	$	17,500	*U*	a	year	,	do	not	qualify	.
There	is	a	rationale	for	such	bills	:	Federal	subsidies	to	college	students	amount	to	``	a	GI	Bill	without	the	GI	''	;	arguably	those	benefits	should	be	earned	*-1	,	not	given	*-1	.
But	the	earnings	exceed	by	20	%	the	average	income	of	young	high-school	graduates	with	full-time	jobs	.
Why	*	call	that	service	?
3	.	Encouragement	is	fine	;	compulsion	is	not	*?*	.
Compelled	service	is	unconstitutional	.
It	is	also	unwise	and	unenforceable	.
-LRB-	Who	*T*-1	will	throw	several	hundred	thousand	refusers	in	jail	each	year	?	-RRB-
But	through	tax	policy	and	in	other	ways	the	federal	government	encourages	many	kinds	of	behavior	.
It	should	also	encourage	service	--	preferably	by	all	classes	and	all	ages	.
Its	encouragement	should	strengthen	*RNR*-1	and	not	undercut	*RNR*-1	the	strong	tradition	of	volunteering	in	the	U.S.	,	should	build	on	the	service	programs	already	in	existence	,	and	should	honor	local	convictions	about	which	tasks	*T*-2	most	need	doing	.
4	.	Good	programs	are	not	cheap	.
Enthusiasts	assume	that	national	service	would	get	important	work	done	cheaply	:	forest	fires	fought	*-1	,	housing	rehabilitated	*-2	,	students	tutored	*-3	,	day-care	centers	staffed	*-4	.
There	is	important	work	0	*T*-3	to	be	done	*-1	,	and	existing	service	and	conservation	corps	have	shown	that	even	youths	who	*T*-2	start	with	few	skills	can	do	much	of	it	well	--	but	not	cheaply	.
Good	service	programs	require	recruitment	,	screening	,	training	and	supervision	--	all	of	high	quality	.
They	involve	stipends	to	participants	.
Full-time	residential	programs	also	require	housing	and	full-time	supervision	;	they	are	particularly	expensive	--	more	per	participant	than	a	year	at	Stanford	or	Yale	.
Non-residential	programs	are	cheaper	,	but	good	ones	still	come	to	some	$	10,000	*U*	a	year	.
Are	they	worth	that	?
Evaluations	suggest	that	good	ones	are	*?*	--	especially	so	if	the	effects	on	participants	are	counted	*-1	.
But	the	calculations	are	challengeable	.
5	.	Underclass	youth	are	a	special	concern	.
Are	such	expenditures	worthwhile	,	then	?
Yes	,	if	*	targeted	*-1	.
People	of	all	ages	and	all	classes	should	be	encouraged	*-1	to	serve	,	but	there	are	many	ways	for	middle-class	kids	,	and	their	elders	,	to	serve	at	little	public	cost	.
They	can	volunteer	at	any	of	thousands	of	non-profit	institutions	,	or	participate	in	service	programs	required	*	by	high	schools	or	encouraged	*	by	colleges	or	employers	.
Underclass	youth	do	n't	have	those	opportunities	.
They	are	not	enrolled	in	high	school	or	college	.
They	are	unlikely	*	to	be	employed	*-1	.
And	they	have	grown	up	in	unprecedentedly	grim	circumstances	,	among	family	structures	breaking	down	,	*-1	surrounded	by	self-destructive	behaviors	and	bleak	prospects	.
But	many	of	them	can	be	quite	profoundly	reoriented	*-1	by	productive	and	disciplined	service	.
Some	wo	n't	accept	the	discipline	;	others	drop	out	for	other	reasons	.
But	some	whom	nothing	else	is	reaching	*T*-2	are	transformed	*-1	.
*	Learning	skills	,	producing	something	cooperatively	,	feeling	useful	,	they	are	no	longer	dependent	--	others	now	depend	on	them	.
Even	if	it	*EXP*-1	is	cheaper	*	to	build	playgrounds	or	paint	apartments	or	plant	dune-grass	with	paid	professionals	,	the	effects	on	the	young	people	providing	those	services	alter	the	calculation	.
*	Strictly	speaking	,	these	youth	are	not	performing	service	.
They	are	giving	up	no	income	,	deferring	no	careers	,	incurring	no	risk	.
But	they	believe	themselves	to	be	serving	,	and	they	begin	*-1	to	respect	themselves	-LRB-	and	others	-RRB-	,	to	take	control	of	their	lives	,	to	think	of	the	future	.
That	is	a	service	to	the	nation	.
It	is	what	federal	support	should	try	hardest	*-2	to	achieve	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Szanton	,	a	Carter	administration	budget	official	,	heads	his	own	Washington-based	strategic	planning	firm	.
He	is	a	co-author	of	``	National	Service	:	What	Would	It	Mean	*T*-1	?	''
-LRB-	Lexington	Books	,	1986	-RRB-	.
Government	officials	here	and	in	other	countries	laid	plans	*ICH*-1	through	the	weekend	*	to	head	off	a	Monday	market	meltdown	--	but	went	out	of	their	way	*-2	to	keep	their	moves	quiet	.
Federal	Reserve	Chairman	Alan	Greenspan	was	on	the	telephones	,	*	making	it	*EXP*-1	clear	to	officials	in	the	U.S.	and	abroad	that	the	Fed	was	prepared	*	to	inject	massive	amounts	of	money	into	the	banking	system	,	as	it	did	in	October	1987	,	if	the	action	were	needed	*	to	prevent	a	financial	crisis	.
And	at	the	Treasury	,	Secretary	Nicholas	Brady	talked	with	friends	and	associates	on	Wall	Street	while	Assistant	Secretary	David	Mullins	carefully	analyzed	data	on	the	Friday	market	plunge	.
But	the	officials	feared	that	any	public	announcements	would	only	increase	market	jitters	.
In	addition	,	officials	at	the	Fed	and	in	the	Bush	administration	decided	that	*	avoiding	overt	actions	and	statements	over	the	weekend	would	give	them	more	strength	and	flexibility	should	Friday	's	market	drop	turn	into	this	morning	's	rout	.
``	The	disadvantage	at	this	point	is	that	anything	0	you	do	*T*-2	that	*T*-1	looks	like	you	are	doing	too	much	tends	*-4	to	reinforce	a	sense	of	crisis	,	''	said	*T*-3	one	government	official	,	insisting	on	anonymity	.
The	Fed	's	efforts	at	secrecy	were	partly	foiled	*-1	Sunday	morning	,	when	both	the	New	York	Times	and	the	Washington	Post	carried	stories	quoting	a	senior	Fed	official	saying	0	the	central	bank	was	prepared	*	to	pour	cash	into	the	banking	system	Monday	morning	*T*-2	.
Fed	Chairman	Greenspan	was	surprised	*-1	by	both	stories	,	according	to	knowledgeable	sources	,	and	insisted	0	he	had	n't	authorized	any	public	comment	.
Nevertheless	,	Fed	officials	acknowledged	0	the	stories	were	reasonably	accurate	portrayals	of	the	central	bank	's	game	plan	.
It	is	prepared	*	to	assume	the	same	role	0	it	played	*T*-2	in	October	1987	,	*	providing	money	to	the	markets	if	*	necessary	*	to	keep	the	financial	system	afloat	.
The	Fed	provides	money	to	the	banking	system	by	*-1	buying	government	securities	from	financial	institutions	.
The	reticence	of	federal	officials	was	evident	in	the	appearance	Sunday	of	Budget	Director	Richard	Darman	on	ABC	's	``	This	Week	.	''
``	Secretary	of	the	Treasury	Brady	and	Chairman	Greenspan	and	the	chairman	of	the	SEC	and	others	have	been	in	close	contact	.
I	'm	sure	0	they	'll	do	what	*T*-1	's	right	,	what	*T*-2	's	prudent	,	what	*T*-3	's	sensible	,	''	he	said	*T*-4	.
When	it	was	suggested	*-1	0	his	comment	was	a	``	non-answer	*T*-2	,	''	Mr.	Darman	replied	:	``	It	is	a	non-answer	.
But	,	in	this	context	,	that	's	the	smart	thing	0	*	to	do	*T*-1	.	''
At	the	Treasury	,	Secretary	Brady	issued	a	statement	minimizing	the	stock	market	's	drop	.
``	Today	's	stock	market	decline	does	n't	signal	any	fundamental	change	in	the	condition	of	the	economy	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
``	The	economy	remains	well-balanced	,	and	the	outlook	is	for	continued	moderate	growth	.	''
But	administration	officials	conceded	that	Friday	's	drop	carried	the	chance	of	further	declines	this	week	.
``	One	possibility	is	that	this	is	a	surgical	setback	,	reasonably	limited	in	its	breadth	,	and	not	a	major	problem	,	''	said	*T*-2	one	senior	administration	official	,	who	also	*T*-3	asked	that	he	not	be	named	*-1	.
``	The	other	is	that	we	see	another	major	disaster	,	like	two	years	ago	.
I	think	0	that	's	less	likely	.	''
Nevertheless	,	Fed	Chairman	Greenspan	and	Vice	Chairman	Manuel	Johnson	were	in	their	offices	Sunday	evening	,	*	monitoring	events	as	they	unfolded	in	markets	around	the	world	.
The	action	was	expected	*-1	to	begin	with	the	opening	of	the	New	Zealand	foreign	exchange	markets	at	5	p.m.	EST	--	when	stocks	there	plunged	*T*-2	--	and	to	continue	as	the	trading	day	began	later	in	the	evening	in	Tokyo	and	through	early	this	morning	in	Europe	.
Both	the	Treasury	and	the	Fed	planned	*-1	to	keep	market	rooms	operating	throughout	the	night	*	to	monitor	the	developments	.
In	Tokyo	,	share	prices	dropped	sharply	by	1.7	%	in	early	Monday	morning	trading	.
After	the	initial	slide	,	the	market	appeared	*-1	to	be	turning	around	but	by	early	afternoon	was	headed	lower	.
In	the	Bush	administration	,	the	lead	is	being	taken	*-1	by	Treasury	Secretary	Brady	,	Undersecretary	Robert	Glauber	and	Assistant	Secretary	Mullins	.
The	three	men	worked	together	on	the	so-called	Brady	Commission	,	headed	*	by	Mr.	Brady	,	which	*T*-2	was	established	*-1	after	the	1987	crash	*	to	examine	the	market	's	collapse	.
As	a	result	they	have	extensive	knowledge	in	financial	markets	,	and	financial	market	crises	.
Mr.	Brady	was	at	the	White	House	Friday	afternoon	when	the	stock	market	's	decline	began	*T*-1	.
He	was	quickly	on	the	phone	with	Mr.	Mullins	,	who	in	turn	*T*-3	was	talking	with	the	chairmen	of	the	New	York	and	Chicago	exchanges	.
Later	,	Mr.	Brady	phoned	Mr.	Greenspan	,	SEC	Chairman	Richard	Breeden	and	numerous	contacts	in	New	York	and	overseas	.
Aides	say	0	he	continued	*-4	to	work	the	phones	through	the	weekend	.
Administration	officials	say	0	President	Bush	was	briefed	*-1	throughout	Friday	afternoon	and	evening	,	even	after	*	leaving	for	Camp	David	.
He	had	frequent	telephone	consultations	with	Mr.	Brady	and	Michael	Boskin	,	chairman	of	the	counsel	of	economic	advisers	.
Government	officials	tried	throughout	the	weekend	*-5	to	render	a	business-as-usual	appearance	in	order	*-5	to	avoid	any	sense	of	panic	.
Treasury	Undersecretary	David	Mulford	,	for	instance	,	was	at	a	meeting	of	the	Business	Council	in	Hot	Springs	,	Va.	,	when	the	stock	market	fell	*T*-6	,	and	remained	there	through	the	following	day	.
And	as	of	last	night	,	Fed	Chairman	Greenspan	had	n't	canceled	his	plans	*	to	address	the	American	Bankers	Association	convention	in	Washington	at	10	a.m.	this	morning	.
Ironically	,	Mr.	Greenspan	was	scheduled	*-7	to	address	the	same	convention	in	Dallas	on	Oct.	20	,	1987	.
He	flew	to	Dallas	on	Oct.	19	,	when	the	market	plummeted	508	points	*T*-8	,	but	then	turned	around	the	next	morning	and	returned	to	Washington	without	*-9	delivering	his	speech	.
Following	is	*T*-1	a	weekly	listing	of	unadited	net	asset	values	of	publicly	traded	investment	fund	shares	,	reported	*	by	the	companies	as	of	Friday	's	close	.
Also	shown	*-2	is	*T*-1	the	closing	listed	market	price	or	a	dealer-to-dealer	asked	price	of	each	fund	's	shares	,	with	the	percentage	of	difference	.

c	-	*	Translated	at	Commercial	Rand	exchange	rate	.

g	-	10.06.89	NAV:22.15	.
z	-	Not	available	.
*	Put	down	that	phone	.
*	Walk	around	the	room	;	*	take	two	deep	breaths	.
*	Resist	the	urge	*	to	call	your	broker	and	sell	all	your	stocks	.
That	's	the	advice	of	most	investment	professionals	after	Friday	's	190-point	drop	in	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	.
No	one	can	say	for	sure	what	*T*-1	will	happen	today	.
And	investment	pros	are	divided	on	whether	stocks	will	perform	well	or	badly	in	the	next	six	months	.
But	they	're	nearly	unanimous	on	one	point	:	*	Do	n't	sell	into	a	panic	.
Investors	who	*T*-1	sold	everything	after	the	crash	of	1987	lived	*-2	to	regret	it	.
Even	after	Friday	's	plunge	,	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	was	48	%	above	where	it	landed	on	Oct.	19	two	years	ago	*T*-1	.
Panic	selling	also	was	unwise	during	other	big	declines	in	the	past	.
The	crash	of	1929	was	followed	*-1	by	a	substantial	recovery	before	the	great	Depression	and	awful	bear	market	of	the	1930s	began	.
The	``	October	massacres	''	of	1978	and	1979	were	scary	,	but	did	n't	lead	to	severe	or	sustained	downturns	.
Indeed	,	some	pros	see	Friday	's	plunge	,	plus	any	further	damage	that	*T*-1	might	occur	early	this	week	,	as	a	chance	for	bargain	hunting	.
``	There	has	been	a	lot	of	emotional	selling	that	*T*-1	presents	a	nice	buying	opportunity	if	you	've	got	the	cash	,	''	says	*T*-2	Stephen	B.	Timbers	,	chief	investment	officer	of	Chicago-based	Kemper	Financial	Services	Inc	.
But	most	advisers	think	0	the	immediate	course	for	individual	investors	should	be	*	to	stand	*-1	pat	.
``	When	you	see	a	runaway	train	,	''	says	*T*-1	Steve	Janachowski	,	partner	in	the	San	Francisco	investment	advisory	firm	Brouwer	&	Janachowski	,	``	you	wait	for	the	train	to	stop	.	''
Even	for	people	who	*T*-1	expect	a	bear	market	in	coming	months	--	and	a	sizable	number	of	money	managers	and	market	pundits	do	*?*	--	the	advice	is	:	*	Wait	for	the	market	to	bounce	back	,	and	sell	shares	gradually	during	rallies	.
The	best	thing	0	individual	investors	can	do	*T*-2	is	*	``	just	sit	tight	,	''	says	*T*-3	Marshall	B.	Front	,	executive	vice	president	and	head	of	investment	counseling	at	Stein	Roe	&	Farnham	Inc.	,	a	Chicago-based	investment	counseling	firm	that	*T*-1	manages	about	$	18	billion	*U*	.
On	the	one	hand	,	Mr.	Front	says	0	*T*-2	,	it	*EXP*-1	would	be	misguided	*	to	sell	into	``	a	classic	panic	.	''
On	the	other	hand	,	it	's	not	necessarily	a	good	time	0	*	to	jump	in	and	buy	*T*-1	.
``	This	is	all	emotion	right	now	,	and	when	emotion	starts	*-2	to	run	*T*-1	,	it	can	run	further	than	anyone	anticipates	,	''	he	said	*T*-3	.
``	So	it	*EXP*-1	's	more	prudent	*	to	wait	and	see	how	things	stabilize	*T*-2	.	''
Roger	Ibbotson	,	professor	of	finance	at	Yale	University	and	head	of	the	market	information	firm	Ibbotson	Associates	Inc.	,	says	,	``	My	real	advice	would	be	*	to	just	ride	through	it	.
Generally	,	it	is	n't	wise	*	to	be	in	*RNR*-1	and	out	''	of	*RNR*-1	the	stock	market	.
Mr.	Ibbotson	thinks	that	this	week	is	``	going	*-1	to	be	a	roller-coaster	week	.	''
But	he	also	thinks	0	it	is	``	a	good	week	0	*	to	consider	*-2	buying	*T*-1	.	''
John	Snyder	,	former	president	of	the	Los	Angeles	chapter	of	the	National	Association	of	Investors	Corp.	,	an	organization	of	investment	clubs	and	individual	investors	,	says	0	his	fellow	club	members	did	n't	sell	in	the	crash	of	1987	,	and	see	no	reason	0	*	to	sell	now	*T*-1	.
``	We	're	dedicated	long-term	investors	,	not	traders	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	We	understand	panics	and	euphoria	.
And	we	hope	*-1	to	take	advantage	of	panics	and	buy	stocks	when	they	plunge	*T*-2	.	''
One	camp	of	investment	pros	sees	what	*T*-1	happened	Friday	as	an	opportunity	.
Over	the	next	days	and	weeks	,	they	say	0	*T*-1	,	investors	should	look	for	stocks	0	*	to	buy	*T*-2	.
Friday	's	action	``	was	an	old-fashioned	panic	,	''	says	0	*T*-1	Alfred	Goldman	,	director	of	technical	market	analysis	for	A.G.	Edwards	&	Sons	in	St.	Louis	.
``	Stocks	were	being	thrown	*-1	out	of	windows	at	any	price	.	''
His	advice	:	``	You	ought	*-1	to	be	there	with	a	basket	*	catching	them	.	''
James	Craig	,	portfolio	manager	for	the	Denver-based	Janus	Fund	,	which	*T*-1	has	one	of	the	industry	's	better	track	records	,	started	his	buying	during	Friday	's	plunge	.
Stocks	such	as	Hershey	Foods	Corp.	,	Wal-Mart	Stores	Inc.	,	American	International	Group	Inc.	and	Federal	National	Mortgage	Association	became	such	bargains	that	he	could	n't	resist	them	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	.
And	Mr.	Craig	expects	*-1	to	pick	up	more	shares	today	.
``	It	will	be	chaotic	at	first	,	but	I	would	not	be	buying	if	I	thought	0	we	were	headed	*-1	for	real	trouble	,	''	he	says	*T*-2	.
He	argues	that	stocks	are	reasonably	valued	*-1	now	,	and	that	interest	rates	are	lower	*ICH*-2	now	than	in	the	fall	of	1987	.
Mr.	Front	of	Stein	Roe	suggests	that	any	buying	should	``	concentrate	in	stocks	that	*T*-2	have	lagged	the	market	on	the	up	side	,	or	stocks	that	*T*-3	have	been	beaten	*-1	down	a	lot	more	than	the	market	in	this	correction	.	''
His	firm	favors	selected	computer	,	drug	and	pollution-control	stocks	.
Other	investment	pros	are	more	pessimistic	.
They	say	0	investors	should	sell	stocks	--	but	not	necessarily	right	away	.
Many	of	them	stress	that	the	selling	can	be	orderly	,	gradual	,	and	done	when	stock	prices	are	rallying	*T*-1	.
On	Thursday	,	William	Fleckenstein	,	a	Seattle	money	manager	,	used	futures	contracts	in	his	personal	account	*-1	to	place	a	bet	that	the	broad	market	averages	would	decline	.
He	thinks	0	the	underlying	inflation	rate	is	around	5	%	to	6	%	*U*	,	far	higher	than	most	people	suppose	.
In	the	pension	accounts	0	he	manages	*T*-1	,	Mr.	Fleckenstein	has	raised	cash	positions	and	invested	in	gold	*RNR*-2	and	natural	gas	*RNR*-2	stocks	,	partly	as	an	inflation	hedge	.
He	thinks	0	government	officials	are	terrified	*	to	let	a	recession	start	when	government	,	corporate	and	personal	debt	levels	are	so	high	*T*-1	.
So	he	thinks	0	the	government	will	err	on	the	side	of	rekindled	inflation	.
As	a	result	,	Mr.	Fleckenstein	says	0	*T*-1	,	``	I	think	0	the	ball	game	's	over	,	''	and	investors	are	about	*-2	to	face	a	bear	market	.
David	M.	Jones	,	vice	president	at	Aubrey	G.	Lanston	&	Co.	,	recommends	Treasury	securities	-LRB-	of	up	to	five	years	'	maturity	-RRB-	.
He	says	0	the	Oct.	6	employment	report	,	showing	slower	economic	growth	and	a	severe	weakening	in	the	manufacturing	sector	,	is	a	warning	sign	to	investors	.
One	strategy	for	investors	who	*T*-1	want	*-3	to	stay	in	but	hedge	their	bets	is	*	to	buy	``	put	''	options	,	either	on	the	individual	stocks	0	they	own	*T*-2	or	on	a	broad	market	index	.
A	put	option	gives	its	holder	the	right	-LRB-	but	not	the	obligation	-RRB-	*	to	sell	a	stock	-LRB-	or	stock	index	-RRB-	for	a	specified	price	-LRB-	the	strike	price	-RRB-	until	the	option	expires	.
Whether	this	insurance	is	worthwhile	depends	on	the	cost	of	an	option	.
The	cost	,	or	premium	,	tends	*	to	get	fat	in	times	of	crisis	.
Thus	,	*	buying	puts	after	a	big	market	slide	can	be	an	expensive	way	0	*	to	hedge	against	risk	*T*-1	.
The	prices	of	puts	generally	did	n't	soar	Friday	.
For	example	,	the	premium	as	a	percentage	of	the	stock	price	for	certain	puts	on	Eli	Lilly	&	Co.	moved	up	from	3	%	at	Thursday	's	close	to	only	3.3	%	at	Friday	's	close	,	even	though	the	shares	dropped	more	than	$	5.50	*U*	.
But	put-option	prices	may	zoom	when	trading	resumes	today	*T*-1	.
It	*EXP*-2	's	hard	*	to	generalize	about	a	reasonable	price	for	puts	.
But	investors	should	keep	in	mind	,	before	*	paying	too	much	,	that	the	average	annual	return	for	stock	holdings	,	long-term	,	is	9	%	to	10	%	*U*	a	year	;	a	return	of	15	%	is	considered	*-1	praiseworthy	.
*	Paying	,	say	,	10	%	for	insurance	against	losses	takes	a	deep	bite	out	of	the	return	.

Coldwell	Banker	Commercial	Group	said	0	it	sold	$	47	million	*U*	of	common	stock	to	its	employees	at	$	10	*U*	a	share	,	*	giving	them	a	total	stake	of	more	than	40	%	in	the	commercial	real	estate	brokerage	firm	.
The	firm	,	which	*T*-2	was	acquired	*-1	in	April	from	Sears	,	Roebuck	&	Co.	in	a	management-led	buy-out	,	had	planned	*-3	to	sell	up	to	$	56.4	million	*U*	of	stock	,	or	a	50	%	stake	in	the	company	,	to	its	5,000	employees	.
Though	the	offering	did	n't	sell	out	,	James	J.	Didion	,	chairman	and	chief	executive	officer	,	said	,	``	We	're	pretty	proud	of	the	employees	'	response	.	''
He	noted	that	unlike	an	employee	stock	ownership	plan	,	where	a	company	usually	borrows	money	from	third	party	lenders	*	to	buy	stock	that	it	sets	*T*-1	aside	*	to	award	employees	over	time	*T*-2	,	here	employees	had	*-3	to	fork	out	their	own	cash	for	the	stock	.
``	They	came	up	with	their	own	money	instead	of	borrowed	money	,	''	Mr.	Didion	said	*T*-1	.
``	It	's	totally	different	.	''
He	said	0	the	offering	was	designed	*-1	to	create	long-term	incentives	for	employees	.
``	We	're	in	a	service	business	,	and	in	that	context	,	it	*EXP*-1	's	vital	*	to	have	your	employees	involved	in	the	ownership	so	they	have	a	stake	in	the	success	.	''
The	brokerage	firm	wo	n't	pay	a	dividend	on	the	stock	.
Employees	have	the	right	*	to	trade	stock	among	themselves	,	and	the	company	will	establish	an	internal	clearing	house	for	these	transactions	.
They	may	also	eventually	sell	the	shares	to	third	parties	,	but	the	outside	investors	who	*T*-1	own	the	remaining	60	%	of	Coldwell	Banker	have	the	right	to	first	refusal	.
Those	outside	investors	in	Coldwell	Banker	include	Carlyle	Group	,	a	closely	held	Washington	,	D.C.	,	merchant	banking	firm	whose	co-chairman	*T*-1	is	Frank	Carlucci	,	former	secretary	of	defense	;	Frederic	V.	Malek	,	senior	adviser	to	Carlyle	Group	;	Mellon	Family	Trust	of	Pittsburgh	;	Westinghouse	Credit	Corp.	,	the	financial	services	unit	of	Westinghouse	Electric	Corp.	;	Bankers	Trust	Co.	,	a	unit	of	Bankers	Trust	New	York	Corp.	;	and	a	group	of	Japanese	investors	represented	*	by	the	investment	banking	unit	of	Tokyo-based	Sumitomo	Bank	.
Bankers	Trust	and	Sumitomo	financed	the	$	300	million	*U*	acquisition	from	Sears	Roebuck	.
Coldwell	Banker	also	named	three	outside	director	nominees	for	its	17	member	board	.
The	nominees	are	Gary	Wilson	,	chief	financial	officer	of	Walt	Disney	Co.	;	James	Montgomery	,	chief	executive	officer	of	Great	Western	Financial	Corp.	;	and	Peter	Ubberroth	,	former	commissioner	of	baseball	and	now	a	private	investor	.
The	first	major	event	this	morning	in	U.S.	stock	and	futures	trading	may	be	a	pause	at	the	Chicago	Mercantile	Exchange	.
Under	a	reform	arising	from	the	1987	crash	,	trading	in	the	Merc	's	stock-index	futures	will	break	for	10	minutes	if	the	contract	opens	and	stays	five	points	from	Friday	's	close	,	a	move	equal	to	40	points	on	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	.
The	aim	of	the	interruption	would	be	*	to	ease	the	opening	of	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	,	which	*T*-2	would	be	hammered	*-1	by	such	a	volatile	move	on	the	Merc	.
That	early-morning	breather	is	just	one	of	a	number	of	safeguards	adopted	*	after	the	1987	crash	.
The	Big	Board	also	added	computer	capacity	*	to	handle	huge	surges	in	trading	volume	.
Several	of	those	post-crash	changes	kicked	in	during	Friday	's	one-hour	collapse	and	worked	as	*	expected	,	even	though	they	did	n't	prevent	a	stunning	plunge	.
But	the	major	``	circuit	breakers	''	have	yet	*	to	be	evaluated	*-1	.
A	deeper	market	plunge	today	could	give	them	their	first	test	.
A	further	slide	also	would	resurrect	debate	over	a	host	of	other	,	more	sweeping	changes	proposed	--	but	not	implemented	--	after	the	last	crash	.
Most	notably	,	several	of	the	regulatory	steps	recommended	*	by	the	Brady	Task	Force	,	which	*T*-2	analyzed	the	1987	crash	,	would	be	revived	*-1	--	especially	because	that	group	's	chairman	is	now	the	Treasury	secretary	.
The	most	controversial	of	the	Brady	recommendations	involved	*	establishing	a	single	overarching	regulator	*	to	handle	crucial	cross-market	questions	,	such	as	*	setting	consistent	margin	requirements	for	the	stock	and	futures	markets	.
But	for	the	moment	,	attention	focuses	on	the	reforms	that	*T*-2	were	put	*-1	into	place	,	and	market	regulators	and	participants	said	0	the	circuit	breakers	worked	as	*	intended	.
Big	Board	and	Merc	officials	expressed	satisfaction	with	the	results	of	two	limits	imposed	*	on	of	the	Merc	's	Standard	&	Poor	's	500	contract	,	as	well	as	``	hot-line	''	communications	among	exchanges	.
Those	pauses	--	from	2:07	p.m.	to	2:30	p.m.	CDT	and	from	2:45	p.m.	until	the	close	of	trading	a	half-hour	later	--	forced	traders	to	buy	and	sell	contracts	at	prices	at	*RNR*-1	or	higher	than	*RNR*-1	their	frozen	levels	.
During	the	first	halt	,	after	the	S&P	index	had	fallen	12	points	,	the	Big	Board	's	``	Sidecar	''	computer	program	automatically	was	triggered	*-1	.
That	system	is	designed	*-1	*	to	separate	computer-generated	program	trades	from	all	other	trades	*	to	help	exchange	officials	resolve	order	imbalances	in	individual	stocks	.
One	Merc	broker	compared	the	action	in	the	S&P	pit	during	the	two	freezes	to	a	fire	at	a	well-drilled	school	.
``	You	do	n't	want	the	fire	but	you	know	what	*	to	do	*T*-1	,	''	said	*T*-2	Howard	Dubnow	,	an	independent	floor	broker	and	a	Merc	governor	.
``	There	was	no	panic	.
The	system	worked	the	way	0	we	devised	it	to	work	*T*-1	.	''
After	*	reopening	for	about	15	minutes	,	the	S&P	index	tumbled	to	its	30-point	limit	and	the	second	freeze	went	into	effect	.
Traders	then	spent	the	last	half-hour	*	``	watching	*	to	see	if	the	Dow	would	drop	250	points	,	''	Mr.	Dubnow	added	0	*T*-2	,	*	referring	to	the	level	at	which	the	stock	market	itself	would	have	closed	for	an	hour	*T*-1	.
One	observer	estimated	that	80	%	to	90	%	*U*	of	the	S&P	traders	``	were	just	standing	around	*-1	watching	.	''
But	the	250-point	circuit	breaker	never	had	*-2	to	kick	in	,	and	freezes	on	the	Chicago	Board	of	Trade	's	Major	Market	Index	also	were	n't	triggered	*-1	.
The	MMI	and	the	S&P	500	are	the	two	major	indexes	used	*	by	program	traders	*-1	to	run	their	computerized	trading	strategies	.
The	programs	are	considered	by	many	*-1	to	be	a	major	cause	of	the	1987	crash	.
The	process	of	post-crash	reforms	began	with	calls	0	*T*-1	to	remake	the	markets	and	wound	up	a	year	later	with	a	series	of	rather	technical	adjustments	.
In	October	1987	,	just	after	the	market	drop	,	Washington	was	awash	in	talk	of	sweeping	changes	in	the	way	0	the	financial	markets	are	structured	and	regulated	*T*-1	.
Over	the	next	year	that	grand	agenda	was	whittled	*-1	down	to	a	series	of	steps	0	*	to	soften	big	stock	drops	by	*	interrupting	trading	*	to	give	market	players	time	0	*	to	pause	and	reconsider	positions	*T*-3	*T*-2	.
In	addition	,	limits	were	placed	*-1	on	computer-driven	trading	,	and	steps	were	taken	*-2	*	to	better	link	the	stock	and	futures	markets	.
Few	changes	were	made	*-1	in	the	way	0	the	markets	are	regulated	*-2	*T*-3	.
At	the	outset	the	prime	target	was	program	trading	,	which	*T*-1	was	much	discussed	but	little	understood	on	Capitol	Hill	.
There	were	also	calls	0	*	to	strip	the	stock	markets	of	``	derivative	''	products	,	such	as	stock-index	futures	and	options	,	which	Federal	Judge	Stanley	Sporkin	,	for	example	,	likened	*T*-1	to	``	barnacles	attached	to	the	basic	market	*T*-2	.	''
And	there	was	much	criticism	of	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	's	system	of	*	having	stock	trades	flow	through	specialists	,	or	market	makers	.
When	the	Brady	Task	Force	's	powerful	analysis	of	the	crash	was	released	*-1	in	January	1988	*T*-2	,	it	immediately	reshaped	the	reformers	'	agenda	.
*	Arguing	that	the	separate	financial	marketplaces	acted	as	one	,	and	concluding	that	the	crash	had	``	raised	the	possibility	of	a	full-scale	financial	system	breakdown	,	''	the	presidential	task	force	called	for	*	establishing	a	super-regulator	*-1	to	oversee	the	markets	,	*-1	to	make	margins	consistent	across	markets	,	*-1	to	unify	clearing	systems	and	*-1	to	install	circuit	breakers	.
Only	the	last	of	those	recommendations	ever	was	implemented	*-1	.
The	Reagan	White	House	held	the	Brady	recommendations	at	arm	's	length	and	named	a	second	panel	--	the	Working	Group	on	the	Financial	Markets	--	to	review	its	analysis	and	those	of	other	crash	studies	.
In	May	1988	,	the	Working	Group	,	made	up	of	representatives	from	the	Federal	Reserve	,	the	Treasury	,	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	,	and	the	Commodity	Futures	Trading	Commission	,	finally	endorsed	only	circuit	breakers	.
After	several	more	months	of	arguments	among	various	stock	exchanges	and	futures	markets	,	circuit	breakers	were	set	*-1	in	place	,	with	the	most	notable	suspending	trading	after	250	and	400	point	drops	in	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	.
Privately	,	some	free	marketeers	dismissed	such	mechanisms	as	sops	to	interventionists	.
After	all	,	this	free-market	argument	went	0	*T*-1	,	the	Dow	only	dropped	more	than	250	points	once	this	century	.
``	Circuit	breakers	''	set	*	*	to	soften	big	drops	:
--	If	S&P	futures	fall	5	points	at	opening	,	contract	trading	pauses	for	10	minutes	.
--	If	Dow	Industrials	fall	25	points	at	opening	,	contract	trading	pauses	for	10	minutes	.
--	If	S&P	futures	fall	12	points	-LRB-	equivalent	to	about	100	points	on	DJIA	-RRB-	,	trading	is	frozen	*-1	for	half	hour	to	that	price	or	higher	.
On	NYSE	program	trades	are	diverted	*-1	into	a	separate	computer	file	*	to	determine	buy	and	sell	orders	.
--	If	S&P	futures	fall	30	points	,	trading	is	restricted	*-1	for	an	hour	to	that	price	or	higher	.
--	If	Dow	Industrials	fall	250	points	,	trading	on	the	Big	Board	halts	for	an	hour	.
S&P	and	MMI	contracts	also	halt	.
--	If	DJIA	drops	400	points	,	Big	Board	halts	trading	for	two	hours	.
Trading	in	MMI	and	S&P	futures	also	halted	.
Brady	Task	Force	recommendations	-LRB-	Jan.	1988	-RRB-	:
--	*	Establish	an	overarching	regulator	for	financial	markets
--	*	Unify	trade-clearing	systems
--	*	Make	margins	consistent	across	stock	and	futures	markets
SEC	proposals	-LRB-	May	1988	-RRB-	:
--	*	Require	prompt	reports	of	large	securities	trades	.
--	*	Give	SEC	authority	*	to	monitor	risk-taking	by	affiliates	of	brokerage	firms	.
--	*	Transfer	jurisdiction	over	stock-related	futures	to	SEC	from	CFTC	.
-LRB-	*	Opposed	*-1	by	new	SEC	chairman	-RRB-
--	*	Give	SEC	authority	*	to	halt	securities	trading	,	-LRB-	*	also	opposed	*-1	by	new	SEC	chairman	-RRB-	.
Congressional	proposal	:

*-1	Breaking	the	Soviet	government	's	television	monopoly	,	an	independent	company	has	gained	rights	*	to	show	world	programming	,	including	American	films	.
``	There	must	not	be	a	monopoly	,	there	must	be	freedom	of	choice	for	both	journalists	and	viewers	,	''	Nikolai	I.	Lutsenko	,	the	president	of	the	Nika	TV	company	,	told	the	weekly	newspaper	Nedelya	*T*-1	.
The	company	is	already	working	on	its	own	programming	in	several	provincial	cities	and	hopes	*-1	to	be	on	the	air	regularly	in	about	a	year	,	the	newspaper	said	0	*T*-2	.
Mr.	Lutsenko	told	Nedelya	that	he	recently	had	been	to	the	U.S.	*	to	pick	up	the	rights	*	to	show	5,000	U.S.	films	in	the	Soviet	Union	.
Nedelya	's	article	was	accompanied	*-1	by	a	picture	of	Mr.	Lutsenko	interviewing	singer	John	Denver	in	Colorado	.
Even	though	it	will	be	independent	of	official	television	,	Nika	will	have	an	oversight	board	that	*T*-1	will	include	members	of	the	Communist	youth	league	.
South	Africa	's	National	Union	of	Mineworkers	said	that	about	10,000	diamond	miners	struck	for	higher	wages	at	De	Beers	Consolidated	Mines	Ltd.
De	Beers	said	that	workers	at	five	of	the	group	's	mines	were	on	strike	,	which	it	said	0	*T*-1	was	peaceful	,	with	orderly	picketing	occurring	at	one	of	the	mines	.
The	deadlock	in	negotiations	occurred	with	De	Beers	offering	a	17	%	increase	in	the	minimum-wage	category	while	the	union	demanded	a	37.6	%	increase	in	the	minimum	wage	.
Japan	's	opposition	Socialist	Party	denied	that	its	legislators	had	been	bribed	*-1	by	pinball-parlor	owners	.
The	allegation	had	been	raised	*-1	in	Parliament	by	the	governing	Liberal	Democratic	Party	following	magazine	reports	suggesting	that	money	from	Japanese-style	pinball	,	called	*	pachinko	,	had	infiltrated	politics	.
Tsuruo	Yamaguchi	,	secretary	general	of	the	Socialist	Party	,	acknowledged	that	nine	party	lawmakers	had	received	donations	from	the	pachinko	association	totaling	8	million	yen	-LRB-	about	$	55,000	*U*	-RRB-	but	said	0	the	donations	were	legal	and	none	of	its	members	acted	*-1	to	favor	the	industry	.
The	World	Wide	Fund	for	Nature	said	that	Spain	,	Argentina	,	Thailand	and	Indonesia	were	doing	too	little	0	*T*-1	to	prevent	illegal	trade	in	endangered	wildlife	across	their	borders	.
A	report	by	the	conservation	group	presented	*	at	the	U.N.-sponsored	Convention	on	International	Trade	in	Endangered	Species	in	Lausanne	accused	the	four	of	*-1	trading	protected	species	ranging	from	parakeets	to	orchids	.
Fund	official	Simon	Lyster	said	0	world	trade	in	wildlife	was	estimated	*-1	to	total	$	5	billion	*U*	of	business	annually	.
A	NATO	project	0	*T*-2	to	build	a	frigate	for	the	1990s	was	torpedoed	*-1	by	the	pull-out	of	three	of	its	eight	participating	nations	.
Britain	,	France	and	Italy	announced	technical	reasons	for	withdrawing	,	but	some	officials	pointed	to	growing	reluctance	*ICH*-1	among	the	allies	*	to	commit	themselves	to	big	defense	spending	while	East-West	disarmament	talks	show	signs	of	success	.
Small	wonder	that	Britain	's	Labor	Party	wants	credit	controls	.
A	few	hours	after	the	party	launched	its	own	affinity	credit	card	earlier	this	month	,	the	Tories	raised	the	nation	's	base	interest	rate	.
Labor	's	Visa	card	is	believed	*-1	to	be	the	first	linked	*	to	a	British	political	party	.
Labor	gets	25	pence	-LRB-	39	cents	-RRB-	for	every	100	-LRB-	about	$	155	*U*	-RRB-	that	a	user	charges	*T*-1	to	the	card	.
As	with	other	plastic	in	Britain	's	high-interest-rate	environment	,	the	Labor	card	,	administered	*	by	Co-operative	Bank	,	carries	a	stiff	-LRB-	in	this	case	,	29.8	%	-RRB-	annual	rate	on	the	unpaid	balance	.
China	's	year-long	austerity	program	has	achieved	some	successes	in	*	harnessing	runaway	economic	growth	and	stabilizing	prices	but	has	failed	*-1	to	eliminate	serious	defects	in	state	planning	and	an	alarming	drain	on	state	budgets	.
The	official	China	Daily	said	0	retail	prices	of	non-staple	foods	have	n't	risen	since	last	December	but	acknowledged	0	that	huge	government	subsidies	were	a	main	factor	in	*	keeping	prices	down	.
The	State	Statistical	Bureau	found	that	more	than	1	billion	yuan	-LRB-	$	270	million	*U*	-RRB-	was	spent	*-1	in	the	first	half	of	the	year	for	pork	subsidies	.
The	newspaper	quoted	experts	as	*-1	saying	0	the	subsidies	would	cause	the	difference	between	prices	and	real	values	of	commodities	to	``	become	very	unreasonable	''	and	reduce	needed	funds	for	investment	in	the	``	already	difficult	state	budget	.	''
The	aim	of	the	austerity	measures	was	*	to	slice	economic	growth	,	which	*T*-1	soared	to	20.7	%	last	year	,	to	8	%	in	1990	.
Economists	now	predict	0	the	growth	rate	will	be	about	11.5	%	for	the	year	.
In	a	sign	of	growing	official	tolerance	for	religion	,	Russian	Orthodox	priests	were	allowed	*-2	to	celebrate	the	400th	anniversary	of	the	Moscow	patriarchate	in	the	Kremlin	's	15th-century	Uspensky	Cathedral	,	where	czars	were	crowned	*-1	*T*-3	...	.
A	34-foot-tall	,	$	7.7	million	*U*	statue	of	Buddha	was	completed	*-1	on	a	hill	outside	Hong	Kong	,	facing	China	.
The	statue	is	the	brainchild	of	Sik	Chi	Wan	,	director	of	the	Po	Lin	Monastery	,	who	*T*-1	said	:	``	Hong	Kong	is	such	a	prosperous	place	,	0	we	also	need	some	kind	of	religious	symbol	.
It	all	seemed	innocent	enough	:	Last	April	,	one	Steven	B.	Iken	visited	Justin	Products	Inc.	here	,	identified	himself	as	a	potential	customer	and	got	the	word	on	the	little	company	's	new	cassette	players	for	children	.
``	It	is	almost	identical	to	the	Sony	product	,	''	Mr.	Iken	remarked	*T*-1	,	after	*-2	seeing	prototypes	and	pictures	.
Replied	a	Justin	salesman	:	``	Exactly	.	''
The	Justin	merchandise	carried	wholesale	prices	some	40	%	below	those	of	Sony	Corp.	of	Japan	's	``	My	First	Sony	''	line	.
The	visitor	waxed	*	enthusiastic	and	promised	*-1	to	return	.
But	instead	of	a	new	customer	--	part	of	a	hoped-for	bonanza	from	*	underselling	Sony	--	Justin	got	a	costly	legal	morass	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Iken	,	it	turned	out	*T*-1	,	was	a	private	detective	using	a	hidden	tape	recorder	*-2	to	gather	information	for	Sony	.
His	recording	later	turned	up	as	a	court	exhibit	.
*-2	Seeking	*-1	to	keep	Justin	's	``	My	Own	''	product	line	off	the	U.S.	market	,	Sony	last	May	filed	a	suit	*ICH*-3	in	Manhattan	federal	court	accusing	the	upstart	of	trademark	infringement	,	unfair	competition	and	other	violations	of	business	law	.
Since	then	,	life	has	changed	a	lot	for	61-year-old	Leonard	Kaye	,	Justin	's	owner	.
``	I	have	n't	been	able	*	to	get	a	decent	night	's	sleep	since	this	has	been	going	on	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	It	's	the	most	distracting	thing	in	my	life	--	I	ca	n't	even	attend	to	my	business	.	''
His	company	-LRB-	annual	sales	:	about	$	25	million	*U*	-RRB-	may	suffer	a	costly	blow	--	*	losing	an	estimated	10	%	of	total	sales	--	if	Sony	-LRB-	annual	sales	:	about	$	16	billion	*U*	-RRB-	prevails	.
Justin	's	plight	shows	what	*T*-1	can	happen	when	a	tiny	company	suddenly	faces	the	full	legal	might	of	a	wrathful	multinational	.
With	considerable	irony	,	the	case	also	shows	how	completely	Japan	has	turned	the	tables	on	U.S.	business	*T*-1	.
Americans	used	*-1	to	complain	bitterly	about	*-1	being	undersold	by	look-alike	products	from	Japan	.
Now	Sony	,	whose	innovative	,	premium-priced	products	*T*-1	are	among	the	most	admired	in	consumer	electronics	,	is	bitterly	complaining	about	a	little	U.S.	firm	with	a	cheap	look-alike	produced	*	in	China	.
``	The	gist	of	this	is	that	Justin	knocked	off	the	Sony	line	and	Sony	wants	*-3	to	stop	it	,	''	says	*T*-2	Lewis	H.	Eslinger	,	Sony	's	attorney	,	who	*T*-1	previously	guarded	Rubik	's	Cube	.
-LRB-	Sony	itself	declines	*-1	to	comment	.	-RRB-
If	Sony	wins	,	Mr.	Eslinger	says	,	its	little	rival	will	have	*-1	to	try	*-2	to	sell	the	products	overseas	.
At	worst	,	he	adds	*T*-1	,	``	They	'd	have	*-2	to	grind	them	all	up	and	throw	them	away	.	''
Mr.	Kaye	denies	the	suit	's	charges	and	says	0	his	only	mistake	was	*	taking	on	Sony	in	the	marketplace	.
``	I	made	a	similar	line	and	I	produced	it	cheaper	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
Today	,	U.S.	Judge	John	E.	Sprizzo	is	expected	*-1	to	rule	on	Sony	's	renewed	request	for	a	pre-trial	order	blocking	sale	of	the	disputed	products	,	on	which	deliveries	began	in	July	*T*-2	.
The	judge	turned	down	an	earlier	Sony	request	for	such	an	order	--	a	decision	upheld	*	on	appeal	--	but	Sony	returned	with	additional	evidence	and	arguments	.
Though	*-1	hoping	*-2	to	settle	the	case	,	Justin	vows	*-1	to	fight	on	,	if	necessary	.
But	the	battle	is	more	than	Justin	bargained	for	*?*	.
``	I	had	no	idea	0	I	was	getting	in	so	deep	,	''	says	*T*-2	Mr.	Kaye	,	who	*T*-1	founded	Justin	in	1982	.
Mr.	Kaye	had	sold	Capetronic	Inc.	,	a	Taiwan	electronics	maker	,	and	retired	,	only	*	to	find	0	he	was	bored	.
With	Justin	,	he	began	*-1	selling	toys	and	electronics	made	*	mostly	in	Hong	Kong	,	*	beginning	with	Mickey	Mouse	radios	.
The	company	has	grown	--	to	about	40	employees	,	from	four	initially	,	Mr.	Kaye	says	*T*-1	.
Justin	has	been	profitable	since	1986	,	adds	0	*T*-2	the	official	,	who	*T*-1	shares	his	office	with	numerous	teddy	bears	,	all	samples	from	his	line	of	plush	toys	.
Like	many	others	,	Mr.	Kaye	took	notice	in	1987	when	Sony	,	in	a	classic	example	of	market	segmentation	,	changed	the	plastic	skin	and	buttons	on	the	famous	Walkman	line	of	portable	audio	equipment	and	created	the	My	First	Sony	line	for	children	.
The	brightly	colored	new	products	looked	more	like	toys	than	the	adult	models	.
-LRB-	In	court	papers	,	Sony	says	0	it	has	spent	more	than	$	3	million	*U*	*-1	to	promote	the	line	,	with	resulting	sales	of	over	a	million	units	.	-RRB-
Sony	found	a	new	market	niche	,	but	Mr.	Kaye	figured	that	its	prices	left	plenty	of	room	for	a	lower-priced	competitor	.
His	products	are	n't	exact	copies	of	Sony	's	but	strongly	resemble	them	in	size	,	shape	and	,	especially	,	color	.
Sony	uses	mostly	red	and	blue	,	with	traces	of	yellow	--	and	so	does	Justin	,	on	the	theory	that	kids	prefer	these	colors	.
-LRB-	``	*	To	be	successful	,	a	product	can	be	any	color	whatsoever	,	as	long	as	it	is	fire-engine	red	,	''	says	*T*-1	Charles	E.	Baxley	,	Justin	's	attorney	.	-RRB-
By	last	winter	,	Justin	was	showing	prototypes	at	toy	fairs	in	Hong	Kong	and	New	York	--	and	Sony	noticed	.
Indeed	,	*-1	concerned	that	Sony	sales	personnel	were	threatening	legal	action	or	other	retaliation	--	such	as	*	withholding	desirable	Sony	products	--	against	Justin	's	customers	,	Mr.	Baxley	fired	off	a	letter	to	Sony	in	April	.
He	himself	threatened	*-1	to	take	the	matter	to	the	Federal	Trade	Commission	or	U.S.	Justice	Department	.
But	Justin	has	n't	pursued	those	charges	-LRB-	which	*T*-1	were	without	merit	,	according	to	Mr.	Eslinger	,	the	Sony	attorney	-RRB-	.
Recalls	Mr.	Baxley	:	``	Our	purpose	was	*	to	influence	them	to	leave	us	alone	.
We	never	intended	*-1	taking	on	Sony	--	we	do	n't	have	the	resources	.	''
Sony	answered	the	empty	threat	with	its	real	suit	.
Off	and	on	since	then	,	the	companies	have	skirmished	in	court	.
And	Justin	,	in	a	news	release	,	says	,	``	*-1	Once	competitive	,	Sony	now	resorts	to	strong-arm	tactics	in	American	courtrooms	*-1	to	carve	out	*RNR*-2	and	protect	*RNR*-2	niche	markets	.	''
Sony	's	lawyer	insists	that	the	company	's	tactics	--	including	the	use	of	a	private	detective	posing	as	a	buyer	--	are	routine	in	such	matters	.
He	also	insists	that	Sony	,	no	less	than	others	,	has	a	legal	right	*	to	protect	its	``	trade	dress	,	''	in	this	case	,	mostly	the	colors	that	it	claims	0	*T*-1	make	My	First	Sony	products	distinctive	.
-LRB-	Justin	claims	0	it	began	*-1	using	the	same	colors	on	electronic	goods	for	children	long	before	Sony	entered	the	children	's	market	.	-RRB-
Whatever	its	merits	,	Sony	's	aggressive	defense	is	debilitating	for	Justin	.
It	's	also	costly	.
Mr.	Kaye	says	0	he	has	paid	more	than	$	70,000	*U*	in	legal	fees	so	far	.
Of	Sony	,	Mr.	Kaye	says	:	``	They	know	0	there	's	no	way	0	for	them	to	lose	*T*-1	.
They	just	keep	*-1	digging	me	in	deeper	until	I	reach	the	point	where	I	give	up	and	go	away	.	''
For	now	,	though	,	he	vows	*-1	to	hang	in	.

Mr.	Rocha	Garza	said	that	he	,	Clarendon	Group	Ltd.	,	Biscayne	,	Lahus	II	,	and	Lahus	III	are	all	affiliated	and	hold	a	combined	stake	of	1,234,100	shares	,	or	9.33	%	.
Mr.	Rocha	Garza	has	said	0	he	wants	*-1	to	purchase	more	shares	.
In	San	Diego	,	Smith	Laboratories	President	Timothy	Wollaeger	said	0	the	transfer	of	the	shares	is	n't	significant	.
Investcorp	,	New	York	,	said	0	it	and	the	management	of	Sports	&	Recreation	Inc.	bought	the	operator	of	the	10-store	Sports	Unlimited	chain	for	some	$	40	million	*U*	.
The	investment	bank	becomes	majority	shareholder	in	Sports	&	Recreation	,	a	10-year-old	sporting	goods	retailer	,	said	*T*-1	Oliver	E.	Richardson	,	a	member	of	Investcorp	's	management	committee	and	a	director	of	the	chain	.
Sports	Unlimited	,	Tampa	,	Fla.	,	posted	revenue	of	$	59	million	*U*	for	the	year	ended	July	31	.
The	company	is	``	very	profitable	''	on	an	operating	basis	,	Mr.	Richardson	said	0	*T*-1	,	but	he	declined	*-2	to	specify	numbers	.
In	1982	,	Sports	&	Recreation	's	managers	and	certain	passive	investors	purchased	the	company	from	Brunswick	Corp.	of	Skokie	,	Ill	.
In	the	latest	transaction	,	management	bought	out	the	passive	investors	'	holding	,	Mr.	Richardson	said	0	*T*-1	.
Hammond	Co.	,	Newport	Beach	,	Calif.	,	said	0	Fidelity	National	Financial	Inc.	extended	its	previous	agreement	,	under	which	it	wo	n't	purchase	any	more	of	the	mortgage	banker	's	common	stock	*T*-1	,	through	Oct.	31	.
The	previous	agreement	expired	Thursday	.
Hammond	said	that	its	discussions	with	Fidelity	,	an	Irvine	,	Calif.	,	title-insurance	underwriter	,	are	continuing	,	but	that	prospects	for	a	longer-term	standstill	agreement	are	uncertain	.
Fidelity	has	increased	its	stake	in	Hammond	to	23.57	%	in	recent	months	.
Statements	made	*	in	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	filings	led	Hammond	to	request	a	standstill	agreement	.

Giant	,	a	Beverly	Hills	,	Calif.	,	collection	of	companies	that	*T*-3	is	controlled	*-1	by	Hollywood	producer	Burt	Sugarman	,	did	n't	give	a	reason	for	*	halting	its	plan	*	to	acquire	the	airline	,	and	Aspen	officials	could	n't	be	reached	*-2	for	comment	.
Giant	agreed	last	month	*-1	to	purchase	the	carrier	.
Giant	has	n't	ever	disclosed	the	proposed	price	,	although	Avmark	Inc.	,	an	Arlington	,	Va.-based	aircraft	consulting	concern	,	has	valued	Aspen	's	fleet	at	about	$	46	million	*U*	.

Both	Paribas	and	AGF	have	been	increasing	their	stakes	in	Navigation	Mixte	recently	for	what	they	have	termed	*T*-2	``	investment	purposes	,	''	although	the	issue	has	been	surrounded	*-1	by	takeover	speculation	in	recent	weeks	.
AGF	did	n't	comment	officially	on	its	reasons	for	*	seeking	the	approval	,	but	people	close	to	the	group	said	0	it	was	done	*-1	*	to	make	sure	0	the	group	would	have	the	flexibility	0	*	to	increase	its	stake	in	the	future	*T*-2	,	should	interesting	price	opportunities	arise	.

Striking	auto	workers	ended	their	19-day	occupation	of	a	metal	shop	at	a	Peugeot	S.A.	factory	in	eastern	France	Friday	as	pay	talks	got	under	way	in	the	capital	.
But	the	Peugeot	breakthrough	came	as	a	nationwide	dispute	by	Finance	Ministry	employees	disrupted	border	checkpoints	and	threatened	the	government	's	ability	*	to	pay	its	bills	.
The	Peugeot	metalworkers	began	*-2	filing	out	of	the	shop	,	which	*T*-1	makes	auto	parts	,	at	the	plant	in	Mulhouse	after	*	voting	589	to	193	*-3	to	abandon	the	occupation	.

The	strike	by	customs	officers	,	tax	collectors	,	treasury	workers	and	other	civil	servants	attached	*	to	the	Ministry	of	Finance	may	pose	a	more	serious	challenge	to	the	government	and	the	average	Frenchman	.

The	market	for	$	200	billion	*U*	of	high-risk	junk	bonds	,	*-1	battered	*	by	a	succession	of	defaults	and	huge	price	declines	this	year	,	practically	vanished	Friday	.
Trading	ground	to	a	halt	as	investors	rushed	*-1	to	sell	bonds	,	only	*	to	find	themselves	deserted	*-2	by	potential	buyers	.
*-1	Stunned	,	they	watched	brokerage	houses	mark	down	price	quotations	on	their	junk	holdings	while	*	being	able	*	to	execute	very	few	actual	trades	.
``	The	junk	bond	market	is	in	a	state	of	gridlock	now	--	there	are	no	bids	,	only	offers	,	''	says	*T*-3	independent	investor	Martin	D.	Sass	,	who	*T*-1	manages	nearly	$	4	billion	*U*	and	who	*T*-2	recently	decided	*-4	to	buy	distressed	securities	for	a	new	fund	.
This	calamity	is	``	far	from	over	,	''	he	says	0	*T*-1	.
Junk	's	collapse	helped	*-2	stoke	the	panicky	selling	of	stocks	that	*T*-1	produced	the	deepest	one-day	dive	in	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	since	the	Oct.	19	,	1987	,	crash	.
Simultaneously	,	it	also	helped	*-2	trigger	this	year	's	biggest	rally	in	the	U.S.	government	bond	market	as	investors	rushed	*-3	to	move	capital	into	the	highest-quality	securities	0	they	could	find	*T*-1	.
But	``	an	eerie	silence	pervaded	''	the	junk	market	Friday	as	prices	tumbled	on	hundreds	of	high-yield	bonds	despite	``	no	active	trading	,	''	says	*T*-1	John	Lonski	,	an	economist	at	Moody	's	Investors	Service	Inc	.
For	example	,	the	price	of	Southland	Corp.	's	$	500	million	*U*	of	16	3\/4	%	bonds	due	2002	--	sold	less	than	two	years	ago	by	Goldman	,	Sachs	&	Co.	--	plummeted	25	%	to	just	30	cents	on	the	dollar	.
But	not	even	Goldman	would	make	a	market	in	the	securities	of	Southland	,	the	owner	of	the	nationwide	chain	of	7-11	convenience	stores	that	*T*-13	is	strapped	*-12	for	cash	.
Goldman	officials	declined	*-1	to	comment	.
Junk	bonds	,	which	*T*-1	mushroomed	from	less	than	$	2	billion	*U*	at	the	start	of	this	decade	,	have	been	declining	for	months	as	issuer	after	issuer	sank	beneath	the	weight	of	hefty	interest	payments	.
The	shaky	market	received	its	biggest	jolt	last	month	from	Campeau	Corp.	,	which	*T*-1	created	its	U.S.	retailing	empire	with	junk	financing	.
Campeau	developed	a	cash	squeeze	that	*T*-1	caused	it	to	be	tardy	on	some	interest	payments	and	to	put	its	prestigious	Bloomingdales	department-store	chain	up	for	sale	.
Now	,	dozens	of	corporations	,	including	Ethan	Allen	,	TW	Services	and	York	International	,	that	*T*-1	are	counting	on	at	least	$	7	billion	*U*	of	scheduled	new	junk	financings	*-2	to	keep	their	highly	leveraged	takeovers	and	buy-outs	afloat	,	may	never	get	the	money	.
``	The	music	has	stopped	*	playing	,	''	says	*T*-1	Michael	Harkins	,	a	principal	in	the	investment	firm	of	Levy	Harkins	.
``	You	've	either	got	a	chair	or	you	do	n't	*?*	.	''
In	Friday	's	aftermath	,	says	0	*T*-2	R.	Douglas	Carleton	,	a	director	of	high-yield	finance	at	First	Boston	Corp.	,	``	much	of	the	$	7	billion	*U*	forward	calendar	could	be	deferred	*-1	,	depending	on	the	hysteria	.	''
In	August	,	First	Boston	withdrew	a	$	475	million	*U*	junk	offering	of	Ohio	Mattress	bonds	because	potential	buyers	were	``	very	skittish	.	''
The	outlook	``	looks	shaky	because	we	're	still	waiting	''	for	mutual	funds	,	in	particular	,	to	dump	some	of	their	junk	bond	holdings	*	to	pay	off	redemptions	by	individual	investors	,	says	0	*T*-1	King	Penniman	,	senior	vice	president	at	McCarthy	,	Crisanti	&	Maffei	,	an	investment	arm	of	Xerox	Financial	Services	.
Indeed	,	a	Moody	's	index	that	*T*-1	tracks	the	net	asset	values	of	24	high-yield	mutual	funds	declined	for	the	17th	consecutive	day	Friday	.
In	a	stark	contrast	,	the	benchmark	30-year	Treasury	bond	climbed	more	than	2	1\/2	points	,	or	about	$	25	*U*	for	each	$	1,000	*U*	face	amount	,	to	103	12\/32	,	its	biggest	gain	of	the	year	.
The	bond	's	yield	dropped	to	7.82	%	,	the	lowest	since	March	31	,	1987	,	according	to	Technical	Data	Global	Markets	Group	.
The	yield	on	three-month	Treasury	bills	,	considered	the	safest	of	all	investments	,	plummeted	about	0.7	percentage	point	to	7.16	%	,	the	largest	one-day	decline	since	1982	.
The	main	catalyst	for	government	bond	market	rally	was	the	190.58-point	drop	in	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	.
``	When	you	get	panic	in	one	market	*T*-1	,	you	get	flight	to	quality	in	the	other	,	''	said	*T*-2	Maria	Ramirez	,	money	market	economist	at	Drexel	Burnham	Lambert	Inc	.
Nevertheless	,	the	problems	of	the	junk	market	could	prompt	the	Federal	Reserve	to	ease	credit	in	the	months	ahead	.
``	This	marks	a	significant	shift	in	the	interest	rate	outlook	,	''	says	*T*-1	William	Sullivan	,	director	of	money	market	research	at	Dean	Witter	Reynolds	Inc.	,	New	York	.
Any	sustained	credit-easing	could	be	a	lift	for	junk	bonds	as	well	as	other	securities	.
Robert	Dow	,	a	partner	and	portfolio	manager	at	Lord	,	Abbett	&	Co.	,	which	*T*-1	manages	$	4	billion	*U*	of	high-yield	bonds	,	says	0	he	does	n't	``	think	0	there	is	any	fundamental	economic	rationale	-LCB-	for	the	junk	bond	rout	-RCB-	.
It	was	herd	instinct	.	''
He	adds	:	``	The	junk	market	has	witnessed	some	trouble	and	now	some	people	think	that	if	the	equity	market	gets	creamed	*-1	that	means	0	the	economy	will	be	terrible	and	that	's	bad	for	junk	.
I	do	n't	believe	0	that	's	the	case	,	but	I	believe	that	people	are	running	*-1	scared	.
There	is	a	flight	to	quality	,	and	the	quality	is	not	in	equities	and	not	in	junk	--	it	's	in	Treasurys	.	''
Even	as	trading	in	high-yield	issues	dried	up	over	the	past	month	,	corporations	sold	more	than	$	2	billion	*U*	of	new	junk	bonds	.
For	example	,	a	recent	$	375	million	*U*	offering	of	Petrolane	Gas	Services	L.P.	bonds	sold	*	by	First	Boston	was	three	times	oversubscribed	.
A	$	550	million	*U*	offering	of	Turner	Broadcasting	System	Inc	.	high-yield	securities	sold	last	week	by	Drexel	was	increased	*-1	$	50	million	*U*	because	of	strong	demand	.
First	Boston	estimates	that	in	November	and	December	alone	,	junk	bond	investors	will	receive	$	4.8	billion	*U*	of	coupon	interest	payments	.
``	That	's	a	clear	indication	that	there	is	*RNR*-1	and	will	be	*RNR*-1	an	undercurrent	of	basic	business	going	on	,	''	says	*T*-2	Mr.	Carleton	of	First	Boston	.
``	I	do	n't	know	how	people	can	say	0	the	junk	bond	market	disappeared	*T*-3	when	there	were	$	1.5	billion	*U*	of	orders	for	$	550	million	*U*	of	junk	bonds	sold	last	week	by	Turner	*T*-2	,	''	says	*T*-1	Raymond	Minella	,	co-head	of	merchant	banking	at	Merrill	Lynch	&	Co	.
``	When	the	rally	comes	*T*-1	,	insurance	companies	will	be	leading	it	because	they	have	billions	0	*	to	invest	*T*-3	and	invest	they	will	*T*-2	.
There	is	plenty	of	money	available	from	people	who	*T*-1	want	*-3	to	buy	well-structured	deals	;	it	*EXP*-4	's	the	stuff	that	*T*-2	's	financed	on	a	shoestring	that	people	are	wary	of	*T*-5	.	''
But	such	highly	leveraged	transactions	seemed	*-1	to	have	multiplied	this	year	,	*	casting	a	pall	over	much	of	the	junk	market	.
Michael	McNamara	,	director	of	fixed-income	research	at	Kemper	Financial	Services	,	says	0	the	quality	of	junk	issues	has	been	getting	poorer	,	*	contributing	to	the	slide	in	prices	.
``	Last	year	we	probably	bought	one	out	of	every	three	new	deals	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	This	year	,	at	best	,	it	's	in	one	in	every	five	or	six	.
And	our	credit	standards	have	n't	changed	one	iota	.	''
However	,	Mr.	McNamara	said	0	the	slide	in	junk	is	creating	``	one	hell	of	a	buying	opportunity	''	for	selective	buyers	.
For	the	moment	,	investors	seem	more	preoccupied	with	the	``	bad	''	junk	than	the	``	good	''	junk	.
``	The	market	has	been	weak	since	''	the	announcement	of	the	Campeau	cash	squeeze	and	the	company	's	subsequent	bailout	by	Olympia	&	York	,	says	*T*-1	Mr.	Minella	of	Merrill	Lynch	.
``	That	really	affected	the	market	in	that	people	started	*-2	to	ask	`	What	else	*T*-1	is	in	trouble	?	'	''
Well	before	Campeau	,	though	,	there	were	signs	that	the	junk	market	was	stumbling	through	one	of	its	worst	years	ever	.
Despite	the	relatively	strong	economy	,	junk	bond	prices	did	nothing	except	go	down	,	*	hammered	by	a	seemingly	endless	trail	of	bad	news	:
--	In	June	,	two	months	before	it	would	default	on	interest	payments	covering	some	of	its	$	1.2	billion	*U*	of	speculative	debt	securities	,	New	York-based	Integrated	Resources	Inc.	said	0	it	ran	out	of	borrowed	money	.
--	In	July	,	Southmark	Corp.	,	the	Dallas-based	real	estate	and	financial	services	company	with	about	$	1.3	billion	*U*	of	junk	bonds	,	voluntarily	filed	for	protection	under	U.S.	bankruptcy	law	.
--	By	the	end	of	July	,	the	difference	in	yield	between	an	index	of	junk	bonds	and	seven-year	Treasury	notes	widened	to	more	than	5.5	percentage	points	.
--	In	August	,	Resorts	International	Inc.	,	which	*T*-1	sold	more	than	$	500	million	*U*	of	junk	bonds	,	suspended	interest	payments	.
--	In	September	,	just	as	the	cash	squeeze	hit	Campeau	,	Lomas	Financial	Corp.	defaulted	on	$	145	million	*U*	of	notes	and	appeared	unlikely	*-1	to	pay	interest	on	a	total	of	$	1.2	billion	*U*	of	debt	securities	.
Meantime	,	regulators	are	becoming	increasingly	worried	as	the	rush	to	leverage	shows	no	signs	of	*-1	abating	.
Moody	's	says	0	the	frequency	of	corporate	credit	downgrades	is	the	highest	this	year	since	1982	.
In	addition	,	there	are	six	times	as	many	troubled	banks	as	there	were	in	the	recession	of	1981	,	according	to	the	Federal	Deposit	Insurance	Corp	.
``	The	era	of	the	1980s	is	about	compound	interest	and	the	reaching	for	it	,	''	says	*T*-1	James	Grant	,	editor	of	Grant	's	Interest	Rate	Observer	,	an	early	critic	of	the	junk	bond	market	.
``	What	we	've	begun	*-1	to	see	*T*-2	is	the	damage	to	businesses	of	*	paying	exorbitant	compound	interest	.
Businesses	were	borrowing	at	interest	rates	higher	than	their	own	earnings	.
What	we	're	seeing	*T*-1	now	is	the	wrenching	readjustment	of	asset	values	to	a	future	when	speculative-grade	debt	will	be	hard	*	to	obtain	rather	than	easy	*?*	*T*-2	.	''
Friday	's	Market	Activity
Prices	of	Treasury	bonds	surged	in	the	biggest	rally	of	the	year	as	investors	fled	a	plummeting	stock	market	.
The	benchmark	30-year	Treasury	bond	was	quoted	*-1	6	p.m.	EDT	at	103	12\/32	,	compared	*	with	100	27\/32	Thursday	,	up	2	1\/2	points	.
The	yield	on	the	benchmark	fell	to	7.82	%	,	the	lowest	since	March	31	,	1987	,	according	to	Technical	Data	Global	Markets	Group	.
The	``	flight	to	quality	''	began	late	in	the	day	and	followed	a	precipitous	fall	in	the	stock	market	.
Treasurys	opened	lower	,	*	reacting	negatively	to	news	that	the	producer	price	index	--	a	measure	of	inflation	on	the	wholesale	level	--	accelerated	in	September	.
Bond	prices	barely	budged	until	midday	.
Many	bond	market	participants	will	be	closely	eying	the	action	of	the	Federal	Reserve	,	which	*T*-1	might	repeat	its	October	1987	injection	of	huge	amounts	of	liquidity	*	to	buoy	the	financial	markets	and	keep	the	economy	from	*-2	slowing	into	a	recession	.
Prices	of	municipals	,	investment-grade	corporates	and	mortgage-backed	bonds	also	rose	,	but	lagged	behind	their	Treasury	counterparts	.
Mortgage	securities	rose	in	hectic	trading	,	with	most	of	the	activity	concentrated	in	Government	National	Mortgage	Association	9	%	coupon	securities	,	the	most	liquid	mortgage	issue	.
The	Ginnie	Mae	November	9	%	issue	ended	at	98	25\/32	,	up	7\/8	point	on	the	day	,	*	to	yield	about	9.28	%	to	a	12-year	average	life	assumption	.
Investment-grade	corporate	bonds	were	up	about	1\/2	to	3\/4	point	.
But	the	yield	spread	between	lower-quality	,	investment-grade	issues	and	higher-quality	bonds	widened	.
And	the	yields	on	telephone	and	utility	issues	rose	relative	to	other	investment-grade	bonds	in	anticipation	of	this	week	's	$	3	billion	*U*	bond	offering	by	the	Tennessee	Valley	Authority	.
Despite	rumors	that	the	TVA	's	long-awaited	offering	would	be	postponed	*-1	because	of	the	debacle	in	the	equity	markets	,	sources	in	the	underwriting	syndicate	said	0	they	expect	0	the	issue	will	be	priced	*-2	as	*	scheduled	.
One	of	the	sources	said	0	the	smaller	portions	of	$	750	million	*U*	each	of	five-year	and	10-year	bonds	have	already	been	``	substantially	oversubscribed	*-1	.	''
Municipal	bonds	rose	as	much	as	3\/4	point	.

Friday	's	190-point	plunge	in	stocks	does	not	come	atop	the	climate	of	anxiety	that	*T*-3	dominated	financial	markets	just	prior	to	their	1987	October	crash	,	and	mechanisms	have	been	put	*-2	in	place	*	to	keep	markets	more	orderly	.
Still	,	the	lesson	is	about	the	same	:	On	Friday	the	13th	,	the	market	was	spooked	*-1	by	Washington	.
The	consensus	along	the	street	seems	*-2	to	be	that	the	plunge	was	triggered	*-1	by	the	financing	problems	of	the	UAL	takeover	,	and	it	's	certainly	true	0	the	rout	began	immediately	after	the	UAL	trading	halt	.
Still	,	the	consensus	*ICH*-2	seems	almost	as	wide	that	one	faltering	bid	is	no	reason	0	*	to	write	down	the	value	of	all	U.S.	business	*T*-1	.
This	observation	leads	us	to	another	piece	of	news	moving	on	the	Dow	Jones	ticker	shortly	before	the	downturn	:	the	success	of	Senate	Democrats	in	*	stalling	the	capital	gains	tax	cut	.
The	real	value	of	all	shares	,	after	all	,	is	directly	impacted	*-1	by	the	tax	on	any	profits	-LRB-	all	the	more	so	given	the	limits	on	deductions	for	losses	that	*T*-2	show	0	gains	are	not	``	ordinary	income	''	-RRB-	.
And	market	expectations	clearly	have	been	raised	*-1	by	the	capital	gains	victory	in	the	House	last	month	.
An	hour	before	Friday	's	plunge	,	that	provision	was	stripped	*-1	from	the	tax	bill	,	*	leaving	it	with	$	5.4	billion	*U*	in	tax	increases	without	a	capital	gains	cut	.
There	is	a	great	deal	0	*T*-2	to	be	said	*-1	,	*	to	be	sure	,	for	*	stripping	the	garbage	out	of	the	reconciliation	bill	.
It	would	be	a	good	thing	if	Congress	started	*-1	to	decide	issues	one-by-one	on	their	individual	merits	without	trickery	.
For	one	thing	,	no	one	doubts	that	the	capital	gains	cut	would	pass	on	an	up-or-down	vote	.
Since	Senate	leaders	have	so	far	fogged	it	up	with	procedural	smokescreens	,	promises	of	a	cleaner	bill	are	suspect	.
Especially	so	since	President	Bush	has	been	weakened	*-1	by	the	Panama	fiasco	.
To	the	extent	that	the	UAL	troubles	contributed	to	the	plunge	,	they	are	another	instance	of	Washington	's	sticky	fingers	.
As	the	best	opportunities	for	corporate	restructurings	are	exhausted	*-1	of	course	,	at	some	point	the	market	will	start	*-2	to	reject	them	.
But	the	airlines	are	scarcely	a	clear	case	,	*	given	anti-takeover	mischief	by	Secretary	of	Transportation	Skinner	,	who	*T*-2	professes	*-4	to	believe	0	safety	will	be	compromised	*-1	if	KLM	and	British	Airways	own	interests	in	companies	that	*T*-3	fly	airplanes	.
Worse	,	Congress	has	started	*-1	to	jump	on	the	Skinner	bandwagon	.
James	Oberstar	,	the	Minnesota	Democrat	who	*T*-2	chairs	the	Public	Works	and	Transportation	Committee	's	aviation	subcommittee	,	has	put	an	anti-airline	takeover	bill	on	supersonic	speed	so	that	it	would	be	passed	*-1	in	time	*	to	affect	the	American	and	United	Air	Lines	bids	.
It	would	give	Mr.	Skinner	up	to	50	days	*	to	``	review	''	any	bid	for	15	%	or	more	of	the	voting	stock	of	any	U.S.	carrier	with	revenues	of	$	1	billion	*U*	or	more	.
So	the	UAL	deal	has	problems	,	and	the	market	loses	190	points	.
Congratulations	,	Mr.	Secretary	and	Mr.	Congressman	.
In	the	1987	crash	,	*	remember	,	the	market	was	shaken	*-1	by	a	Danny	Rostenkowski	proposal	*	to	tax	takeovers	out	of	existance	.
Even	more	important	,	in	our	view	,	was	*T*-1	the	Treasury	's	threat	*	to	thrash	the	dollar	.
The	Treasury	is	doing	the	same	thing	today	;	thankfully	,	the	dollar	is	not	under	1987-style	pressure	.
Also	,	traders	are	in	better	shape	*ICH*-1	*ICH*-2	today	than	in	1987	*	to	survive	selling	binges	.
They	are	better	capitalized	*-1	.
They	are	in	less	danger	of	*-1	losing	liquidity	simply	because	of	tape	lags	and	clearing	and	settlement	delays	.
The	Fed	promises	any	needed	liquidity	.
The	Big	Board	's	liaison	with	the	Chicago	Board	of	Trade	has	improved	;	it	*EXP*-1	will	be	interesting	*	to	learn	if	``	circuit	breakers	''	prove	*-2	to	be	a	good	idea	.
In	any	event	,	some	traders	see	stocks	as	underpriced	today	,	unlike	1987	.
There	is	nothing	wrong	with	the	market	that	*T*-2	ca	n't	be	cured	*-1	by	a	little	coherence	and	common	sense	in	Washington	.
But	on	the	bearish	side	,	that	may	be	too	much	0	*	to	expect	*T*-1	.
First	Chicago	Corp.	posted	a	third-quarter	loss	of	$	23.3	million	*U*	after	*-1	joining	other	big	banks	in	*-2	further	adding	to	its	reserves	for	losses	on	foreign	loans	.
The	parent	company	of	First	National	Bank	of	Chicago	,	with	$	48	billion	*U*	in	assets	,	said	0	it	set	aside	$	200	million	*U*	*	to	absorb	losses	on	loans	and	investments	in	financially	troubled	countries	.
The	addition	,	on	top	of	two	big	1987	additions	to	foreign-loan	reserves	,	brings	the	reserve	to	a	level	equaling	79	%	of	medium-term	and	long-term	loans	outstanding	to	troubled	nations	.
First	Chicago	since	1987	has	reduced	its	loans	to	such	nations	to	$	1.7	billion	*U*	from	$	3	billion	*U*	.
Despite	this	loss	,	First	Chicago	said	0	it	does	n't	need	*-1	to	sell	stock	*-1	to	raise	capital	.
During	the	quarter	,	the	company	realized	a	pretax	gain	of	$	60.4	million	*U*	from	the	sale	of	its	First	Chicago	Investment	Advisors	unit	.
Combined	foreign	exchange	and	bond	trading	profits	dipped	24	%	against	last	year	's	third	quarter	,	to	$	38.2	million	*U*	from	$	50.5	million	*U*	.
Gains	from	First	Chicago	's	venture	capital	unit	,	a	big	leveraged	buy-out	investor	,	rose	32	%	to	$	34	million	*U*	from	$	25.7	million	*U*	a	year	ago	.
Interest	income	and	most	fee	income	was	strong	.
Greece	's	second	bout	of	general	elections	this	year	is	slated	*-1	for	Nov.	5	.
For	those	hoping	*	to	see	a	modicum	of	political	normalcy	restored	--	in	view	of	Greece	's	eight-year	misadventure	under	autocratic	pseudosocialism	and	subsequent	three-month	hitch	with	a	conservative-communist	coalition	government	--	there	is	but	one	bright	sign	:	The	scandals	still	encircling	former	Prime	Minister	Andreas	Papandreou	and	his	fallen	socialist	government	are	like	flies	buzzing	around	a	rotting	carcass	.
In	the	mid-June	round	of	voting	,	Greeks	gave	no	clear	mandate	to	any	single	political	party	.
The	ad	interim	coalition	government	that	*T*-1	emerged	from	post-electoral	hagglings	was	,	in	essence	,	little	more	than	the	ill-conceived	offspring	of	ideological	miscegenation	:	On	one	side	,	the	center-right	New	Democracy	Party	,	headed	*	by	Constantine	Mitsotakis	.
On	the	other	,	the	so-called	Coalition	of	the	Left	and	Progress	--	a	quaint	and	rather	deceptive	title	for	a	merger	of	the	pro-Soviet	Communist	Party	of	Greece	and	its	Euro-Communist	cousin	,	the	Hellenic	Left	.
The	unifying	bond	for	this	left-right	mismatch	was	plain	:	PASOK	-LRB-	Mr.	Papandreou	's	party	-RRB-	as	common	political	enemy	.
The	ostensible	goal	was	a	mop-up	of	government	corruption	,	purportedly	at	all	levels	,	but	the	main	marks	were	Mr.	Papandreou	and	his	closest	associates	.
In	point	of	fact	,	this	catharsis	was	overdue	by	decades	.
When	*	reduced	to	buzzword	status	in	ex	parte	pledges	*T*-1	,	however	,	the	notion	transmogrified	into	a	promised	assault	,	with	targets	primarily	for	political	gains	,	not	justice	.
With	regard	to	Greece	's	long-bubbling	bank-looting	scandal	,	Mr.	Papandreou	's	principal	accuser	remains	George	Koskotas	,	former	owner	of	the	Bank	of	Crete	and	self-confessed	embezzler	,	now	residing	in	a	jail	cell	in	Salem	,	Mass.	,	from	where	he	is	fighting	extradition	proceedings	that	*T*-1	would	return	him	to	Greece	*T*-2	.
Mr.	Koskotas	's	credibility	is	,	at	best	,	problematic	.
He	has	ample	motive	*	to	shift	the	blame	,	and	his	testimony	has	also	been	found	*-1	less	than	forthright	on	numerous	points	.
Nevertheless	,	the	New	Democracy	and	Communist	parties	herald	his	assertions	as	proof	of	PASOK	complicity	.
Among	unanswered	questions	are	*T*-3	whether	Mr.	Papandreou	received	$	23	million	*U*	of	stolen	Bank	of	Crete	funds	and	an	additional	$	734,000	*U*	in	bribes	,	as	*	contended	*-4	;	whether	the	prime	minister	ordered	state	agencies	*-5	to	deposit	some	$	57	million	*U*	in	Mr.	Koskotas	's	bank	and	then	skim	off	the	interest	;	and	,	what	PASOK	's	cut	was	*T*-1	from	the	$	210	million	*U*	0	Mr.	Koskotas	pinched	*T*-2	.
Two	former	ministers	were	so	heavily	implicated	in	the	Koskotas	affair	that	PASOK	members	of	Parliament	voted	*-1	to	refer	them	to	the	special	court	.
But	eluding	parliamentary	probe	was	*T*-2	the	case	of	millions	of	drachmas	0	Mr.	Koskotas	funneled	*T*-1	into	New	Democracy	coffers	.
In	the	end	,	the	investigation	produced	only	circumstantial	evidence	and	``	indications	''	that	*T*-1	point	to	PASOK	,	not	clinching	proof	.
On	another	issue	,	Greeks	were	told	*-1	how	their	national	intelligence	agency	,	the	EYP	,	regularly	monitored	the	telephone	conversations	of	prominent	figures	,	including	key	opposition	politicians	,	journalists	and	PASOK	cabinet	members	.
Despite	convincing	arguments	,	it	was	never	established	*-1	that	Mr.	Papandreou	personally	ordered	or	directed	the	wiretaps	.
The	central	weakness	of	the	``	scandals	''	debates	was	pointed	up	especially	well	when	discussions	focused	on	arms	deals	and	kickbacks	*T*-1	.
The	coalition	government	tried	*-1	to	show	that	PASOK	ministers	had	received	hefty	sums	for	*	OKing	the	purchase	of	F-16	Fighting	Falcon	and	Mirage	2000	combat	aircraft	,	produced	*	by	the	U.S.based	General	Dynamics	Corp.	and	France	's	Avions	Marcel	Dassault	,	respectively	.
Naturally	,	neither	General	Dynamics	nor	Dassault	could	be	expected	*-1	to	hamper	its	prospective	future	dealings	by	*-2	making	disclosures	of	sums	paid	*	-LRB-	or	not	-RRB-	to	various	Greek	officials	for	services	rendered	*	.
So	it	seems	that	Mr.	Mitsotakis	and	his	communist	chums	may	have	unwittingly	served	Mr.	Papandreou	a	moral	victory	on	a	platter	:	PASOK	,	whether	guilty	or	not	,	can	now	traipse	the	countryside	*	condemning	the	whole	affair	as	a	witch	hunt	at	Mr.	Papandreou	's	expense	.
But	while	verbal	high	jinks	alone	wo	n't	help	PASOK	regain	power	,	Mr.	Papandreou	should	never	be	underestimated	*-1	.
First	came	*T*-1	his	predictable	fusillade	:	He	charged	0	the	Coalition	of	the	Left	and	Progress	had	sold	out	its	leftist	tenets	by	*	collaborating	in	a	right-wing	plot	aimed	*	at	*	ousting	PASOK	and	thwarting	the	course	of	socialism	in	Greece	.
Then	,	*-1	to	buttress	his	credibility	with	the	left	,	he	enticed	some	smaller	leftist	parties	to	stand	for	election	under	the	PASOK	banner	.
Next	,	he	continued	*-2	to	court	the	communists	--	many	of	whom	*T*-1	feel	betrayed	by	the	left-right	coalition	's	birth	--	by	*	bringing	into	PASOK	a	well-respected	Communist	Party	candidate	.
For	balance	,	and	in	hopes	of	*-1	gaining	some	disaffected	centrist	votes	,	he	managed	*-1	to	attract	a	former	New	Democracy	Party	representative	and	known	political	enemy	of	Mr.	Mitsotakis	.
Thus	PASOK	heads	for	the	polls	not	only	with	diminished	scandal-stench	,	but	also	with	``	seals	of	approval	''	from	representatives	of	its	harshest	accusers	.
Crucial	as	these	elections	are	for	Greece	,	pressing	issues	of	state	are	getting	lost	in	the	shuffle	.
The	country	's	future	NATO	participation	remains	unsure	,	for	instance	.
Greece	also	must	revamp	major	pieces	of	legislation	in	preparation	for	the	1992	targets	of	heightened	Common	Market	cooperation	.
Greece	's	bilateral	relations	with	the	U.S.	need	attention	soon	as	well	.
For	one	,	the	current	accord	concerning	U.S.	military	bases	in	Greece	lapses	in	May	1990	.
Negotiations	for	a	new	agreement	were	frozen	*-1	before	the	June	elections	,	but	the	clock	is	running	.
Another	matter	of	concern	is	the	extradition	of	Mohammed	Rashid	,	a	Palestinian	terrorist	who	*T*-2	is	wanted	*-1	in	the	U.S.	for	the	1982	bombing	of	a	Pan	American	Airways	flight	.
The	Greek	courts	have	decided	in	favor	of	extradition	in	the	Rashid	case	,	but	the	matter	awaits	final	approval	from	Greece	's	next	justice	minister	.
The	Greeks	seem	barely	aware	of	the	importance	of	the	case	as	a	litmus	test	of	whether	Greece	will	be	counted	*-1	in	or	out	for	international	efforts	*	to	combat	terrorism	.
That	PASOK	could	win	the	elections	outright	is	improbable	;	the	Greek	press	,	previously	eager	*	to	palm	off	PASOK	's	line	,	has	turned	on	Mr.	Papandreou	with	a	wild-eyed	vengeance	.
Yet	the	possibility	of	another	lash-up	government	is	all	too	real	.
If	Mr.	Papandreou	becomes	the	major	opposition	leader	,	he	could	hamstring	a	conservative-led	coalition	.
Also	,	he	could	force	new	elections	early	next	year	by	*	frustrating	the	procedures	for	the	election	of	the	president	of	the	republic	in	March	.
New	Democracy	has	once	again	glaringly	underestimated	the	opponent	and	linked	its	own	prospects	to	negative	reaction	against	PASOK	,	*	forgetting	*-1	to	tend	to	either	program	clarity	or	the	rectification	of	internal	squabbles	.
As	for	Mr.	Papandreou	?
He	's	not	exactly	sitting	pretty	at	this	stage	.
But	since	he	is	undoubtedly	one	of	the	most	proficient	bull	slingers	who	*T*-1	ever	raked	muck	,	it	*EXP*-2	seems	far	wiser	*	to	view	him	as	sidelined	,	but	certainly	not	yet	eliminated	.

The	decision	was	based	*-1	solely	on	problems	with	the	UAL	management-pilot	plan	,	they	said	0	*T*-2	.
The	surge	in	producer	prices	in	September	followed	three	months	of	declines	,	but	analysts	were	divided	on	whether	the	0.9	%	jump	signaled	a	severe	worsening	of	inflation	.
Also	,	retail	sales	grew	0.5	%	last	month	.
A	capital-gains	tax	cut	was	removed	*-1	from	the	Senate	's	deficit	reduction	bill	,	but	proponents	still	hope	*-2	to	enact	the	cut	this	year	.

A	federal	appeals	court	in	San	Francisco	ruled	that	shareholders	ca	n't	hold	corporate	officials	liable	for	false	sales	projections	on	new	products	if	the	news	media	concurrently	revealed	substantial	information	about	the	product	's	flaws	.
The	ruling	stems	from	a	1984	suit	filed	*	by	shareholders	of	Apple	Computer	Inc.	,	claiming	that	company	officials	misled	investors	about	the	expected	success	of	the	Lisa	computer	,	introduced	*	in	1983	.
Lawyers	specializing	in	shareholder	suits	said	0	they	are	concerned	that	use	of	the	``	press	defense	''	by	corporations	may	become	popular	as	a	result	of	the	ruling	.
According	to	the	suit	,	Apple	officials	created	public	excitement	by	*-2	touting	Lisa	as	an	office	computer	that	*T*-1	would	revolutionize	the	workplace	and	be	extremely	successful	in	its	first	year	.
The	plaintiffs	also	alleged	that	prior	to	the	fanfare	,	the	company	circulated	internal	memos	indicating	problems	with	Lisa	.
The	suit	claimed	0	Apple	's	stock	climbed	to	a	high	of	$	63.50	*U*	a	share	on	the	basis	of	the	company	's	optimistic	forecasts	.
But	when	the	company	revealed	Lisa	's	poor	sales	late	in	1983	*T*-1	,	the	stock	plummeted	to	a	low	of	$	17.37	*U*	a	share	,	according	to	the	suit	.
The	shareholders	claimed	more	than	$	150	million	*U*	in	losses	.
In	1987	,	the	San	Francisco	district	court	dismissed	the	case	largely	because	newspaper	reports	had	sufficiently	counterbalanced	the	company	's	statements	by	*	alerting	consumers	to	Lisa	's	problems	.
Late	last	month	,	the	appeals	court	agreed	that	most	of	the	case	should	be	dismissed	*-1	.
However	,	it	gave	the	shareholders	the	right	*	to	pursue	a	small	portion	of	their	claim	that	*T*-1	pertains	to	Lisa	's	disk	drive	,	known	*	as	Twiggy	.
The	court	ruled	that	the	news	media	did	n't	reveal	Twiggy	's	problems	at	the	time	.
Lawyers	are	worried	about	the	ruling	's	implication	in	other	shareholder	suits	but	pointed	out	that	the	court	stressed	that	the	ruling	should	be	regarded	*-1	as	very	specific	to	the	Apple	case	.
``	The	court	was	careful	*	to	say	that	the	adverse	information	appeared	in	the	very	same	articles	*RNR*-1	and	received	the	same	attention	*RNR*-1	as	the	company	's	statements	,	''	said	*T*-4	Patrick	Grannon	,	a	Los	Angeles	lawyer	at	the	firm	of	Greenfield	&	Chimicles	,	which	*T*-3	was	n't	involved	*-2	in	the	case	.
``	The	court	is	saying	that	the	adverse	facts	have	*-2	to	be	transferred	*-1	to	the	market	with	equal	intensity	and	credibility	as	the	statements	of	corporate	insiders	.	''
Shareholders	'	attorneys	at	the	New	York	firm	of	Milberg	,	Weiss	,	Bershad	,	Specthrie	&	Lerach	last	week	petitioned	for	a	rehearing	of	the	case	.
They	wrote	:	``	The	opinion	establishes	a	new	rule	of	immunity	--	that	if	a	wide	variety	of	opinions	on	a	company	's	business	are	publicly	reported	*-1	,	the	company	can	say	anything	without	fear	of	securities	liability	.	''
NFL	ORDERED	*-1	to	pay	$	5.5	million	*U*	in	legal	fees	to	defunct
The	National	Football	League	is	considering	*-1	appealing	the	ruling	stemming	from	the	U.S.	Football	League	's	largely	unsuccessful	antitrust	suit	against	the	NFL	.
A	jury	in	1986	agreed	with	the	USFL	's	claims	that	the	NFL	monopolized	major	league	football	.
But	the	jury	awarded	the	USFL	only	$	1	*U*	in	damages	,	trebled	because	of	the	antitrust	claims	.
Last	week	,	the	U.S.	Court	of	Appeals	in	New	York	upheld	a	$	5.5	million	*U*	award	of	attorneys	fees	to	the	defunct	league	.
Harvey	D.	Myerson	,	of	Myerson	&	Kuhn	,	then	of	Finley	,	Kumble	,	Wagner	,	Heine	,	Underberg	,	Manley	,	Myerson	&	Casey	,	was	the	lead	trial	lawyer	,	and	his	new	firm	pursued	the	application	appeal	.
Douglas	R.	Pappas	of	Myerson	&	Kuhn	says	0	about	$	5.3	million	*U*	of	the	award	goes	directly	to	the	USFL	*	to	reimburse	it	for	fees	already	paid	.
Myerson	&	Kuhn	will	get	about	$	260,000	*U*	for	the	costs	of	*	pressing	the	application	.
The	federal	appeals	court	held	that	the	nominal	damages	and	the	failure	*	to	prove	all	claims	did	n't	exclude	the	USFL	from	*	being	reimbursed	*-1	.
Antitrust	laws	provide	that	injured	parties	may	be	reimbursed	*-1	for	lawyers	'	fees	.
But	Shepard	Goldfein	,	an	attorney	for	the	NFL	,	says	0	his	client	will	consider	*-1	asking	for	another	hearing	or	appealing	to	the	U.S.	Supreme	Court	.
Mr.	Goldfein	,	of	Skadden	,	Arps	,	Slate	,	Meagher	&	Flom	in	New	York	,	says	0	the	ruling	is	wrong	and	the	fee	award	is	excessive	because	the	USFL	lost	its	major	claims	,	including	its	contention	that	the	NFL	restrained	trade	through	television	contracts	.
``	The	USFL	was	not	the	prevailing	party	,	''	Mr.	Goldfein	insists	*T*-1	.
HOUSTON-CALGARY	ALLIANCE	:
Fulbright	&	Jaworski	of	Houston	and	Fenerty	,	Robertson	,	Fraser	&	Hatch	of	Calgary	,	Alberta	,	are	affiliating	*-1	to	help	serve	their	energy-industry	clients	.
The	affiliation	is	believed	*-1	to	be	the	first	such	cross-border	arrangement	among	major	law	firms	.
The	firms	are	n't	required	*-1	to	refer	work	exclusively	to	each	other	and	remain	separate	organizations	.
But	they	will	work	together	on	energy	-	,	environmental	-	and	fair-trade-related	issues	and	conduct	seminars	on	topics	of	mutual	interest	,	said	*T*-1	Gibson	Gayle	Jr.	of	585-lawyer	Fulbright	&	Jaworski	.
In	addition	,	Fulbright	&	Jaworski	's	Washington	,	D.C.	,	office	will	play	a	key	role	as	the	firms	work	together	on	regulatory	issues	,	particularly	natural-gas	exports	,	for	their	clients	.
The	arrangement	,	reached	*	after	about	eight	months	of	negotiations	,	grew	out	of	80-lawyer	Fenerty	Robertson	's	desire	*	to	develop	ties	with	a	U.S.	firm	in	light	of	relaxed	trade	barriers	between	the	U.S.	and	Canada	,	said	*T*-1	Francis	M.	Saville	of	Fenerty	Robertson	.
IN	WHAT	*T*-1	MAY	SIGNAL	a	turnaround	for	asbestos	manufacturers	,	W.R.	Grace	&	Co.	won	a	3	1\/2-week	trial	in	Pittsburgh	over	whether	it	should	be	required	*-2	to	remove	asbestos	fireproofing	from	a	local	high	school	.
Mount	Lebanon	High	School	,	near	Pittsburgh	,	sought	$	21	million	*U*	in	compensatory	damages	from	Grace	,	*	arguing	that	the	asbestos	,	which	*T*-1	can	cause	respiratory	diseases	and	lung	cancer	,	posed	a	risk	to	students	.
Grace	successfully	contended	that	*	removing	the	fire	retardant	would	pose	a	greater	health	risk	than	*	leaving	it	alone	.
A	spokesman	for	the	company	said	0	the	verdict	is	thought	*-2	to	be	the	first	in	favor	of	an	asbestos	manufacturer	where	the	plaintiff	was	a	school	and	the	asbestos	in	question	was	used	*-1	for	fireproofing	*T*-3	.

Apple	will	offer	a	$	150	*U*	rebate	on	its	Apple	IIGS	with	any	Apple	Monitor	and	disk	drive	;	$	200	*U*	on	the	basic	Macintosh	Plus	central	processing	unit	;	$	250	*U*	on	the	Macintosh	SE	central	processing	unit	;	$	250	*U*	on	the	Macintosh	SE\/30	cpu	,	and	$	300	*U*	on	a	Macintosh	IIcx	with	any	Apple	video	card	and	Apple	monitor	.

Roger	Rosenblatt	,	editor	of	U.S.	News	&	World	Report	,	resigned	Friday	from	the	weekly	news	magazine	.
Mr.	Rosenblatt	said	0	he	resigned	because	of	difficulties	with	*	commuting	between	his	home	in	New	York	and	the	magazine	's	editorial	offices	in	Washington	.
``	Frankly	,	I	missed	my	family	,	''	said	*T*-1	Mr.	Rosenblatt	.
In	Mr.	Rosenblatt	's	tenure	,	the	magazine	's	advertising	pages	and	circulation	have	grown	significantly	.
But	at	2.3	million	weekly	paid	circulation	,	U.S.	News	still	ranks	*-2	third	*T*-1	behind	Time	Warner	Inc.	's	Time	magazine	,	with	4.4	million	circulation	,	and	Washington	Post	Co.	's	Newsweek	,	with	3.3	million	circulation	.

He	said	0	he	will	now	consider	those	offers	.
Avions	Marcel	Dassault-Breguet	Aviation	S.A.	said	0	group	profit	before	taxes	and	contributions	to	employee	profit-sharing	soared	97	%	to	839	million	francs	-LRB-	$	129.6	million	*U*	-RRB-	in	the	first	half	of	1989	from	425	million	francs	a	year	earlier	.
The	French	aircraft	group	pointed	out	,	however	,	that	financial	results	from	its	sector	of	industry	are	frequently	erratic	because	of	irregular	cash	flow	from	large	contracts	.
It	noted	,	for	example	,	that	group	revenue	for	the	first	half	was	8.734	billion	francs	,	down	about	12	%	from	9.934	billion	francs	a	year	earlier	.
Still	,	it	said	0	it	expects	sales	for	all	of	1989	to	be	on	the	order	of	20	billion	francs	,	*	reflecting	anticipated	billings	for	two	large	contracts	in	the	second	half	of	the	year	.
For	all	of	1988	,	Dassault	had	group	profit	of	428	million	francs	on	revenue	of	18.819	billion	francs	.

Keystone	Consolidated	Industries	Inc.	expects	*-1	to	report	earnings	before	extraordinary	tax	benefits	of	about	$	1.5	million	*U*	,	or	about	41	cents	a	share	,	for	the	third	quarter	,	compared	with	a	loss	last	year	,	said	0	*T*-2	Glenn	R.	Simmons	,	chairman	and	chief	executive	officer	.
After	a	tax	benefit	of	about	$	780,000	*U*	,	Keystone	expects	*-2	to	report	net	income	of	$	2.3	million	*U*	,	or	about	62	cents	a	share	,	Mr.	Simmons	said	0	*T*-1	.

Revenue	for	the	latest	third	quarter	was	about	$	70.5	million	*U*	,	up	10	%	from	$	63.6	million	*U*	last	year	,	he	said	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Simmons	said	0	the	results	signal	a	turnaround	for	the	maker	of	wire	and	wire	products	,	which	*T*-1	has	struggled	*-2	to	remain	competitive	in	the	face	of	lower-priced	,	imported	steel	.
A	new	$	46	million	*U*	steel	rod	minimill	,	which	*T*-1	got	off	to	a	rocky	start	in	early	1988	,	now	is	running	efficiently	and	a	new	management	team	is	more	heavily	marketing	Keystone	's	products	,	Mr.	Simmons	said	0	*T*-2	.
As	a	result	,	the	company	hopes	*-1	to	report	net	income	for	the	year	of	about	$	11.6	million	*U*	,	or	about	$	3.10	*U*	to	$	3.15	*U*	a	share	,	compared	with	a	net	loss	of	$	24.4	million	*U*	last	year	,	after	a	loss	from	discontinued	operations	of	$	18.4	million	*U*	.
Revenue	for	1989	is	expected	*-1	to	be	about	$	300	million	*U*	,	up	about	21	%	from	$	247.3	million	*U*	in	1988	.

Revenue	for	the	nine	months	is	expected	*-1	to	be	about	$	230.5	million	*U*	,	up	about	21	%	from	$	190.4	million	*U*	last	year	.
Mr.	Simmons	said	0	Keystone	's	new	mill	is	expected	*	to	produce	about	585,000	tons	of	steel	rods	this	year	,	up	from	413,000	tons	in	1988	.
Production	at	the	mill	has	exceeded	the	ability	*ICH*-2	of	Keystone	's	casting	operation	*	to	supply	it	,	he	said	0	*T*-3	,	which	*T*-1	will	force	Keystone	*-4	to	purchase	billet	,	or	unfinished	steel	bars	,	from	outside	the	company	during	the	fourth	quarter	and	next	year	.
Keystone	will	have	*-1	to	consider	*-2	expanding	its	casting	operation	,	at	an	estimated	cost	of	$	8	million	to	$	10	million	*U*	,	within	the	next	18	to	24	months	,	Mr.	Simmons	said	0	*T*-3	.
Under	Robert	W.	Singer	,	who	*T*-2	was	named	*-1	president	and	chief	operating	officer	last	year	,	Keystone	has	expanded	its	sales	force	to	about	20	people	from	about	15	and	hopes	*-3	*	to	expand	its	sales	from	the	middle	portion	of	the	country	toward	the	East	and	West	coasts	.
``	Prior	to	a	year	ago	,	Keystone	was	an	order-taker	.
Now	I	think	0	we	have	a	group	of	marketing	people	who	*T*-1	are	out	*	selling	to	retailers	and	wholesalers	,	''	Mr.	Simmons	said	*T*-2	.
Still	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	,	the	100-year-old	company	plans	*-2	to	continue	its	premium-priced	strategy	for	its	distinctive	brand	of	red-tipped	wire	fencing	and	other	products	.
The	company	claims	a	40	%	share	of	the	U.S.	field	fence	business	,	a	35	%	share	of	poultry	netting	sales	and	a	30	%	share	of	barbed	wire	sales	.
Freeport-McMoRan	Inc.	said	0	a	temporary	cessation	of	operations	at	its	Sunshine	Bridge	uranium-recovery	facility	in	Donaldsonville	,	La.	,	will	result	in	slight	earnings	improvement	to	both	the	company	and	its	Freeport-McMoRan	Resource	Partners	Limited	Partnership	unit	.
The	company	did	n't	elaborate	.
The	diversified	energy	and	minerals	concern	said	that	a	depressed	uranium	market	is	responsible	for	the	temporary	mothballing	of	the	plant	,	but	that	the	plant	can	be	reactivated	*-1	quickly	when	the	market	improves	*T*-2	.
More	than	400,000	pounds	of	uranium	a	year	have	been	produced	*-1	at	the	facility	during	the	past	seven	years	.
A	second	uranium-recovery	plant	at	Uncle	Sam	,	La.	,	that	*T*-1	produces	more	than	700,000	pounds	of	uranium	annually	,	will	continue	*-2	to	operate	.
Freeport-McMoRan	said	0	the	shutdown	wo	n't	affect	sales	volumes	under	long-term	sales	contracts	of	its	Freeport	Uranium	Recovery	Co.	unit	,	but	will	reduce	the	amount	of	product	sold	*	on	the	spot	market	.

Business	Week	subscribers	may	hear	this	week	's	issue	talking	back	to	them	.
A	four-page	ad	from	Texas	Instruments	Inc.	,	running	in	approximately	140,000	issues	of	the	Oct.	20	``	Corporate	Elite	''	issue	of	the	McGraw-Hill	Inc.	publication	,	contains	a	speech	synthesizer	laminated	*	between	two	of	the	pages	.
Readers	who	*T*-1	pull	off	a	piece	of	tape	and	press	a	switch	will	hear	a	tiny	--	but	distinctly	human-sounding	--	voice	announce	,	``	I	am	the	talking	chip	,	''	as	it	launches	into	a	15-second	discourse	on	its	own	attributes	.
The	talking	chip	is	n't	cheap	--	the	per-ad	cost	to	Texas	Instruments	is	about	$	4	*U*	,	and	that	's	without	*	adding	in	Business	Week	's	charge	--	but	Texas	Instruments	believes	0	it	is	a	first	.
Previous	efforts	have	included	musical	ads	,	featuring	simple	tone-generating	chips	that	*T*-1	play	a	tune	,	but	the	voice	synthesizer	in	this	effort	is	much	more	sophisticated	,	with	none	of	the	robotic	flatness	that	one	hears	*T*-2	,	for	example	,	when	*-4	calling	telephone	directory	services	*T*-3	.
And	for	those	who	*T*-1	miss	the	message	the	first	time	around	,	not	*	to	worry	:	Three	tiny	batteries	provide	enough	juice	for	as	many	as	650	replays	.
Lomas	Financial	Corp.	,	Dallas	,	said	0	it	will	ask	a	U.S.	bankruptcy	court	*-1	to	allow	it	*	to	hire	Lazard	Freres	&	Co.	*	to	help	it	sell	its	leasing	unit	.
Lomas	,	assisted	*	by	Merrill	Lynch	Capital	Markets	,	has	been	trying	*-1	to	sell	its	Equitable	Lomas	Leasing	Co.	for	several	months	,	apparently	without	success	.
The	real	estate	and	mortgage	banking	concern	had	hoped	*-1	to	use	proceeds	from	the	sale	*	to	reduce	its	debt	.
*-2	Without	cash	from	asset	sales	and	unable	*	to	reach	a	new	bank-credit	agreement	,	Lomas	defaulted	on	$	145	million	*U*	in	notes	that	*T*-1	became	due	Sept.	1	.
It	filed	for	protection	from	creditors	under	Chapter	11	of	the	federal	Bankruptcy	Code	Sept.	24	*	to	give	it	additional	time	0	*	to	work	on	a	plan	*	to	restructure	its	$	1.45	billion	*U*	in	senior	debt	*T*-1	.
Lomas	said	0	Merrill	Lynch	,	which	*T*-1	owns	bonds	and	equity	in	Lomas	,	could	n't	continue	as	Lomas	's	investment	banker	because	it	is	also	a	creditor	.
It	said	0	it	chose	Lazard	in	part	because	of	Lazard	's	offices	in	Europe	and	Japan	,	where	investors	might	be	interested	in	a	U.S.	leasing	company	*T*-1	.
Canadian	Imperial	Bank	of	Commerce	said	0	it	will	increase	its	loan-loss	provisions	*-1	to	cover	all	its	loans	to	lesser	developed	countries	,	except	Mexico	,	*	resulting	in	an	after-tax	charge	to	1989	earnings	of	300	million	Canadian	dollars	-LRB-	US$	255	million	*U*	-RRB-	.
Don	Bowder	,	senior	vice	president	and	chief	accountant	,	said	0	the	bank	's	strong	earnings	enable	it	to	be	the	first	major	Canadian	bank	0	*T*-1	to	set	aside	provisions	covering	all	its	C$	1.17	billion	*U*	in	non-Mexican	LDC	debt	.
``	It	eliminates	the	continuing	uncertainty	with	respect	to	the	ultimate	value	of	the	loans	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
The	bank	said	0	about	C$	525	million	*U*	will	be	added	*-1	to	its	existing	LDC	and	general	loss	provisions	in	its	fourth	quarter	,	ending	Oct.	31	.
Mr.	Bowder	said	0	the	C$	300	million	*U*	charge	to	earnings	would	amount	to	about	C$	1.34	*U*	a	share	.
The	bank	's	net	income	for	the	nine	months	ended	July	31	was	C$	577	million	*U*	,	or	C$	3.10	*U*	a	share	.
Mr.	Bowder	said	0	the	bank	will	restructure	its	C$	604	million	*U*	of	Mexican	debt	,	of	which	C$	255	million	*U*	is	in	Mexican	notes	secured	*	by	U.S.	government	bonds	.
The	bank	has	a	45	%	reserve	against	the	remaining	C$	349	million	*U*	of	Mexican	debt	and	expects	*-1	to	swap	that	for	other	Mexican	notes	supported	*	by	U.S.	Treasury	zero-coupon	bonds	.
Mr.	Bowder	said	0	the	bank	's	experience	with	LDC	debt	has	been	``	painful	''	and	this	latest	move	represents	the	final	phase	of	a	program	begun	*	seven	years	ago	*	to	reduce	its	exposure	through	provisioning	,	debt	sales	and	debt	swaps	.
He	said	0	the	bank	will	no	longer	participate	in	LDC	sovereign	lending	,	but	will	support	trade	financing	and	other	transactions	that	*T*-1	meet	the	bank	's	standards	.
The	carnage	among	takeover	stocks	Friday	does	n't	mean	the	end	of	mega-mergers	but	simply	marks	the	start	of	a	less	ambitious	game	,	Wall	Street	's	big-time	deal	makers	say	*T*-1	.
Suitors	from	now	on	are	more	likely	*	to	be	expansion-minded	companies	,	rather	than	raiders	or	debt-happy	financiers	.
And	they	will	be	launching	lower-priced	and	perhaps	fewer	deals	,	now	that	it	*EXP*-1	's	tougher	*	to	finance	them	.
This	is	an	ominous	sign	for	a	stock	market	that	*T*-2	lately	has	been	fueled	*-1	by	takeover	speculation	and	bidding	wars	for	companies	that	*T*-3	put	themselves	up	for	sale	.
Whenever	the	1980s	merger	boom	seems	*-1	to	be	stalling	*T*-2	,	shock	waves	ripple	through	the	stock	market	.
``	The	market	is	overvalued	,	not	cheap	,	''	says	*T*-1	Alan	Gaines	of	the	New	York	money-management	firm	Gaines	Berland	.
He	recently	began	*-1	increasing	his	cash	position	to	45	%	of	his	portfolio	.
``	I	look	at	where	deals	can	get	done	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	,	``	and	they	're	not	getting	done	''	at	current	prices	.
Lenders	are	growing	increasingly	nervous	about	debt-financed	takeovers	,	investment	bankers	say	0	*T*-1	.
``	You	had	a	week	of	a	deteriorating	junk-bond	market	that	*T*-1	ran	smack	into	the	news	on	Friday	about	what	*T*-2	appeared	*-3	to	be	happening	to	the	bank	debt	market	,	''	says	*T*-4	Steven	Rattner	,	a	partner	and	merger	specialist	with	Lazard	Freres	&	Co	.
Trading	dried	up	Friday	in	the	market	for	high-yield	junk	bonds	,	often	used	*	*-1	to	finance	takeovers	.
It	was	the	latest	in	a	series	of	setbacks	for	the	junk	bond	market	,	where	prices	began	*	weakening	last	month	after	Campeau	hit	a	cash	crunch	*T*-1	.
And	banks	appear	*-1	to	be	taking	an	increasingly	skeptical	view	of	requests	for	high-risk	takeover	loans	.
The	group	trying	*	to	buy	UAL	announced	Friday	that	it	could	n't	arrange	the	$	7.2	billion	*U*	in	bank	loans	0	it	needs	*T*-1	*	to	buy	the	parent	of	United	Airlines	for	$	300	*U*	a	share	.
Takeover-stock	traders	today	will	be	scrambling	*-1	to	learn	of	any	UAL	developments	,	and	other	takeover	stocks	are	likely	*	to	trade	in	sympathy	.
Investment	bankers	representing	the	buy-out	group	and	UAL	's	board	spent	a	frantic	weekend	*	trying	*-2	to	hammer	out	new	terms	that	*T*-1	would	be	more	acceptable	to	the	banks	.
After	UAL	,	the	stock	viewed	*	as	most	vulnerable	is	American	Airlines	'	parent	AMR	,	the	target	of	a	$	120-a-share	*U*	takeover	proposal	from	New	York	real	estate	developer	Donald	Trump	.
*	Trading	in	AMR	shares	was	suspended	*-1	shortly	after	3	p.m.	EDT	Friday	and	did	n't	resume	.
Before	the	halt	,	AMR	last	traded	at	98	5\/8	.
Late	Friday	night	,	the	London	office	of	Jefferies	&	Co.	,	a	Los	Angeles	securities	firm	,	traded	AMR	shares	at	prices	as	low	as	80	.
Similarly	,	Delta	Air	Lines	and	USAir	Group	dropped	10.1	%	and	8.5	%	,	respectively	,	on	Friday	and	could	weaken	further	.
Over	the	weeked	,	however	,	two	developments	in	other	deals	indicated	that	commerical	banks	and	Wall	Street	firms	still	are	willing	*-1	to	commit	billions	of	dollars	*-2	to	finance	takeover	bids	launched	*	by	major	companies	.
Vitro	S.A.	,	a	major	Mexican	glass	maker	,	said	yesterday	that	it	agreed	*-2	to	buy	Anchor	Glass	Container	in	a	tender	offer	for	$	21.25	*U*	a	share	,	sweetened	*	from	the	original	$	20-a-share	*U*	offer	0	Vitro	launched	*T*-1	two	months	ago	.
On	Friday	,	Anchor	shares	fell	1	1\/4	*	to	close	at	18	1\/2	.
For	the	broader	market	,	the	greatest	significance	of	the	Vitro-Anchor	deal	may	be	that	it	was	put	*-1	together	late	Friday	night	--	after	the	market	rout	--	and	involves	a	$	155	million	*U*	temporary	``	bridge	''	loan	from	Donaldson	,	Lufkin	&	Jenrette	Securities	and	a	$	139	million	*U*	loan	from	Security	Pacific	National	Bank	.
Moreover	,	*-2	to	complete	the	entire	Anchor	Glass	purchase	and	refinance	existing	debt	,	Donaldson	said	0	it	is	``	highly	confident	''	that	it	will	be	able	*-1	to	sell	$	400	million	*U*	of	junk	bonds	for	Vitro	,	despite	the	current	disarray	in	the	junk	bond	market	.
Donaldson	's	statement	is	n't	merely	an	idle	boast	,	because	those	bonds	will	have	*-2	to	be	sold	*-1	before	Donaldson	's	bridge	loan	can	be	paid	*-3	back	.
Security	Pacific	,	meanwhile	,	said	0	it	expects	*-1	to	arrange	$	430	million	*U*	in	bank	loans	for	Vitro	.
In	another	takeover	battle	,	a	spokesman	for	McCaw	Cellular	Communications	said	yesterday	that	McCaw	has	been	advised	*-1	by	three	commercial	banks	that	they	remain	``	highly	confident	''	0	they	can	arrange	$	4.5	billion	*U*	of	bank	loans	for	McCaw	's	tender	offer	for	about	45	%	of	LIN	Broadcasting	,	``	notwithstanding	recent	events	.	''
McCaw	is	offering	$	125	*U*	a	share	for	22	million	LIN	shares	,	*-1	thereby	challenging	LIN	's	proposal	*	to	spin	off	its	television	properties	,	pay	shareholders	a	$	20-a-share	*U*	special	dividend	and	combine	its	cellular-telephone	operations	with	BellSouth	's	cellular	business	.
On	Friday	,	LIN	shares	were	among	the	few	takeover	issues	that	*T*-1	did	n't	fall	much	,	*-2	dropping	5	1\/2	,	or	4.9	%	,	*-3	to	close	at	107	1\/2	.
Traders	and	investment	bankers	said	0	LIN	shares	were	n't	hurt	*-3	much	because	BellSouth	is	viewed	*-1	as	a	well-financed	corporate	buyer	unlikely	*	to	be	affected	*-2	by	skittishness	among	bankers	or	bond	buyers	.
Investment	bankers	interviewed	*	over	the	weekend	see	a	silver	lining	for	the	merger	business	in	the	stock-market	drop	.
Potential	bidders	for	companies	``	were	saying	that	things	were	beginning	*-2	to	look	expensive	,	''	says	0	*T*-1	Mr.	Rattner	of	Lazard	.
``	Nothing	makes	things	look	cheaper	than	a	200-point	drop	in	the	Dow	,	''	Mr.	Rattner	says	*T*-1	.
``	Just	as	there	are	people	waiting	*	to	become	bargain	hunters	in	the	stock	market	,	there	are	people	waiting	*	to	become	bargain	hunters	in	the	deal	market	.	''
Investment	bankers	expect	most	of	those	bargain	hunters	to	be	well-heeled	corporations	.
``	In	the	past	,	corporate	buyers	were	often	discouraged	*-1	from	*	making	bids	because	of	competition	from	LBO	firms	,	which	*T*-2	were	often	prepared	*	to	outbid	''	the	corporations	,	says	0	*T*-3	J.	Tomilson	Hill	,	head	of	mergers	and	acquisitions	at	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	.
Now	,	``	corporate	buyers	should	be	willing	*-2	to	re-enter	the	acquisition	market	because	the	competition	from	junkbond-financed	buyers	has	been	reduced	*-1	.	''
Many	takeover	stocks	plunged	Friday	,	as	speculators	retained	their	confidence	in	corporate	buyers	but	fled	from	the	socalled	whisper	stocks	,	the	targets	of	rumored	deals	.
Columbia	Pictures	Entertainment	,	which	*T*-1	has	agreed	to	a	friendly	$	27-a-share	*U*	bid	from	Sony	of	Japan	,	fell	only	1\/8	*	to	close	at	26	5\/8	.
But	several	stocks	long	rumored	*	to	be	ripe	for	a	takeover	or	restructuring	fell	10	%	or	more	.
They	include	USX	,	down	11.7	%	;	Upjohn	,	down	11.1	%	;	Campbell	Soup	,	down	11	%	;	Paramount	Communications	,	off	10.3	%	;	Woolworth	,	down	10.2	%	;	Delta	Air	Lines	,	down	10.1	%	,	and	MCA	,	down	9.7	%	.
The	market	--	and	investment	bankers	--	are	even	less	sanguine	about	companies	that	*T*-1	have	had	at	least	one	bid	,	merger	agreement	or	restructuring	plan	fall	through	already	.
Given	the	weakness	in	both	the	junk	bond	market	and	the	stock	market	,	traders	fear	that	these	transactions	may	be	revised	*-1	yet	again	.
Examples	include	Kollmorgen	,	whose	agreement	*	to	be	acquired	*-1	for	$	25	*U*	a	share	by	Vernitron	*T*-2	collapsed	last	month	.
Kollmorgen	shares	fell	nearly	20	%	on	Friday	*-1	to	close	at	12	7\/8	.
Ramada	,	which	*T*-1	first	delayed	*RNR*-3	and	then	shelved	*RNR*-3	a	$	400	million	*U*	junk	bond	sale	that	*T*-2	was	designed	*-4	to	help	*	finance	a	restructuring	,	fell	15.6	%	*	to	close	at	9	1\/2	.
Ramada	has	said	0	it	hopes	*-1	to	propose	a	new	restructuring	plan	but	has	n't	indicated	when	it	will	do	so	.
Shares	of	American	Medical	International	,	which	*T*-1	agreed	last	week	*-3	to	accept	a	lower	price	from	a	buy-out	group	that	*T*-2	includes	First	Boston	Corp.	and	the	Pritzker	family	of	Chicago	,	fell	15.8	%	on	Friday	*	to	close	at	20	.
The	buy-out	group	is	offering	$	26.50	*U*	a	share	for	63	million	American	Medical	shares	,	down	from	its	offer	in	July	of	$	28	*U*	a	share	for	68.8	million	shares	.
But	investment	bankers	say	0	the	market	may	have	oversold	some	takeover-related	stocks	.
Hilton	Hotels	,	for	example	,	was	among	the	worst-hit	issues	,	*	falling	20.2	%	*	to	close	at	85	,	down	21	1\/2	on	Friday	.
Hilton	currently	is	soliciting	bids	for	a	sale	of	part	or	all	of	its	hotel	and	casino	businesses	.
People	familiar	with	Hilton	said	over	the	weekend	that	the	depth	of	the	sell-off	in	Hilton	shares	was	unwarranted	because	none	of	the	likely	buyers	would	be	dependent	on	junk-bond	financing	.
However	,	they	conceded	that	some	potential	bidders	would	rely	on	bank	loans	and	would	*-1	be	hurt	if	the	troubles	of	the	UAL	buy-out	group	signified	a	general	unwillingness	*ICH*-2	among	banks	*	to	provide	credit	for	debt-financed	takeovers	.
Hilton	officials	said	0	they	were	n't	worried	about	the	drop	in	the	company	's	stock	.
William	Lebo	,	Hilton	's	general	counsel	,	said	0	plans	*	to	consider	a	sale	of	the	company	or	some	of	its	assets	are	``	on	track	''	for	what	*T*-2	has	been	described	*-1	previously	as	``	a	slow	and	deliberate	process	.	''
``	I	ca	n't	believe	that	any	potential	buyer	for	Hilton	would	be	affected	*-1	by	one	day	's	trading	,	''	Mr.	Lebo	said	*T*-2	.
But	the	stock	market	as	a	whole	,	*-1	bolstered	as	it	is	*?*	by	takeover	speculation	,	remains	vulnerable	to	any	further	pullback	by	takeover	financiers	,	both	in	the	junkbond	market	and	among	commercial	banks	.
For	debt-ridden	suitors	,	``	the	takeover	game	has	been	over	for	some	time	,	''	says	0	*T*-2	New	York	money	manager	Neil	Weisman	of	Chilmark	Capital	,	who	*T*-1	has	been	keeping	85	%	of	his	portfolio	in	cash	.
``	The	market	is	just	waking	up	to	that	point	.	''
Pauline	Yoshihashi	in	Los	Angeles	contributed	to	this	column	.
Of	all	the	one-time	expenses	incurred	*	by	a	corporation	or	professional	firm	,	few	*T*-1	are	larger	or	longer	term	than	the	purchase	of	real	estate	or	the	signing	of	a	commercial	lease	.
*	To	take	full	advantage	of	the	financial	opportunities	in	this	commitment	,	however	,	the	corporation	or	professional	firm	must	do	more	than	negotiate	the	best	purchase	price	or	lease	terms	.
It	must	also	evaluate	the	real-estate	market	in	the	chosen	location	from	a	new	perspective	.
Specifically	,	it	must	understand	how	real-estate	markets	overreact	to	shifts	in	regional	economies	*T*-1	and	then	take	advantage	of	these	opportunities	.
When	a	regional	economy	catches	cold	*T*-1	,	the	local	real-estate	market	gets	pneumonia	.
In	other	words	,	real-estate	market	indicators	,	such	as	building	permits	and	leasing	activity	,	plummet	much	further	than	a	local	economy	in	recession	.
This	was	seen	*-1	in	the	late	1960s	in	Los	Angeles	and	the	mid-1970s	in	New	York	.
But	the	reverse	is	also	true	:	When	a	region	's	economy	rebounds	from	a	slowdown	*T*-1	,	these	real-estate	indicators	will	rebound	far	faster	than	the	improving	economy	.
Why	do	local	real-estate	markets	overreact	to	regional	economic	cycles	*T*-1	?
Because	real-estate	purchases	and	leases	are	such	major	long-term	commitments	that	most	companies	and	individuals	make	these	decisions	only	when	*-2	confident	of	future	economic	stability	and	growth	*T*-1	.
Metropolitan	Detroit	was	written	*-1	off	economically	during	the	early	1980s	,	as	the	domestic	auto	industry	suffered	a	serious	sales	depression	and	adjustment	.
Area	employment	dropped	by	13	%	from	its	1979	peak	and	retail	sales	were	down	14	%	.
However	,	the	real-estate	market	was	hurt	*-1	even	more	.
For	example	,	residential	building	permits	in	the	trough	year	of	1982	were	off	76	%	from	the	1979	peak	level	.
Once	metropolitan	Detroit	's	economy	rallied	in	the	mid-1980s	,	real	estate	rebounded	.
Building	permits	,	for	example	,	soared	a	staggering	400	%	between	1982	and	the	peak	year	of	1986	.
Where	,	savvy	corporations	and	professional	firms	are	now	asking	,	are	*T*-1	today	's	opportunities	?
*	Look	no	further	than	metropolitan	Houston	and	Denver	,	two	of	the	most	depressed	,	overbuilt	and	potentially	undervalued	real-estate	markets	in	the	nation	.
Of	course	,	some	observers	have	touted	Houston	and	Denver	for	the	past	five	years	as	a	counter-cyclical	play	.
But	now	appears	*-1	to	be	the	time	0	*	to	act	*T*-2	.
Metropolitan	Houston	's	economy	did	drop	and	then	flatten	in	the	years	after	its	1982	peak	.
In	the	mid-1980s	,	employment	was	down	as	much	as	5	%	from	the	1982	peak	and	retail	sales	were	off	13	%	.
The	real-estate	market	suffered	even	more	severe	setbacks	.
Office	construction	dropped	97	%	.
The	vacancy	rate	soared	more	than	20	%	in	nearly	every	product	category	,	and	more	than	30	%	of	office	space	was	vacant	.
To	some	observers	,	the	empty	office	buildings	of	Houston	's	``	see-through	skyline	''	were	indicative	of	a	very	troubled	economy	.
As	usual	,	the	real-estate	market	had	overreacted	.
Actually	,	the	region	's	economy	retained	a	firm	foundation	.
Metropolitan	Houston	's	population	has	held	*-1	steady	over	the	past	six	years	.
And	personal	income	,	after	*	slumping	in	the	mid-1980s	,	has	returned	to	its	1982	level	in	real	dollar	terms	.
Today	,	metropolitan	Houston	's	real-estate	market	is	poised	for	a	significant	turnaround	.
More	than	42,000	jobs	were	added	*-2	in	metro	Houston	last	year	,	primarily	in	biotechnology	,	petrochemical	processing	,	and	the	computer	industry	.
This	growth	puts	Houston	in	the	top	five	metro	areas	in	the	nation	last	year	.
And	forecasts	project	a	2.5	%	to	3	%	*U*	growth	rate	in	jobs	over	the	next	few	years	--	nearly	twice	the	national	average	.
Denver	is	another	metropolitan	area	where	the	commercial	real-estate	market	has	overreacted	to	the	region	's	economic	trends	*T*-1	,	although	Denver	has	not	experienced	as	severe	an	economic	downturn	as	Houston	.
By	some	measures	,	metropolitan	Denver	's	economy	has	actually	improved	in	the	past	four	years	.
Its	population	has	continued	*-1	to	increase	since	1983	,	the	peak	year	of	the	economic	cycle	.
Employment	is	now	4	%	higher	than	in	1983	.
Buying	income	in	real	dollars	actually	increased	15	%	between	1983	and	1987	-LRB-	the	most	recent	year	available	-RRB-	.
The	rates	of	increase	,	however	,	are	less	than	the	rapid	growth	of	the	boom	years	,	and	this	has	resulted	in	a	loss	of	confidence	in	the	economy	.
In	a	self-fulfilling	prophecy	,	therefore	,	the	region	's	real-estate	market	all	but	collapsed	in	recent	years	.
Housing	building	permits	are	down	more	than	75	%	from	their	1983	peaks	.
Although	no	one	can	predict	when	metropolitan	Denver	's	real-estate	market	will	rebound	*T*-1	,	major	public	works	projects	costing	several	billion	dollars	*ICH*-2	are	under	way	or	planned	*-3	--	such	as	a	new	convention	center	,	a	major	beltway	encircling	the	metropolitan	area	,	and	a	new	regional	airport	.
When	Denver	's	regional	economy	begins	*-1	to	grow	faster	*T*-2	--	such	a	recovery	could	occur	as	early	as	next	year	--	business	and	consumer	confidence	will	return	,	and	the	resulting	explosion	of	real-estate	activity	will	dwarf	the	general	economic	rebound	.
What	real-estate	strategy	should	one	follow	*T*-2	in	a	metropolitan	area	whose	economic	health	*T*-1	is	not	as	easy	0	*	to	determine	*T*-3	as	Houston	's	or	Denver	's	?
Generally	,	overcapacity	in	commercial	real	estate	is	dropping	from	its	mid-1980s	peak	,	even	in	such	economically	healthy	metropolitan	areas	as	Washington	,	New	York	and	Los	Angeles	.
Vacancy	rates	in	the	15	%	to	19	%	*U*	range	today	may	easily	rise	to	the	low	to	mid-20	%	range	in	a	couple	of	years	.
Under	these	conditions	,	even	a	flattening	out	of	economic	growth	--	``	*	catching	cold	''	--	in	the	healthy	metropolitan	areas	will	create	significant	opportunities	for	corporations	and	professional	service	firms	looking	for	bargains	as	the	realestate	industry	catches	pneumonia	.
Those	looking	for	real-estate	bargains	in	distressed	metropolitan	areas	should	lock	in	leases	or	buy	now	;	those	looking	in	healthy	metropolitan	areas	should	take	a	short-term	-LRB-	three-year	-RRB-	lease	and	wait	for	the	bargains	ahead	.
Mr.	Leinberger	is	managing	partner	of	a	real-estate	advisory	firm	based	*	in	Beverly	Hills	,	Calif	.
Kysor	Industrial	Corp.	said	0	it	expects	its	third-quarter	net	earnings	to	be	between	two	cents	and	four	cents	*U*	a	share	,	compared	with	61	cents	a	share	a	year	ago	.
Analysts	had	been	projecting	that	the	company	's	earnings	would	be	between	25	cents	and	30	cents	*U*	a	share	.
The	year-earlier	third-quarter	earnings	amounted	to	$	4.1	million	*U*	.
The	company	said	0	a	drop	in	activity	in	the	powerboat	industry	reduced	sales	volume	at	its	two	marine-related	operations	.
Also	,	the	company	said	0	its	commercial	products	operation	failed	*-1	to	meet	forecasts	.
Kysor	,	a	maker	of	heavy-duty	truck	and	commercial	refrigeration	equipment	,	said	0	it	expects	its	fourth-quarter	earnings	to	be	more	closely	in	line	with	usual	levels	,	which	*T*-1	are	between	30	cents	and	50	cents	*U*	a	share	.
Common	Cause	asked	both	the	Senate	Ethics	Committee	and	the	Justice	Department	*-2	to	investigate	$	1	million	*U*	in	political	gifts	by	Arizona	businessman	Charles	Keating	to	five	U.S.	senators	who	*T*-1	interceded	with	thrift-industry	regulators	for	him	.
Mr.	Keating	is	currently	the	subject	of	a	$	1.1	billion	*U*	federal	anti-racketeering	lawsuit	accusing	him	of	*	bleeding	off	assets	of	a	California	thrift	0	he	controlled	*T*-1	,	Lincoln	Savings	&	Loan	Association	,	and	driving	it	into	insolvency	.
Fred	Wertheimer	--	president	of	Common	Cause	,	the	self-styled	citizens	lobby	--	said	0	Mr.	Keating	already	has	conceded	*-1	attempting	*-2	to	buy	influence	with	the	lawmakers	--	Democratic	Sens.	Dennis	DeConcini	of	Arizona	,	Alan	Cranston	of	California	,	John	Glenn	of	Ohio	and	Donald	Riegle	of	Michigan	;	and	GOP	Sen.	John	McCain	of	Arizona	.
Mr.	Wertheimer	based	this	on	a	statement	by	Mr.	Keating	that	*T*-2	was	quoted	*-1	in	a	Wall	Street	Journal	story	in	April	:	``	One	question	...	had	*-3	to	do	with	whether	my	financial	support	in	any	way	influenced	several	political	figures	to	take	up	my	cause	.
I	want	*-1	to	say	in	the	most	forceful	way	0	I	can	*?*	*T*-2	:	0	I	certainly	hope	so	.	''
In	a	highly	unusual	meeting	in	Sen.	DeConcini	's	office	in	April	1987	,	the	five	senators	asked	federal	regulators	*-1	to	ease	up	on	Lincoln	.
According	to	notes	taken	*	by	one	of	the	participants	at	the	meeting	,	the	regulators	said	0	Lincoln	was	gambling	dangerously	with	depositors	'	federally	insured	money	and	was	``	a	ticking	time	bomb	.	''
Mr.	Keating	had	complained	that	the	regulators	were	being	too	zealous	.
The	notes	show	that	Sen.	DeConcini	called	the	Federal	Home	Loan	Bank	Board	's	regulations	``	grossly	unfair	,	''	and	that	Sen.	Glenn	insisted	that	Mr.	Keating	's	thrift	was	``	viable	and	profitable	.	''
For	the	next	two	years	,	the	Bank	Board	,	which	at	the	time	*T*-1	was	the	agency	responsible	for	*	regulating	thrifts	,	failed	*-2	to	act	--	even	after	federal	auditors	warned	in	May	1987	that	Mr.	Keating	had	caused	Lincoln	to	become	insolvent	.
Lincoln	's	parent	company	,	American	Continental	Corp.	,	entered	bankruptcy-law	proceedings	this	April	13	,	and	regulators	seized	the	thrift	the	next	day	.
The	newly	formed	Resolution	Trust	Corp.	,	successor	to	the	Bank	Board	,	filed	suit	against	Mr.	Keating	and	several	others	on	Sept.	15	.
Mr.	Keating	has	filed	his	own	suit	,	*	alleging	that	his	property	was	taken	*-1	illegally	.
The	cost	to	taxpayers	of	Lincoln	's	collapse	has	been	estimated	*-1	at	as	much	as	$	2.5	billion	*U*	.
Details	of	the	affair	have	become	public	gradually	over	the	past	two	years	,	mostly	as	a	result	of	reporting	by	several	newspapers	.
In	the	midst	of	his	1988	re-election	campaign	,	Sen.	Riegle	,	chairman	of	the	Senate	Banking	Committee	,	returned	$	76,000	*U*	in	contributions	after	a	Detroit	newspaper	said	that	Mr.	Keating	had	gathered	the	money	for	him	about	two	weeks	before	the	meeting	with	regulators	.
Sen.	DeConcini	,	after	months	of	*	fending	off	intense	press	criticism	,	returned	$	48,000	*U*	only	last	month	,	shortly	after	the	government	formally	accused	Mr.	Keating	of	*	defrauding	Lincoln	.
In	addition	,	Sen.	McCain	last	week	disclosed	that	he	belatedly	had	paid	$	13,433	*U*	to	American	Continental	as	reimbursement	for	trips	0	he	and	his	family	took	*T*-1	aboard	the	corporate	jet	to	Mr.	Keating	's	vacation	home	at	Cat	Cay	,	the	Bahamas	,	from	1984	through	1986	.
Sen.	McCain	said	0	he	had	meant	*-1	to	pay	for	the	trips	at	the	time	but	that	the	matter	``	fell	between	the	cracks	.	''
Mr.	Keating	,	his	family	members	and	associates	also	donated	$	112,000	*U*	to	Sen.	McCain	's	congressional	campaigns	over	the	years	,	according	to	press	accounts	.
But	Sen.	McCain	says	0	Mr.	Keating	broke	off	their	friendship	abruptly	in	1987	,	because	the	senator	refused	*-1	to	press	the	thrift	executive	's	case	as	vigorously	as	Mr.	Keating	wanted	*?*	.
``	He	became	very	angry	at	that	,	left	my	office	and	told	a	number	of	people	that	I	was	a	wimp	,	''	Sen.	McCain	recalls	*T*-1	.
In	July	,	California	newspapers	disclosed	that	Mr.	Keating	gave	$	850,000	*U*	in	corporate	funds	to	three	tax-exempt	voter	registration	organizations	in	1987	and	1988	at	the	behest	of	Sen.	Cranston	,	who	*T*-1	conceded	that	*	soliciting	the	money	was	``	a	pretty	stupid	thing	0	*	to	do	*T*-2	politically	.	''
In	addition	,	Sen.	Cranston	received	$	47,000	*U*	in	campaign	donations	through	Mr.	Keating	,	and	the	California	Democratic	party	received	$	85,000	*U*	in	corporate	donations	for	a	1986	get-out-the-vote	drive	that	*T*-1	benefited	the	senator	's	re-election	campaign	that	year	.
Also	in	July	,	Ohio	newspapers	disclosed	$	200,000	*U*	in	corporate	donations	by	Mr.	Keating	to	the	National	Council	on	Public	Policy	,	a	political	committee	controlled	*	by	Sen.	Glenn	.
That	was	in	addition	to	$	34,000	*U*	in	direct	campaign	donations	arranged	*	by	Mr.	Keating	to	the	Ohio	senator	.
Mr.	Wertheimer	said	0	the	Senate	Ethics	Committee	should	hire	a	special	outside	counsel	*-2	to	conduct	an	investigation	,	as	*	was	done	in	the	case	of	former	House	Speaker	James	Wright	.
Wilson	Abney	,	staff	director	of	the	ethics	panel	,	would	n't	comment	.
Sen.	Riegle	said	0	he	would	cooperate	with	any	inquiry	,	but	that	his	conduct	had	been	``	entirely	proper	.	''
Sen.	McCain	said	0	he	had	been	``	deeply	concerned	*ICH*-2	''	at	the	time	of	the	meeting	that	it	might	seem	*-1	to	be	improper	,	but	decided	0	it	was	``	entirely	appropriate	''	for	him	to	seek	fair	treatment	for	a	constituent	.
Sen.	Glenn	said	0	he	had	already	made	a	complete	disclosure	of	his	role	in	the	affair	and	``	I	am	completely	satisfied	*	to	let	this	matter	rest	in	the	hands	of	the	Senate	Ethics	Committee	.	''
Sen.	DeConcini	said	,	``	When	all	is	said	and	done	*T*-2	,	I	expect	*-3	to	be	fully	exonerated	*-1	.	''
Sen.	Cranston	,	who	*T*-1	had	already	volunteered	his	help	to	the	Federal	Bureau	of	Investigation	in	any	investigation	of	Mr.	Keating	,	portrayed	his	role	in	1987	as	*	prodding	regulators	to	act	.
``	Why	did	n't	the	Bank	Board	act	sooner	*T*-2	?	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
``	That	is	what	Common	Cause	should	ask	0	*T*-2	be	investigated	*-1	.
Trinity	Industries	Inc.	said	0	it	reached	a	preliminary	agreement	*	to	manufacture	1,000	coal	rail	cars	for	Norfolk	Southern	Corp	.
Trinity	estimated	the	value	of	the	pact	at	more	than	$	40	million	*U*	.
Trinity	said	0	it	plans	*-1	to	begin	delivery	of	the	rail	cars	in	the	first	quarter	of	1990	.
It	said	0	the	1,000	rail	cars	are	in	addition	to	the	1,450	coal	rail	cars	presently	being	produced	for	Norfolk	Southern	,	a	Norfolk	,	Va.-based	railroad	concern	.
When	China	opened	its	doors	to	foreign	investors	in	1979	*T*-1	,	toy	makers	from	Hong	Kong	were	among	the	first	0	*T*-2	to	march	in	.
Today	,	with	about	75	%	of	the	companies	'	products	being	made	*-1	in	China	,	the	chairman	of	the	Hong	Kong	Toys	Council	,	Dennis	Ting	,	has	suggested	a	new	sourcing	label	:	``	Made	*	in	China	by	Hong	Kong	Companies	.	''
The	toy	makers	were	pushed	*-1	across	the	border	by	rising	labor	and	land	costs	in	the	British	colony	.
But	in	the	wake	of	the	shootings	in	Beijing	on	June	4	,	the	Hong	Kong	toy	industry	is	worrying	about	its	strong	dependence	on	China	.
Although	the	manufacturers	stress	that	production	has	n't	been	affected	*-1	by	China	's	political	turmoil	,	they	are	looking	for	additional	sites	.
The	toy	makers	,	and	their	foreign	buyers	,	cite	uncertainty	about	China	's	economic	and	political	policies	.
``	Nobody	wants	*-2	to	have	all	his	eggs	in	one	basket	,	''	says	*T*-1	David	Yeh	,	chairman	and	chief	executive	officer	of	International	Matchbox	Group	Ltd	.
Indeed	,	Matchbox	and	other	leading	Hong	Kong	toy	makers	were	setting	up	factories	in	Southeast	Asia	,	especially	in	Thailand	,	long	before	the	massacre	.
Their	steps	were	partly	prompted	*-1	by	concern	over	a	deterioration	of	business	conditions	in	southern	China	.
By	*	diversifying	supply	sources	,	the	toy	makers	do	n't	intend	*-1	to	withdraw	from	China	,	manufacturers	and	foreign	buyers	say	0	*T*-2	.
It	*EXP*-1	would	n't	be	easy	*	to	duplicate	quickly	the	manufacturing	capacity	built	up	in	southern	China	during	the	past	decade	.
A	supply	of	cheap	labor	and	the	access	to	Hong	Kong	's	port	,	airport	,	banks	and	support	industries	,	such	as	printing	companies	,	have	made	China	's	Guangdong	province	a	premier	manufacturing	site	.
``	South	China	is	the	most	competitive	source	of	toys	in	the	world	,	''	says	*T*-1	Henry	Hu	,	executive	director	of	Wah	Shing	Toys	Consolidated	Ltd	.
Hong	Kong	trade	figures	illustrate	the	toy	makers	'	reliance	on	factories	across	the	border	.
In	1988	,	exports	of	domestically	produced	toys	and	games	fell	19	%	from	1987	,	to	HK$	10.05	billion	*U*	-LRB-	US$	1.29	billion	*U*	-RRB-	.
But	re-exports	,	mainly	from	China	,	jumped	75	%	,	to	HK$	15.92	billion	*U*	.
In	1989	's	first	seven	months	,	domestic	exports	fell	29	%	,	to	HK$	3.87	billion	*U*	,	while	re-exports	rose	56	%	,	to	HK$	11.28	billion	*U*	.
Manufacturers	say	0	there	is	no	immediate	substitute	for	southern	China	,	where	an	estimated	120,000	people	are	employed	*-1	by	the	toy	industry	*T*-2	.
``	For	the	next	few	years	,	*	like	it	or	not	,	China	is	going	*-1	to	be	the	main	supplier	,	''	says	*T*-2	Edmund	Young	,	vice	president	of	Perfecta	Enterprises	Ltd.	,	one	of	the	first	big	Hong	Kong	toy	makers	0	*T*-3	to	move	across	the	border	.
In	the	meantime	,	as	manufacturers	and	buyers	seek	new	sites	,	they	are	focusing	mainly	on	Southeast	Asia	.
Several	big	companies	have	established	manufacturing	joint	ventures	in	Thailand	,	including	Matchbox	,	Wah	Shing	and	Kader	Industrial	Co.	,	the	toy	manufacturer	headed	*	by	Mr.	Ting	.
Malaysia	,	the	Philippines	and	Indonesia	also	are	being	studied	*-1	.
With	the	European	Community	set	*-1	to	remove	its	internal	trade	barriers	in	1992	,	several	Hong	Kong	companies	are	beginning	*-2	to	consider	Spain	,	Portugal	and	Greece	as	possible	manufacturing	sites	.
Worries	about	China	came	just	as	Hong	Kong	's	toy	industry	was	recovering	from	a	1987	sales	slump	and	bankruptcy	filings	by	two	major	U.S.	companies	,	Worlds	of	Wonder	Inc.	and	Coleco	Industries	Inc	.
Hong	Kong	manufacturers	say	0	large	debt	writeoffs	and	other	financial	problems	resulting	from	the	1987	difficulties	chastened	the	local	industry	,	*	causing	it	to	tighten	credit	policies	and	financial	management	.
The	industry	regards	last	year	and	this	year	as	a	period	of	recovery	that	*T*-1	will	lead	to	improved	results	.
Still	,	they	long	for	a	``	mega-hit	''	toy	to	excite	retail	sales	in	the	U.S.	,	Hong	Kong	's	biggest	market	for	toys	and	games	.
The	closest	thing	0	the	colony	's	companies	have	*T*-1	to	a	U.S.	mega-hit	this	year	is	the	Teenage	Mutant	Ninja	Turtles	series	of	action	figures	manufactured	*	by	Playmates	Holdings	Ltd	.
*-1989	Introduced	in	mid-1988	,	the	15-centimeter-tall	plastic	turtles	are	based	*-1989	on	an	American	comic	book	and	television	series	.
Paul	Kwan	,	managing	director	of	Playmates	,	says	0	10	million	Ninja	Turtles	have	been	sold	*-1	,	*	placing	the	reptilian	warriors	among	the	10	biggest-selling	toys	in	the	U.S.	.
Should	sales	continue	*-2	to	be	strong	through	the	Christmas	season	,	which	*T*-1	accounts	for	about	60	%	of	U.S.	retail	toy	sales	,	Mr.	Kwan	said	0	the	Ninja	Turtles	could	make	1989	a	record	sales	year	for	Playmates	.
Other	Hong	Kong	manufacturers	expect	their	results	to	improve	only	slightly	this	year	from	1988	.
Besides	the	lack	of	a	fast-selling	product	,	they	cite	the	continued	dominance	of	the	U.S.	market	by	Nintendo	Entertainment	System	,	an	expensive	video	game	made	*	by	Nintendo	Co.	of	Japan	.
Nintendo	buyers	have	little	money	left	*	to	spend	on	other	products	.
Many	of	the	toy	makers	'	problems	started	well	before	June	4	as	a	result	of	overstrained	infrastructure	and	Beijing	's	austerity	programs	launched	*	late	last	year	.
Toy	makers	complain	that	electricity	in	Guangdong	has	been	provided	*-1	only	three	days	a	week	in	recent	months	,	down	from	five	days	a	week	,	as	the	province	's	rapid	industrialization	has	outstripped	its	generating	capacity	.
Manufacturers	are	upgrading	standby	power	plants	.
Bank	credit	for	China	investments	all	but	dried	up	following	June	4	.
Also	,	concern	exists	that	the	harder-line	Beijing	leadership	will	tighten	its	control	of	Guangdong	,	which	*T*-1	has	been	the	main	laboratory	for	the	open-door	policy	and	economic	reforms	.
But	,	toy	manufacturers	and	other	industrialists	say	0	Beijing	will	be	restrained	*-1	from	*	tightening	controls	on	export-oriented	southern	China	.
They	say	0	China	's	trade	deficit	is	widening	and	the	country	is	too	short	*ICH*-1	of	foreign	exchange	for	it	to	hamper	production	in	Guangdong	.
``	The	Chinese	leaders	have	*-1	to	decide	whether	they	want	control	or	whether	the	want	exports	,	''	says	*T*-2	Mr.	Kwan	of	Playmates	.
The	Bush	administration	,	*-1	urging	the	Supreme	Court	*-2	to	give	states	more	leeway	*	to	restrict	abortions	,	said	0	minors	have	n't	any	right	to	abortion	without	the	consent	of	their	parents	.
Solicitor	General	Kenneth	Starr	argued	that	the	1973	Supreme	Court	decision	,	Roe	vs.	Wade	,	recognizing	a	constitutional	right	to	abortion	,	was	incorrect	.
He	also	argued	that	the	high	court	was	wrong	in	1976	*	to	rule	that	minors	have	a	right	to	abortion	that	*T*-2	ca	n't	be	absolutely	vetoed	*-1	by	their	parents	.
The	administration	's	position	was	outlined	*-1	in	a	friend-of-the-court	brief	filed	*	in	one	of	three	abortion	cases	0	the	Supreme	Court	will	hear	*T*-2	argued	and	will	decide	*T*-2	this	term	.
The	administration	filed	the	brief	in	an	appeal	involving	a	Minnesota	law	that	*T*-2	requires	that	both	parents	of	a	minor	be	notified	*-1	before	she	may	have	an	abortion	.
The	administration	urged	the	justices	*-1	to	adopt	a	legal	standard	suggested	*	by	Chief	Justice	William	Rehnquist	last	July	when	the	high	court	upheld	Missouri	's	abortion	restrictions	*T*-2	.
Under	that	standard	,	which	*T*-1	garnered	the	votes	of	only	three	of	the	nine	justices	,	a	state	restriction	of	abortion	is	constitutional	if	the	state	has	a	``	reasonable	''	justification	for	*	adopting	it	.
That	is	a	much	easier	standard	0	for	a	state	to	satisfy	*T*-2	than	the	Supreme	Court	's	test	since	1973	,	which	*T*-1	requires	a	state	to	have	a	``	compelling	''	reason	for	*	restricting	abortion	.
On	the	provisions	of	the	Minnesota	law	,	the	Bush	administration	said	that	*	requiring	that	both	parents	be	notified	*-1	is	a	reasonable	regulation	,	and	that	there	is	no	need	*	to	have	an	alternative	that	*T*-2	allows	minors	to	go	to	court	for	a	judge	's	permission	instead	.
The	case	,	Hodgson	vs.	Minnesota	,	will	be	argued	*-1	Nov.	29	.
Aluminum	Co.	of	America	,	hit	hard	by	the	strength	of	the	dollar	overseas	,	said	0	net	income	for	the	third	quarter	dropped	3.2	%	to	$	219	million	*U*	,	or	$	2.46	*U*	a	share	.
The	nation	's	No.	1	aluminum	maker	earned	$	226.3	million	*U*	,	or	$	2.56	*U*	a	share	,	a	year	earlier	.
Revenue	rose	11	%	to	$	2.83	billion	*U*	from	$	2.56	billion	*U*	.
Analysts	,	who	*T*-1	were	expecting	Alcoa	to	post	around	$	2.70	to	$	3	*U*	a	share	,	were	surprised	at	the	lackluster	third-quarter	results	.
``	It	's	disappointing	,	''	said	*T*-1	William	Siedenburg	,	an	analyst	with	Smith	Barney	,	Harris	Upham	&	Co	.
Much	of	the	earnings	decline	was	led	*-1	by	currency-exchange	rate	adjustments	,	which	*T*-2	affected	the	bottom	line	by	$	15.3	million	*U*	,	or	17	cents	a	share	,	compared	with	$	3.6	million	*U*	,	or	four	cents	a	share	,	the	previous	year	.
Lower	prices	for	aluminum	ingots	and	certain	alloy	products	and	a	shift	in	the	product	mix	also	contributed	to	lower	earnings	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-1	.
``	In	addition	,	costs	were	higher	partly	due	to	scheduled	plant	outages	for	modernization	work	,	''	the	company	said	*T*-1	.
Excluding	the	higher	tax	rate	,	which	*T*-1	rose	two	percentage	points	to	38	%	,	and	the	negative	exchange	rate	adjustment	,	the	company	would	have	met	analysts	'	expectations	,	said	*T*-2	R.	Wayne	Atwell	,	an	analyst	with	Goldman	,	Sachs	&	Co	.
*-2	Noting	that	the	third	quarter	is	usually	the	aluminum	industry	's	slowest	,	Mr.	Atwell	added	,	``	the	third	quarter	is	never	a	bang	up	period	for	them	anyway	.	''
Nevertheless	,	the	company	said	0	shipments	were	up	slightly	to	679,000	metric	tons	from	671,000	,	*	buffing	the	impact	of	the	unexpected	earning	decline	.
The	results	were	announced	*-1	after	the	stock	market	closed	.
In	New	York	Stock	Exchange	composite	trading	Friday	,	Alcoa	closed	at	$	72	*U*	a	share	,	down	$	4.75	*U*	,	in	a	sharply	lower	market	.
For	20	years	,	federal	rules	have	barred	the	three	major	television	networks	from	*	sharing	in	one	of	the	most	lucrative	and	fastest-growing	parts	of	the	television	business	.
And	for	six	years	,	NBC	,	ABC	and	CBS	have	negotiated	with	Hollywood	studios	in	a	futile	attempt	*	to	change	that	.
But	with	foreign	companies	snapping	up	U.S.	movie	studios	,	the	networks	are	pressing	their	fight	harder	than	ever	.
They	hope	0	the	foreign	deals	will	divide	the	Hollywood	opposition	and	prod	Congress	to	push	for	*	ending	federal	rules	that	*T*-1	prohibit	the	networks	from	*-3	grabbing	a	piece	of	rerun	sales	and	owning	part	of	the	shows	0	they	put	*T*-2	on	the	air	.
Even	network	executives	,	however	,	admit	privately	that	victory	--	either	in	Congress	or	in	talks	with	the	studios	--	is	highly	doubtful	any	time	soon	.
And	so	the	networks	also	are	pushing	for	new	ways	0	*	to	sidestep	the	``	fin-syn	''	provisions	,	known	*	formally	as	the	Financial	Interest	and	Syndication	Rules	*T*-1	.
That	became	clear	last	week	with	the	disclosure	that	National	Broadcasting	Co.	,	backed	*	by	the	deep	pockets	of	parent	General	Electric	Co.	,	had	tried	*-1	to	help	*-2	fund	Qintex	Australia	Ltd.	's	now-scuttled	$	1.5	billion	*U*	bid	for	MGM\/UA	Communications	Co	.
NBC	's	interest	may	revive	the	deal	,	which	MGM\/UA	killed	*T*-1	last	week	when	the	Australian	concern	had	trouble	*-3	raising	cash	*T*-2	.
Even	if	that	deal	is	n't	revived	*-1	,	NBC	hopes	*-2	to	find	another	.
``	Our	doors	are	open	,	''	an	NBC	spokesman	says	*T*-1	.
NBC	may	yet	find	a	way	0	*	to	take	a	passive	,	minority	interest	in	a	program-maker	without	*	violating	the	rules	*T*-1	.
And	any	NBC	effort	could	prompt	CBS	Inc.	and	ABC	's	parent	,	Capital	Cities\/ABC	Inc.	,	to	look	for	ways	of	*	skirting	the	fin-syn	regulations	.
But	the	networks	'	push	may	only	aggravate	an	increasingly	bitter	rift	between	them	and	Hollywood	studios	.
Both	sides	are	*-1	to	sit	down	next	month	for	yet	another	meeting	on	how	they	might	agree	on	*	reducing	fin-syn	restraints	*T*-2	.
Few	people	privy	to	the	talks	expect	the	studios	to	budge	.
The	networks	still	are	``	uninhibited	in	their	authority	''	over	what	shows	*T*-1	get	on	the	air	,	charges	Motion	Picture	Association	President	Jack	Valenti	,	the	most	vociferous	opponent	of	*	rescinding	the	rules	.
Studios	are	``	powerless	''	*	to	get	shows	in	prime-time	lineups	and	keep	them	there	long	enough	*	to	go	into	lucrative	rerun	sales	,	he	contends	0	*T*-1	.
And	that	's	why	the	rules	,	for	the	most	part	,	must	stay	in	place	*T*-1	,	he	says	0	*T*-2	.
Studio	executives	in	on	the	talks	-	including	officials	at	Paramount	Communications	Inc.	,	Fries	Entertainment	Inc.	,	Warner	Communications	Inc.	and	MCA	Inc.	--	declined	*-2	to	be	interviewed	*-1	.
But	Mr.	Valenti	,	who	*T*-1	represents	the	studios	,	asserts	:	``	0	The	whole	production	industry	,	to	a	man	,	is	on	the	side	of	*	preserving	''	the	rules	.
Such	proclamations	leave	network	officials	all	the	more	doubtful	that	the	studios	will	bend	.
``	They	do	n't	seem	*-1	to	have	an	incentive	*	to	negotiate	,	''	says	*T*-2	one	network	executive	.
``	And	there	's	no	indication	that	Washington	is	prepared	*	to	address	the	rules	.
That	's	the	problem	,	is	n't	it	*?*	?	''
Indeed	it	is	*?*	.
Congress	has	said	repeatedly	0	it	wants	no	part	of	the	mess	,	*-2	urging	the	studios	and	the	networks	,	which	*T*-1	license	rights	to	air	shows	made	*	by	the	studios	,	*-3	to	work	out	their	own	compromise	.
But	recent	developments	have	made	the	networks	--	and	NBC	President	Robert	Wright	,	in	particular	--	ever	more	adamant	that	the	networks	must	be	unshackled	*	to	survive	.
The	latest	provocation	:	Sony	Corp.	's	plan	*	to	acquire	Columbia	Pictures	Entertainment	Inc.	for	$	3.4	billion	*U*	,	and	*	to	buy	independent	producer	Guber	Peters	Entertainment	Co.	for	$	200	million	*U*	.
``	I	wonder	what	Walter	Cronkite	will	think	of	the	Sony\/Columbia	Broadcast	System	Trinitron	Evening	News	with	Dan	Rather	broadcast	*	exclusively	from	Tokyo	,	''	wrote	*T*-1	J.B.	Holston	,	an	NBC	vice	president	,	in	a	commentary	in	last	week	's	issue	of	Broadcasting	magazine	.
In	his	article	,	Mr.	Holston	,	who	*T*-1	was	in	Europe	last	week	and	unavailable	,	complained	that	the	``	archaic	restraints	''	in	fin-syn	rules	have	``	contributed	directly	to	the	acquisition	of	the	studios	by	non-U.S.	enterprises	.
''	-LRB-	He	did	n't	mention	that	NBC	,	in	the	meantime	,	was	hoping	*-1	to	assist	Australia	's	Qintex	in	buying
An	NBC	spokesman	counters	that	Mr.	Holston	's	lament	was	``	entirely	consistent	''	with	NBC	plans	because	the	U.S.	rules	would	limit	NBC	's	involvement	in	the	Qintex	deal	so	severely	as	*	to	be	``	light	years	away	from	the	type	of	unrestrained	deals	available	to	Sony	--	and	everyone	else	except	the	three	networks	.	''
The	Big	Three	's	drumbeat	for	deregulation	began	*-1	intensifying	in	the	summer	when	the	former	Time	Inc.	went	ahead	with	plans	*-3	to	acquire	Warner	*T*-2	.
Although	Time	already	had	a	long-term	contract	*	to	buy	movies	from	Warner	,	the	merger	will	let	Time	's	largely	unregulated	pay-cable	channel	,	Home	Box	Office	,	own	the	Warner	movies	aired	*	on	HBO	--	a	vertical	integration	that	*T*-2	is	effectively	blocked	*-1	by	fin-syn	regulations	.
NBC	's	Mr.	Wright	led	the	way	in	*	decrying	the	networks	'	inability	*	to	match	a	Time-Warner	combination	.
He	spoke	up	again	when	the	Sony	bid	for	Columbia	was	announced	*-1	*T*-2	.
Since	NBC	's	interest	in	the	Qintex	bid	for	MGM\/UA	was	disclosed	*-1	,	Mr.	Wright	has	n't	been	available	for	comment	.
With	a	Qintex	deal	,	NBC	would	move	into	uncharted	territory	--	*	possibly	raising	hackles	at	the	studios	and	in	Washington	.
``	It	's	never	really	been	tested	*-1	,	''	says	*T*-2	William	Lilley	III	,	who	as	a	top	CBS	executive	*T*-3	spent	years	*-4	lobbying	*	to	have	the	rules	lifted	.
He	now	runs	Policy	Communications	in	Washington	,	*	consulting	to	media	companies	.
Fin-syn	rules	do	n't	explicitly	block	a	network	from	*	buying	a	passive	,	small	stake	in	a	company	that	*T*-1	profits	from	the	rerun	syndication	0	networks	ca	n't	enjoy	*T*-2	.
Hence	,	NBC	might	be	able	*	to	take	,	*	say	,	a	5	%	stake	in	a	company	such	as	MGM\/UA	.
If	the	transaction	raised	objections	,	the	studio	's	syndication	operations	could	be	spun	off	into	a	separate	firm	in	which	the	network	does	n't	have	a	direct	stake	*T*-1	.
But	such	convolutions	would	still	block	the	networks	from	*-1	grabbing	a	big	chunk	of	the	riches	of	syndication	.
Under	current	rules	,	even	when	a	network	fares	well	with	a	100%-owned	series	--	ABC	,	for	example	,	made	a	killing	in	*-2	broadcasting	its	popular	crime\/comedy	``	Moonlighting	''	--	*T*-5	it	is	n't	allowed	*-3	to	share	in	the	continuing	proceeds	when	the	reruns	are	sold	*-1	to	local	stations	*T*-4	.
Instead	,	ABC	will	have	*-1	to	sell	off	the	rights	for	a	one-time	fee	.
The	networks	admit	that	the	chances	of	*	getting	the	relief	0	they	want	*T*-1	are	slim	--	for	several	years	at	the	least	.
Six	years	ago	they	were	tantalizingly	close	.
The	Reagan-era	Federal	Communications	Commission	had	ruled	in	favor	of	*	killing	most	of	the	rules	.
Various	evidence	,	including	a	Brookings	Institution	study	of	some	800	series	that	the	networks	had	aired	*T*-2	and	had	partly	owned	*T*-2	in	the	1960s	,	showed	0	the	networks	did	n't	wield	undue	control	over	the	studios	as	*	had	been	alleged	*-1	.
But	just	eight	days	before	the	rules	were	*	to	die	,	former	President	Ronald	Reagan	,	a	one-time	actor	,	intervened	on	behalf	of	Hollywood	.
The	FCC	effort	collapsed	.
The	networks	and	studios	have	bickered	ever	since	.
Network	officials	involved	*	in	the	studio	talks	may	hope	0	the	foreign	influx	builds	more	support	in	Washington	,	but	that	seems	unlikely	.
In	Congress	,	the	issue	falters	:	It	's	about	money	,	not	program	quality	,	and	Hollywood	has	lots	of	clout	given	its	fund	raising	for	senators	and	representatives	overseeing	the	issue	.
A	spokesman	for	Rep.	Edward	J.	Markey	-LRB-	D-Mass.	-RRB-	,	who	*T*-2	heads	a	subcommittee	that	*T*-3	oversees	the	FCC	,	says	0	Mr.	Markey	feels	``	0	the	world	has	been	forever	changed	*-1	by	the	Sony-Columbia	deal	.	''
But	he	said	0	Mr.	Markey	hopes	0	this	pushes	the	networks	and	studios	to	work	it	out	on	their	own	.
And	at	the	FCC	,	meanwhile	,	new	Chairman	Alfred	C.	Sikes	has	said	0	he	wants	the	two	sides	to	hammer	out	their	own	plan	.
Recognition	Equipment	Inc.	said	0	it	settled	a	civil	action	filed	*	against	it	by	the	federal	government	on	behalf	of	the	U.S.	Postal	Service	.
The	government	sued	the	company	in	April	,	*	seeking	$	23,000	*U*	and	other	unspecified	damages	related	*	to	an	alleged	contract-steering	scheme	.
The	suit	named	the	company	,	former	chief	executive	officer	William	G.	Moore	Jr.	,	former	vice	president	Robert	W.	Reedy	and	five	defendants	who	*T*-1	were	n't	part	of	the	company	.
The	suit	charged	the	defendants	with	*	causing	Peter	E.	Voss	,	an	ex-member	of	the	Postal	Service	board	of	governors	,	to	accept	$	23,000	*U*	in	bribes	,	kickbacks	and	gratuities	.
Mr.	Voss	was	previously	sentenced	to	four	years	in	prison	and	fined	$	11,000	*U*	for	his	role	in	the	scheme	.
In	the	agreement	,	Recognition	agreed	*-1	to	pay	the	government	$	20,000	*U*	in	return	for	the	release	of	all	claims	against	the	company	,	Mr.	Moore	and	Mr.	Reedy	.
The	five	additional	defendants	were	n't	parties	to	the	settlement	.
A	trial	on	criminal	allegations	against	the	company	and	the	same	two	former	executives	began	Sept.	27	in	federal	court	for	the	District	of	Columbia	.
They	were	indicted	*-1	last	October	on	charges	of	fraud	,	theft	and	conspiracy	related	*	to	an	effort	*	to	win	$	400	million	*U*	in	Postal	Service	equipment	contracts	by	the	maker	of	data	management	equipment	.
The	company	and	its	executives	deny	the	charges	.
In	a	related	development	,	Recognition	Equipment	said	0	the	Postal	Service	has	barred	the	company	from	*	bidding	on	postal	contracts	for	an	additional	120	days	.
The	Postal	Service	originally	suspended	the	company	Oct.	7	,	1988	,	and	has	been	renewing	the	ban	ever	since	.
The	company	said	0	it	will	continue	*-1	to	pursue	a	lifting	of	the	suspension	.
Intel	Corp.	reported	a	50	%	drop	in	third-quarter	net	income	,	partly	because	of	a	one-time	charge	for	discontinued	operations	.
The	big	semiconductor	and	computer	maker	,	said	0	it	had	net	of	$	72	million	*U*	,	or	38	cents	,	down	50	%	from	$	142.7	million	*U*	,	or	78	cents	a	share	.
The	lower	net	included	a	charge	of	$	35	million	*U*	,	equal	to	12	cents	a	share	on	an	after-tax	basis	,	for	the	cost	of	*	abandoning	a	computer-systems	joint	venture	with	Siemens	AG	of	West	Germany	.
Earning	also	fell	from	the	year-ago	period	because	of	slowing	microchip	demand	.
Sales	amounted	to	$	771.4	million	*U*	,	down	1.7	%	from	$	784.9	million	*U*	.
Intel	's	stock	rose	in	early	over-the-counter	trading	Friday	,	as	investors	appeared	relieved	that	the	company	's	income	from	continuing	operations	was	only	slightly	below	the	second	quarter	's	earnings	of	$	99.3	million	*U*	,	or	53	cents	a	share	,	and	that	sales	actually	exceeded	the	$	747.3	million	*U*	for	the	second	period	.
But	Intel	later	succumbed	to	the	stock	market	's	plunge	,	*	closing	at	$	31.75	*U*	,	down	$	2.125	*U*	.
In	August	,	Intel	warned	that	third-quarter	earnings	might	be	``	flat	to	down	''	from	the	previous	period	's	because	of	slowing	sales	growth	of	its	80386	microprocessor	,	start-up	costs	associated	*	with	a	line	of	computers	and	costs	of	*	preparing	for	mass	shipments	of	the	company	's	new	80486	chip	in	the	current	quarter	.
On	Friday	,	Andrew	S.Grove	,	Intel	president	and	chief	executive	officer	,	said	0	``	Intel	's	business	is	strong	.
Our	bookings	improved	as	the	quarter	progressed	and	September	was	especially	good	.
For	the	full	quarter	,	our	bookings	were	higher	than	the	previous	quarter	,	and	our	book-to-bill	ratio	exceeded	1.0	.	''
For	the	nine-month	period	,	Intel	reported	net	of	$	268.3	million	*U*	,	or	$	1.43	*U*	a	share	,	down	27	%	from	$	367.1	million	*U*	,	or	$	2.05	*U*	a	share	.

Walter	Sisulu	and	the	African	National	Congress	came	home	yesterday	.
After	26	years	in	prison	,	Mr.	Sisulu	,	the	77-year-old	former	secretary-general	of	the	liberation	movement	,	was	dropped	*-1	off	at	his	house	by	a	prison	services	'	van	just	as	the	sun	was	coming	up	.
At	the	same	time	,	six	ANC	colleagues	,	five	of	whom	*T*-2	were	arrested	*-3	with	him	in	1963	and	sentenced	*-3	to	life	imprisonment	,	were	reunited	*-1	with	their	families	at	various	places	around	the	country	.
And	as	the	graying	men	returned	to	their	homes	,	the	ANC	,	outlawed	in	South	Africa	since	1960	and	still	considered	*	to	be	the	chief	public	enemy	by	the	white	government	,	defiantly	returned	to	the	streets	of	the	country	's	black	townships	.
A	huge	ANC	flag	,	with	black	,	green	and	gold	stripes	,	was	hoisted	*-1	over	the	rickety	gate	at	Mr.	Sisulu	's	modest	house	,	while	on	the	street	out	front	,	boys	displayed	the	ANC	colors	on	their	shirts	,	caps	and	scarves	.
At	the	small	four-room	home	of	Elias	Motsoaledi	,	a	leading	ANC	unionist	and	a	former	commander	in	the	group	's	armed	wing	,	Umkhonto	we	Sizwe	,	well-wishers	stuck	little	ANC	flags	in	their	hair	and	a	man	tooted	on	an	antelope	horn	wrapped	*	in	ANC	ribbons	.
``	I	am	happy	*	to	see	the	spirit	of	the	people	,	''	said	*T*-1	Mr.	Sisulu	,	*	looking	dapper	in	a	new	gray	suit	.
As	the	crowd	outside	his	home	shouted	``	ANC	,	ANC	,	''	the	old	man	shot	his	fists	into	the	air	.
``	I	'm	inspired	*-1	by	the	mood	of	the	people	.	''
Under	the	laws	of	the	land	,	the	ANC	remains	an	illegal	organization	,	and	its	headquarters	are	still	in	Lusaka	,	Zambia	.
But	the	unconditional	release	of	the	seven	leaders	,	who	*T*-1	once	formed	the	intellectual	and	organizational	core	of	the	ANC	,	is	a	de	facto	unbanning	of	the	movement	and	the	rebirth	of	its	internal	wing	.
``	The	government	can	never	put	the	ANC	back	into	the	bottle	again	,	''	said	*T*-1	Cassim	Saloojee	,	a	veteran	anti-apartheid	activist	on	hand	*	to	welcome	Mr.	Sisulu	.
``	Things	have	gone	too	far	for	the	government	to	stop	them	now	.
There	's	no	*	turning	back	.	''
There	was	certainly	no	*	stopping	the	tide	of	ANC	emotion	last	night	,	when	hundreds	of	people	jammed	into	the	Holy	Cross	Anglican	Church	in	Soweto	for	what	*T*-1	became	the	first	ANC	rally	in	the	country	in	30	years	*T*-2	.
Deafening	chants	of	``	ANC	''	and	``	Umkhonto	we	Sizwe	''	shook	the	church	as	the	seven	aging	men	vowed	that	the	ANC	would	continue	its	fight	against	the	government	and	the	policies	of	racial	segregation	on	all	fronts	,	including	the	armed	struggle	.
And	they	called	on	the	government	*-2	to	release	Nelson	Mandela	,	the	ANC	's	leading	figure	,	who	*T*-1	was	jailed	with	them	and	remains	in	prison	.
Without	him	,	said	0	*T*-1	Mr.	Sisulu	,	the	freeing	of	the	others	``	is	only	a	half-measure	.	''
President	F.W.	de	Klerk	released	the	ANC	men	--	along	with	one	of	the	founding	members	of	the	Pan	Africanist	Congress	,	a	rival	liberation	group	--	as	part	of	his	efforts	*	to	create	a	climate	of	trust	and	peace	in	which	his	government	can	begin	negotiations	with	black	leaders	over	a	new	constitution	aimed	*	at	*	giving	blacks	a	voice	in	national	government	*T*-1	.
But	Pretoria	may	instead	be	creating	a	climate	for	more	turmoil	and	uncertainty	in	this	racially	divided	country	.
As	other	repressive	governments	,	particularly	Poland	and	the	Soviet	Union	,	have	recently	discovered	,	initial	steps	*	to	open	up	society	can	create	a	momentum	for	radical	change	that	*T*-1	becomes	difficult	*RNR*-2	,	if	not	impossible	*RNR*-2	,	*	to	control	.
As	the	days	go	by	,	the	South	African	government	will	be	ever	more	hard	pressed	*	to	justify	the	continued	imprisonment	of	Mr.	Mandela	as	well	as	the	continued	banning	of	the	ANC	and	enforcement	of	the	state	of	emergency	.
If	it	does	n't	yield	on	these	matters	,	and	eventually	begin	talking	directly	to	the	ANC	,	the	expectations	and	promise	raised	*	by	yesterday	's	releases	will	turn	to	disillusionment	and	unrest	.
If	it	does	,	the	large	number	of	right-wing	whites	,	who	*T*-1	oppose	any	concessions	to	the	black	majority	,	will	step	up	their	agitation	and	threats	*	to	take	matters	into	their	own	hands	.
The	newly	released	ANC	leaders	also	will	be	under	enormous	pressure	.
The	government	is	watching	closely	*	to	see	if	their	presence	in	the	townships	leads	to	increased	anti-government	protests	and	violence	;	if	it	does	,	Pretoria	will	use	this	as	a	reason	0	*	to	keep	Mr.	Mandela	behind	bars	*T*-1	.
Pretoria	has	n't	forgotten	why	they	were	all	sentenced	to	life	imprisonment	in	the	first	place	:	for	sabotage	and	conspiracy	to	overthrow	the	government	.
In	addition	,	the	government	is	figuring	that	the	releases	could	create	a	split	between	the	internal	and	external	wings	of	the	ANC	and	between	the	newly	freed	leaders	and	those	activists	who	*T*-1	have	emerged	as	leaders	inside	the	country	during	their	imprisonment	.
In	order	*	to	head	off	any	divisions	,	Mr.	Mandela	,	in	a	meeting	with	his	colleagues	before	they	were	released	*-1	,	instructed	them	*-2	to	report	to	the	ANC	headquarters	in	Lusaka	as	soon	as	possible	.
The	men	also	will	be	faced	*-1	with	*	bridging	the	generation	gap	between	themselves	and	the	country	's	many	militant	black	youths	,	the	so-called	young	lions	who	*T*-2	are	anxious	*	to	see	the	old	lions	in	action	.
Says	Peter	Mokaba	,	president	of	the	South	African	Youth	Congress	:	``	We	will	be	expecting	them	to	act	like	leaders	of	the	ANC	.	''
They	never	considered	themselves	to	be	anything	else	.
At	last	night	's	rally	,	they	called	on	their	followers	*	to	be	firm	,	yet	disciplined	,	in	their	opposition	to	apartheid	.
``	We	emphasize	discipline	because	we	know	that	the	government	is	very	,	very	sensitive	,	''	said	*T*-2	Andrew	Mlangeni	,	another	early	Umkhonto	leader	who	*T*-1	is	now	63	.
``	We	want	*	to	see	Nelson	Mandela	and	all	our	comrades	out	of	prison	,	and	if	we	are	n't	disciplined	*-1	we	may	not	see	them	here	with	us	.
