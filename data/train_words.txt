Rolls-Royce	Motor	Cars	Inc.	said	0	it	expects	its	U.S.	sales	to	remain	steady	at	about	1,200	cars	in	1990	.
The	luxury	auto	maker	last	year	sold	1,214	cars	in	the	U.S.
Howard	Mosher	,	president	and	chief	executive	officer	,	said	0	he	anticipates	growth	for	the	luxury	auto	maker	in	Britain	and	Europe	,	and	in	Far	Eastern	markets	.
BELL	INDUSTRIES	Inc.	increased	its	quarterly	to	10	cents	from	seven	cents	a	share	.

Investors	are	appealing	to	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	*-1	not	to	limit	their	access	to	information	about	stock	purchases	and	sales	by	corporate	insiders	.
A	SEC	proposal	*	to	ease	reporting	requirements	for	some	company	executives	would	undermine	the	usefulness	of	information	on	insider	trades	as	a	stock-picking	tool	,	individual	investors	and	professional	money	managers	contend	0	*T*-1	.
They	make	the	argument	in	letters	to	the	agency	about	rule	changes	proposed	*	this	past	summer	that	,	among	other	things	,	*T*-1	would	exempt	many	middle-management	executives	from	*-2	reporting	trades	in	their	own	companies	'	shares	.
The	proposed	changes	also	would	allow	executives	to	report	exercises	of	options	later	and	less	often	.
Many	of	the	letters	maintain	that	investor	confidence	has	been	so	shaken	by	the	1987	stock	market	crash	*RNR*-1	--	and	the	markets	already	so	stacked	*-3	against	the	little	guy	*RNR*-1	--	that	any	decrease	in	information	on	insider-trading	patterns	might	prompt	individuals	to	get	out	of	stocks	altogether	.
``	The	SEC	has	historically	paid	obeisance	to	the	ideal	of	a	level	playing	field	,	''	wrote	*T*-1	Clyde	S.	McGregor	of	Winnetka	,	Ill.	,	in	one	of	the	92	letters	0	the	agency	has	received	*T*-3	since	the	changes	were	proposed	*-2	Aug.	17	.
``	Apparently	the	commission	did	not	really	believe	in	this	ideal	.	''
Currently	,	the	rules	force	executives	,	directors	and	other	corporate	insiders	to	report	purchases	and	sales	of	their	companies	'	shares	within	about	a	month	after	the	transaction	.
But	about	25	%	of	the	insiders	,	according	to	SEC	figures	,	file	their	reports	late	.
The	changes	were	proposed	*-3	in	an	effort	*	to	streamline	federal	bureaucracy	and	boost	compliance	by	the	executives	``	who	*T*-1	are	really	calling	the	shots	,	''	said	0	*T*-4	Brian	Lane	,	special	counsel	at	the	SEC	's	office	of	disclosure	policy	,	which	*T*-2	proposed	the	changes	.
Investors	,	money	managers	and	corporate	officials	had	until	today	*-2	to	comment	on	the	proposals	,	and	the	issue	has	produced	more	mail	than	almost	any	other	issue	in	memory	,	Mr.	Lane	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	SEC	will	probably	vote	on	the	proposal	early	next	year	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
Not	all	those	who	*T*-3	wrote	oppose	the	changes	.
The	Committee	on	Federal	Regulation	of	Securities	for	the	American	Bar	Association	argues	,	for	example	,	in	its	lengthy	letter	to	the	SEC	,	that	the	proposed	changes	``	would	substantially	improve	the	-LCB-	law	-RCB-	by	*-1	conforming	it	more	closely	to	contemporary	business	realities	.	''
What	the	investors	who	*T*-4	oppose	the	proposed	changes	object	to	*T*-1	most	is	the	effect	0	they	say	0	the	proposal	would	have	*T*-2	on	their	ability	*	to	spot	telltale	``	clusters	''	of	trading	activity	--	buying	or	selling	by	more	than	one	officer	or	director	within	a	short	period	of	time	.
According	to	some	estimates	,	the	rule	changes	would	cut	insider	filings	by	more	than	a	third	.
The	SEC	's	Mr.	Lane	vehemently	disputed	those	estimates	.
The	rules	will	eliminate	filings	policy-making	divisions	,	such	as	sales	,	marketing	,	finance	and	research	and	development	,	Mr.	Lane	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	proposed	rules	also	would	be	tougher	on	the	insiders	still	required	*	to	file	reports	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
Companies	would	be	compelled	*-1	to	publish	in	annual	proxy	statements	the	names	of	insiders	who	*T*-5	fail	*-3	to	file	reports	on	time	.
*-1	Considered	as	a	whole	,	Mr.	Lane	said	,	the	filings	required	*	under	the	proposed	rules	``	will	be	at	least	as	effective	,	if	not	more	so	,	for	investors	following	transactions	.	''
But	Robert	Gabele	,	president	of	Invest\/Net	,	a	North	Miami	,	Fla.	,	company	that	*T*-6	packages	and	sells	the	insider-trading	data	,	said	0	the	proposal	is	worded	*-4	so	vaguely	that	key	officials	may	fail	*-1	to	file	the	reports	.
Many	investors	wrote	*-2	asking	the	SEC	*-3	to	require	insiders	to	report	their	purchases	and	sales	immediately	,	not	a	month	later	.
But	Mr.	Lane	said	that	while	the	SEC	regulates	who	*T*-7	files	,	the	law	tells	them	when	*	to	do	so	*T*-1	.
Investors	who	*T*-8	want	*-1	to	change	the	required	timing	should	write	their	representatives	in	Congress	,	he	added	0	*T*-2	.
The	SEC	would	likely	be	amenable	to	legislation	that	*T*-9	required	insiders	to	file	transactions	on	a	more	timely	basis	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	nation	's	largest	pension	fund	,	which	*T*-10	oversees	$	80	billion	*U*	for	college	employees	,	plans	*-1	to	offer	two	new	investment	options	to	its	1.2	million	participants	.
The	Teachers	Insurance	and	Annuity	Association-College	Retirement	Equities	Fund	said	0	it	will	introduce	a	stock	and	bond	fund	that	*T*-11	will	invest	in	``	socially	responsible	''	companies	,	and	a	bond	fund	.
Both	funds	are	expected	*-1	to	begin	operation	around	March	1	,	subject	to	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	approval	.
For	its	employees	to	sign	up	for	the	options	,	a	college	also	must	approve	the	plan	.
Some	4,300	institutions	are	part	of	the	pension	fund	.
The	new	options	carry	out	part	of	an	agreement	that	the	pension	fund	,	*-1	under	pressure	*	to	relax	its	strict	participation	rules	and	to	provide	more	investment	options	,	reached	*T*-12	with	the	SEC	in	December	.
The	new	``	social	choice	''	fund	will	shun	securities	of	companies	linked	*-1	to	South	Africa	,	nuclear	power	and	in	some	cases	,	Northern	Ireland	.
Also	excluded	*-1	will	be	*T*-2	investments	in	companies	with	``	significant	''	business	stemming	from	weapons	manufacture	,	alcoholic	beverages	or	tobacco	.
Sixty	percent	of	the	fund	will	be	invested	*-5	in	stocks	,	with	the	rest	going	into	bonds	or	short-term	investments	.
The	bond	fund	will	invest	in	high-grade	or	medium-grade	bonds	,	mortgages	or	asset-backed	securities	,	including	as	much	as	15	%	in	foreign	securities	.
The	fund	also	might	buy	and	sell	futures	and	options	contracts	,	subject	to	approval	by	the	New	York	State	Insurance	Department	.
Under	two	new	features	,	participants	will	be	able	*-1	to	transfer	money	from	the	new	funds	to	other	investment	funds	or	,	if	their	jobs	are	terminated	*-6	,	receive	cash	from	the	funds	.
The	investment	choices	offered	*	by	the	pension	fund	currently	are	limited	*-7	to	a	stock	fund	,	an	annuity	and	a	money-market	fund	.
New	Brunswick	Scientific	Co.	,	a	maker	of	biotechnology	instrumentation	and	equipment	,	said	0	it	adopted	an	anti-takeover	plan	giving	shareholders	the	right	*	to	purchase	shares	at	half	price	under	certain	conditions	.
The	company	said	0	the	plan	,	*-1	under	review	for	some	time	,	will	protect	shareholders	against	``	abusive	takeover	tactics	.
W.	Ed	Tyler	,	37	years	old	,	a	senior	vice	president	at	this	printing	concern	,	was	elected	*-8	president	of	its	technology	group	,	a	new	position	.
Solo	woodwind	players	have	*-1	to	be	creative	if	they	want	*-2	to	work	a	lot	,	because	their	repertoire	and	audience	appeal	are	limited	.
The	oboist	Heinz	Holliger	has	taken	a	hard	line	about	the	problem	:	He	commissions	*RNR*-2	and	splendidly	interprets	*RNR*-2	fearsome	contemporary	scores	and	does	some	conducting	,	so	he	does	n't	have	*-1	to	play	the	same	Mozart	and	Strauss	concertos	over	and	over	again	.
Richard	Stoltzman	has	taken	a	gentler	,	more	audience-friendly	approach	.
Years	ago	,	he	collaborated	with	the	new	music	gurus	Peter	Serkin	and	Fred	Sherry	in	the	very	countercultural	chamber	group	Tashi	,	which	*T*-13	won	audiences	over	to	dreaded	contemporary	scores	like	Messiaen	's	``	Quartet	for	the	End	of	Time	.	''
Today	,	the	pixie-like	clarinetist	has	mostly	dropped	the	missionary	work	-LRB-	though	a	touch	of	the	old	Tashi	still	survives	-RRB-	and	now	goes	on	the	road	with	piano	,	bass	,	a	slide	show	,	and	a	repertoire	that	*T*-14	ranges	from	light	classical	to	light	jazz	to	light	pop	,	with	a	few	notable	exceptions	.
Just	the	thing	for	the	Vivaldi-at-brunch	set	,	the	yuppie	audience	that	*T*-15	has	embraced	New	Age	as	its	very	own	easy	listening	.
But	you	ca	n't	dismiss	Mr.	Stoltzman	's	music	or	his	motives	as	merely	commercial	and	lightweight	.
He	believes	in	what	he	plays	*T*-16	,	and	he	plays	superbly	.
His	recent	appearance	at	the	Metropolitan	Museum	,	dubbed	*	``	A	Musical	Odyssey	,	''	was	a	case	in	point	.
It	felt	more	like	a	party	,	or	a	highly	polished	jam	session	with	a	few	friends	,	than	a	classical	concert	.
*-1	Clad	in	his	trademark	black	velvet	suit	,	the	soft-spoken	clarinetist	announced	that	his	new	album	,	``	Inner	Voices	,	''	had	just	been	released	*-9	,	that	his	family	was	in	the	front	row	,	and	that	it	was	his	mother	's	birthday	,	so	he	was	going	*-2	to	play	her	favorite	tune	from	the	record	.
He	launched	into	Saint-Saens	's	``	The	Swan	''	from	``	Carnival	of	the	Animals	,	''	a	favorite	encore	piece	for	cellists	,	with	lovely	,	glossy	tone	and	no	bite	.
Then	,	as	if	*-1	to	show	that	he	could	play	fast	as	well	,	he	offered	the	second	movement	from	Saint-Saens	's	Sonata	for	Clarinet	,	a	whimsical	,	puckish	tidbit	that	*T*-17	reflected	the	flip	side	of	the	Stoltzman	personality	.
And	so	it	went	*T*-1	through	the	first	half	:	an	ingeniously	chosen	potpourri	of	pieces	,	none	longer	than	five	minutes	,	none	that	*T*-18	would	disturb	or	challenge	a	listener	.
Mr.	Stoltzman	introduced	his	colleagues	:	Bill	Douglas	,	pianist\/bassoonist\/composer	and	an	old	buddy	from	Yale	,	and	jazz	bassist	Eddie	Gomez	.
An	improvisational	section	was	built	*-10	around	pieces	by	Mr.	Douglas	,	beginning	with	``	Golden	Rain	,	''	a	lilting	,	laid-back	lead	in	to	the	uptempo	``	Sky	,	''	which	*T*-19	gave	Mr.	Stoltzman	the	opportunity	*	to	wail	in	a	high	register	and	show	off	his	fleet	fingers	.
Bach	's	``	Air	''	followed	.
Mr.	Stoltzman	tied	the	composer	in	by	*-4	proclaiming	him	``	the	great	improviser	of	the	18th	century	,	''	and	then	built	on	the	image	by	*-4	joining	with	Mr.	Douglas	in	some	Bach	two-part	inventions	,	cleverly	arranged	*	for	clarinet	and	bassoon	by	Mr.	Douglas	.
*-1	Keeping	the	mood	light	,	the	two	then	chanted	and	chortled	their	way	through	some	murderous	polyrhythms	,	devised	*	by	Mr.	Douglas	as	an	alternative	to	Hindemith	's	dry	theory-teaching	techniques	,	and	then	,	with	Mr.	Gomez	,	soared	and	improvised	on	the	composer	's	tight	``	Bebop	Etudes	.	''
The	end	of	the	first	half	,	however	,	brought	what	the	standing-room-only	crowd	seemed	*-2	to	be	waiting	for	*T*-1	:	the	pop	singer	Judy	Collins	,	who	*T*-20	appears	on	``	Inner	Voices	.	''
*-2	Glamorous	and	pure-voiced	as	ever	,	Ms.	Collins	sang	Joni	Mitchell	's	``	For	Free	''	--	about	an	encounter	with	a	street-corner	clarinetist	,	to	which	Mr.	Stoltzman	contributed	a	clarinet	obligatto	*T*-1	--	and	Mr.	Douglas	's	lush	setting	of	a	Gaelic	blessing	,	``	Deep	Peace	.	''
``	Deep	Peace	''	also	featured	a	slide	show	of	lovely	but	predictable	images	of	clouds	,	beaches	,	deserts	,	sunsets	,	etc	.
It	was	all	too	mellow	0	*T*-2	to	be	believed	*-11	,	but	they	probably	would	have	gotten	away	with	it	,	had	they	not	felt	compelled	*-1	to	add	Ms.	Collins	's	signature	tune	,	``	Amazing	Grace	,	''	and	ask	for	audience	participation	.
That	went	over	the	permissible	line	for	warm	and	fuzzy	feelings	.
Was	this	why	some	of	the	audience	departed	*T*-1	before	or	during	the	second	half	?
Or	was	it	because	Ms.	Collins	had	gone	?
Either	way	it	was	a	pity	,	because	Mr.	Stolzman	offered	the	most	substantial	music	of	the	evening	*ICH*-1	just	after	intermission	:	Steve	Reich	's	``	New	York	Counterpoint	,	''	one	of	a	series	of	Reich	works	that	*T*-21	juxtapose	a	live	performer	with	recorded	tracks	of	his	or	her	own	playing	.
-LRB-	Mr.	Reich	's	new	``	Different	Trains	''	for	string	quartet	uses	the	technique	magisterially	.	-RRB-
Mr.	Stoltzman	must	have	worried	that	his	audience	might	not	be	able	*-1	to	take	it	:	He	warned	us	in	advance	that	``	New	York	Counterpoint	''	lasts	11	1\/2	minutes	.
He	also	unfortunately	illustrated	this	intricate	,	jazzy	tapestry	with	Mr.	Pearson	's	images	,	this	time	of	geometric	or	repeating	objects	,	in	a	kitschy	mirroring	of	the	musical	structure	that	*T*-22	was	thoroughly	distracting	from	Mr.	Reich	's	piece	and	Mr.	Stoltzman	's	elegant	execution	of	it	.
The	rest	of	the	concert	was	more	straight	jazz	and	mellow	sounds	written	*	by	Charlie	Parker	,	Ornette	Coleman	,	Bill	Douglas	and	Eddie	Gomez	,	with	pictures	for	the	Douglas	pieces	.
It	*EXP*-1	was	enjoyable	*	to	hear	accomplished	jazz	without	*-2	having	*-3	to	sit	in	a	smoke-filled	club	,	but	like	the	first	half	,	much	of	it	was	easy	0	*	to	take	*T*-4	and	ultimately	forgettable	.
Is	this	the	future	of	chamber	music	?
Managers	and	presenters	insist	that	chamber	music	concerts	are	a	hard	sell	,	but	can	audiences	really	enjoy	them	only	if	the	music	is	purged	*-1	of	threatening	elements	,	served	*-1	up	in	bite-sized	morsels	and	accompanied	*-1	by	visuals	?
What	*T*-23	's	next	?
Slides	0	*T*-1	to	illustrate	Shostakovich	quartets	?
It	was	not	an	unpleasant	evening	,	certainly	,	thanks	to	the	high	level	of	performance	,	the	compositional	talents	of	Mr.	Douglas	,	and	the	obvious	sincerity	with	which	Mr.	Stoltzman	chooses	his	selections	*T*-1	.
But	it	was	neither	deep	nor	lasting	:	light	entertainment	that	*T*-24	was	no	substitute	for	an	evening	of	Brahms	.
Ms.	Waleson	is	a	free-lance	writer	based	*	in	New	York	.
One	of	Ronald	Reagan	's	attributes	as	President	was	that	he	rarely	gave	his	blessing	to	the	claptrap	that	*T*-25	passes	for	``	consensus	''	in	various	international	institutions	.
In	fact	,	he	liberated	the	U.S.	from	one	of	the	world	's	most	corrupt	organizations	--	UNESCO	.
This	is	the	U.N.	group	that	*T*-26	managed	*-1	to	traduce	its	own	charter	of	*	promoting	education	,	science	and	culture	.
Ever	since	,	the	remaining	members	have	been	desperate	for	the	United	States	to	rejoin	this	dreadful	group	.
Now	UNESCO	apologists	are	lobbying	President	Bush	*-1	to	renege	on	President	Reagan	's	decision	*	to	depart	.
But	we	can	think	of	many	reasons	0	*	to	stay	out	*T*-1	for	the	foreseeable	future	and	well	beyond	.
The	U.S.	,	along	with	Britain	and	Singapore	,	left	the	agency	when	its	anti-Western	ideology	,	financial	corruption	and	top	leadership	got	out	of	hand	*T*-1	.
The	personal	antics	of	agency	Director	Amadou-Mahtar	M'Bow	*ICH*-5	drew	much	attention	,	such	as	when	several	of	his	top	aides	were	uncovered	*-2	as	KGB	plants	and	ejected	*-2	from	France	*T*-1	and	when	a	mysterious	office	fire	was	set	*-12	just	before	Congress	sent	accountants	0	*T*-4	to	trace	U.S.	funds	*T*-3	.
Mr.	M'Bow	was	an	extreme	case	,	but	even	his	replacement	,	the	more	personally	genial	Spanish	biochemist	Federico	Mayor	,	has	had	little	success	at	*-1	achieving	reforms	.
Several	ridiculous	projects	*ICH*-1	continue	,	including	the	``	New	International	Economic	Order	,	''	which	*T*-27	means	redistributionism	from	the	West	0	*T*-2	to	pay	for	everyone	else	's	statism	.
The	Orwellian	``	New	World	Information	Order	''	would	give	government	officials	rights	against	the	press	;	journalists	would	be	obliged	*-1	to	kowtow	to	their	government	,	which	*T*-28	would	have	licensing	and	censorship	powers	and	,	indeed	,	duties	*	to	block	printing	of	``	wrong	''	ideas	.
UNESCO	somehow	converted	the	founding	U.N.	ideals	of	individual	rights	and	liberty	into	``	peoples	'	rights	.	''
Million-dollar	conferences	*ICH*-2	were	held	*-13	0	*T*-1	to	chew	on	subjects	such	as	``	ethical	responsibilities	of	scientists	in	support	of	disarmament	''	and	``	the	impact	of	the	activities	of	transnational	corporations	.	''
The	agency	was	so	totally	subverted	*-1	from	the	high	principles	of	its	founding	that	even	the	Soviets	now	wonder	about	an	agency	that	*T*-29	seemed	so	congenial	to	them	.
Glasnost	may	be	partly	responsible	,	but	Soviet	Foreign	Minister	Eduard	Shevardnadze	last	year	admitted	,	``	The	exaggerated	ideological	approach	undermined	tolerance	intrinsic	to	UNESCO	.	''
UNESCO	is	now	holding	its	biennial	meetings	*ICH*-2	in	Paris	0	*T*-1	to	devise	its	next	projects	.
Mr.	Mayor	's	hope	that	references	to	``	press	freedom	''	would	survive	*-1	unamended	seems	doomed	to	failure	;	the	current	phrasing	is	``	*	educating	the	public	and	media	*-2	to	avoid	manipulation	.	''
He	has	n't	been	able	*-1	to	replace	the	M'Bow	cabal	.
Soviets	remain	in	charge	of	education	programs	,	a	former	head	of	an	African	military	tribunal	for	executions	is	in	charge	of	culture	,	and	a	hard-line	Polish	communist	in	exile	directs	the	human-rights	and	peace	division	.
Of	the	agency	's	2,750	staff	members	,	230	*T*-1	are	in	the	field	*-2	working	on	actual	projects	,	such	as	literacy	and	oceanographic	research	.
The	position	of	the	United	States	,	which	*T*-30	once	contributed	25	%	of	the	budget	,	is	that	nothing	has	changed	.
John	Bolton	,	the	assistant	secretary	of	state	for	international	organizations	,	told	Congress	that	the	continuing	``	statist	,	restrictive	,	nondemocratic	''	programs	make	*	rejoining	any	time	soon	``	extremely	unlikely	.	''
This	has	n't	much	bothered	the	UNESCO	delegates	,	who	*T*-31	last	week	could	n't	even	agree	*-2	to	raise	funds	by	*-3	selling	off	a	fancy	19th-century	French	chateau	0	the	agency	somehow	owns	*T*-1	.
Other	countries	,	including	West	Germany	,	may	have	a	hard	time	*	justifying	continued	membership	.
We	see	an	even	stronger	argument	against	UNESCO	than	its	unsurprising	failure	to	reform	.
This	is	that	the	Reagan	Revolution	spanning	Eastern	Europe	and	Tiananmen	Square	shows	the	power	of	ideas	unencumbered	by	international	civil	servants	or	government	functionaries	.
Free	markets	,	free	minds	and	free	elections	have	an	appeal	that	*T*-32	seems	*-1	to	get	muddled	*-3	only	when	*	delivered	*-4	through	U.N.	organizations	--	which	of	course	*T*-33	are	made	*-5	up	largely	of	governments	that	*T*-34	fear	these	principles	at	home	*T*-2	.
The	Babelists	of	the	United	Nations	are	experts	at	obfuscation	.
This	can	have	its	purposes	at	times	,	but	there	's	no	reason	0	*	to	cloud	the	importance	and	allure	of	Western	concepts	of	freedom	and	justice	*T*-1	.
We	can	see	plenty	of	reasons	0	*	to	stay	out	*T*-1	,	and	none	0	*	to	rejoin	UNESCO	*T*-2	.
Researchers	at	Plant	Genetic	Systems	N.V.	in	Belgium	said	0	they	have	developed	a	genetic	engineering	technique	for	*	creating	hybrid	plants	for	a	number	of	key	crops	.
The	researchers	said	0	they	have	isolated	a	plant	gene	that	*T*-35	prevents	the	production	of	pollen	.
The	gene	thus	can	prevent	a	plant	from	*-1	fertilizing	itself	.
Such	so-called	male-sterile	plants	can	then	be	fertilized	*-14	by	pollen	from	another	strain	of	the	plant	,	thereby	*	producing	hybrid	seed	.
The	new	generation	of	plants	will	possess	the	flourishing	,	high-production	trait	known	*	as	``	hybrid	vigor	,	''	similar	to	that	now	seen	*	in	hybrid	corn	.
``	The	development	could	have	a	dramatic	effect	on	farm	production	,	especially	cotton	,	''	said	*T*-1	Murray	Robinson	,	president	of	Delta	&	Pine	Land	Co.	,	a	Southwide	Inc.	subsidiary	that	*T*-36	is	one	of	the	largest	cotton	seed	producers	in	the	U.S.	.
On	a	commercial	scale	,	the	sterilization	of	the	pollen-producing	male	part	has	only	been	achieved	*-15	in	corn	and	sorghum	feed	grains	.
That	's	because	the	male	part	,	the	tassel	,	and	the	female	,	the	ear	,	are	some	distance	apart	on	the	corn	plant	.
In	a	labor-intensive	process	,	the	seed	companies	cut	off	the	tassels	of	each	plant	,	*-1	making	it	male	sterile	.
They	sow	a	row	of	male-fertile	plants	*ICH*-1	nearby	,	which	then	*T*-2	pollinate	the	male-sterile	plants	.
The	first	hybrid	corn	seeds	produced	*	*	using	this	mechanical	approach	were	introduced	*-16	in	the	1930s	and	they	yielded	as	much	as	20	%	more	corn	than	naturally	pollinated	plants	.
The	vast	majority	of	the	U.S.	corn	crop	now	is	grown	*-17	from	hybrid	seeds	produced	*	by	seed	companies	.
A	similar	technique	is	almost	impossible	0	*	to	apply	*T*-1	to	other	crops	,	such	as	cotton	,	soybeans	and	rice	.
The	male	part	*RNR*-2	,	the	anthers	of	the	plant	,	and	the	female	*RNR*-2	,	the	pistils	,	of	the	same	plant	are	within	a	fraction	of	an	inch	or	even	attached	*-1	to	each	other	.
The	anthers	in	these	plants	are	difficult	0	*	to	clip	*T*-1	off	.
In	China	,	a	great	number	of	workers	are	engaged	*-18	in	*-2	pulling	out	the	male	organs	of	rice	plants	*-3	using	tweezers	,	and	one-third	of	rice	produced	*	in	that	country	is	grown	*-19	from	hybrid	seeds	.
At	Plant	Genetic	Systems	,	researchers	have	isolated	a	pollen-inhibiting	gene	that	*T*-1	can	be	inserted	*-20	in	a	plant	*	to	confer	male	sterility	.
Jan	Leemans	,	research	director	,	said	0	this	gene	was	successfully	introduced	in	oil-producing	rapeseed	plants	,	a	major	crop	in	Europe	and	Canada	,	*	using	as	a	carrier	a	``	promoter	gene	''	developed	*	by	Robert	Goldberg	at	the	University	of	California	in	Los	Angeles	.
The	sterilizing	gene	is	expressed	*-21	just	before	the	pollen	is	about	*-1	to	develop	and	it	deactivates	the	anthers	of	every	flower	in	the	plant	.
Mr.	Leemans	said	0	this	genetic	manipulation	does	n't	hurt	the	growth	of	that	plant	.
The	researchers	also	pulled	off	a	second	genetic	engineering	trick	in	order	*-1	to	get	male-sterile	plants	in	large	enough	numbers	*	to	produce	a	commercial	hybrid	seed	crop	.
They	attached	a	second	gene	,	for	herbicide	resistance	,	to	the	pollen-inhibiting	gene	.
Both	genes	are	then	inserted	*-2	into	a	few	greenhouse	plants	,	which	*T*-37	are	then	pollinated	*-1	and	allowed	*-1	to	mature	and	produce	seed	.
The	laws	of	heredity	dictate	that	half	of	the	plants	springing	from	these	greenhouse-produced	seeds	will	be	male	sterile	and	herbicide	resistant	and	half	will	be	male	fertile	and	herbicide	susceptible	.
The	application	of	herbicide	would	kill	off	the	male-fertile	plants	,	*-1	leaving	a	large	field	of	male-sterile	plants	that	*T*-2	can	be	cross-pollinated	*-22	*	to	produce	hybrid	seed	.
Mr.	Leemans	said	0	the	hybrid	rapeseeds	created	*	with	this	genetic	engineering	yield	15	%	to	30	%	*U*	more	output	than	the	commercial	strains	used	*	currently	.
``	This	technique	is	applicable	to	a	wide	variety	of	crops	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	,	and	added	that	some	modifications	may	be	necessary	*	to	accommodate	the	peculiarities	of	each	type	of	crop	.
He	said	0	the	company	is	experimenting	with	the	technique	on	alfalfa	,	and	plans	*-2	to	include	cotton	and	corn	,	among	other	crops	.
He	said	that	even	though	virtually	all	corn	seeds	currently	planted	*	are	hybrids	,	the	genetic	approach	will	obviate	the	need	for	mechanical	emasculation	of	anthers	,	which	*T*-38	costs	U.S.	seed	producers	about	$	70	million	*U*	annually	.
In	recent	years	,	demand	for	hybrid	seeds	has	spurred	research	at	a	number	of	chemical	and	biotechnology	companies	,	including	Monsanto	Co.	,	Shell	Oil	Co.	and	Eli	Lilly	&	Co	.
One	technique	developed	*	by	some	of	these	companies	involves	a	chemical	spray	supposed	*	to	kill	only	a	plant	's	pollen	.
But	there	have	been	problems	with	chemical	sprays	damaging	plants	'	female	reproductive	organs	and	concern	for	the	toxicity	of	such	chemical	sprays	to	humans	,	animals	and	beneficial	insects	.
However	,	Paul	Johanson	,	Monsanto	's	director	of	plant	sciences	,	said	0	the	company	's	chemical	spray	overcomes	these	problems	and	is	``	gentle	on	the	female	organ	.	''
Biosource	Genetics	Corp.	,	Vacaville	,	Calif.	,	is	developing	a	spray	containing	a	gene	that	*T*-39	spreads	from	cell	to	cell	and	interferes	with	the	genes	that	*T*-40	are	responsible	for	*	producing	pollen	.
This	gene	,	called	*	``	gametocide	,	''	is	carried	*-23	into	the	plant	by	a	virus	that	*T*-41	remains	active	for	a	few	days	.
Robert	Erwin	,	president	of	Biosource	,	called	Plant	Genetic	's	approach	``	interesting	''	and	``	novel	,	''	and	``	complementary	rather	than	competitive	.	''
``	There	is	a	large	market	out	there	hungry	for	hybrid	seeds	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Robinson	of	Delta	&	Pine	,	the	seed	producer	in	Scott	,	Miss.	,	said	0	Plant	Genetic	's	success	in	*	creating	genetically	engineered	male	steriles	does	n't	automatically	mean	0	it	*EXP*-1	would	be	simple	*	to	create	hybrids	in	all	crops	.
That	's	because	pollination	,	while	*	easy	in	corn	because	the	carrier	is	wind	,	is	more	complex	and	involves	insects	as	carriers	in	crops	such	as	cotton	.
``	It	*EXP*-2	's	one	thing	*	to	say	0	you	can	sterilize	,	and	another	*	to	then	successfully	pollinate	the	plant	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
Nevertheless	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	,	he	is	negotiating	with	Plant	Genetic	*-2	to	acquire	the	technology	0	*T*-3	to	try	*-4	breeding	hybrid	cotton	.
A	bitter	conflict	with	global	implications	has	erupted	between	Nomura	Securities	Co.	and	Industrial	Bank	of	Japan	,	two	of	the	world	's	most	powerful	financial	companies	.
The	clash	is	a	sign	of	a	new	toughness	and	divisiveness	in	Japan	's	once-cozy	financial	circles	.
Not	only	are	Japan	's	financial	institutions	putting	their	enormous	clout	to	work	;	increasingly	they	're	squaring	off	against	one	another	in	unprecedented	public	fashion	.
Already	,	the	consequences	are	being	felt	*-24	by	other	players	in	the	financial	markets	--	even	governments	.
What	*T*-42	triggered	the	latest	clash	was	a	skirmish	over	the	timing	of	a	New	Zealand	government	bond	issue	.
Nomura	was	attempting	*-1	to	organize	the	50	billion-yen	-LRB-	$	352	million	*U*	-RRB-	borrowing	in	Japan	at	a	time	when	many	Japanese	banks	,	led	*	by	Industrial	Bank	of	Japan	,	were	pressuring	the	Wellington	government	to	help	them	recover	loans	made	*	to	a	defunct	investment	bank	that	*T*-3	had	been	owned	*-25	by	New	Zealand	's	civil-service	pension	fund	*T*-2	.
*-1	Unwilling	*-2	to	put	up	new	money	for	New	Zealand	until	those	debts	are	repaid	*-26	,	most	banks	refused	*-1	even	to	play	administrative	roles	in	the	new	financing	,	*-1	forcing	an	embarrassed	Nomura	to	postpone	it	this	week	.
The	dispute	shows	clearly	the	global	power	of	Japan	's	financial	titans	.
Aside	from	Nomura	's	injured	pride	,	the	biggest	victim	so	far	has	been	the	New	Zealand	government	.
*-1	Barred	*-3	by	its	budget	law	from	*-4	making	any	new	domestic	bond	issues	,	Wellington	's	Debt	Management	Office	had	been	casting	abroad	*-1	to	raise	the	3	billion	New	Zealand	dollars	-LRB-	US$	1.76	billion	*U*	-RRB-	to	NZ$	4	billion	*U*	0	it	needs	*-5	to	come	up	with	*T*-2	by	the	end	of	its	fiscal	year	next	June	30	.
With	Japan	's	cash-flush	banks	aligned	*-1	against	it	,	though	,	*	raising	money	may	be	difficult	.
Not	only	can	they	block	Wellington	from	*-2	raising	money	in	Japan	,	bankers	here	say	0	*T*-1	,	but	as	the	largest	underwriters	in	the	Eurobond	market	,	they	might	be	able	*-3	to	scuttle	borrowings	there	,	too	.
New	Zealand	's	finance	minister	,	David	Caygill	,	lashed	out	at	such	suggestions	.
He	told	reporters	in	Wellington	Tuesday	that	the	government	had	n't	guaranteed	the	loans	to	DFC	New	Zealand	Ltd.	,	an	investment	bank	80%-owned	by	the	National	Provident	Fund	,	and	would	n't	bail	it	out	.
``	It	may	very	well	be	what	the	Japanese	banks	want	*T*-43	,	''	he	told	Radio	New	Zealand	*T*-1	.
``	I	think	0	it	would	be	irresponsible	and	I	am	not	about	*-1	to	be	blackmailed	*-27	by	Japanese	banks	or	any	other	international	interests	.	''
No	less	significant	than	the	Japanese	banks	'	attempt	*	to	cut	off	funds	*-2	to	pressure	a	foreign	government	are	*T*-1	the	implications	of	a	confrontation	between	Japan	securities	and	banking	industries	.
Anxiety	is	rising	over	recent	government	proposals	*	to	eventually	lower	the	strict	barriers	that	*T*-44	now	separate	--	and	protect	--	the	two	industries	from	each	other	.
Both	sides	are	jealously	guarding	their	turf	,	and	relations	have	been	at	a	flashpoint	for	months	.
The	banks	badly	want	*-1	to	break	into	all	aspects	of	the	securities	business	.
Meanwhile	,	the	securities	companies	--	most	of	them	smaller	than	the	banks	--	are	seeking	access	only	to	limited	kinds	of	banking	that	*T*-45	would	n't	open	them	to	the	full	brunt	of	competition	from	the	banks	.
Nomura	,	the	world	's	biggest	securities	company	largely	by	virtue	of	its	protected	home	field	,	and	Industrial	Bank	of	Japan	,	Japan	's	most	innovative	and	aggressive	bank	in	capital	markets	abroad	,	captain	the	opposing	sides	.
And	their	suspicions	of	each	other	run	deep	.
In	the	past	year	,	both	have	tried	*-1	to	stretch	the	limits	of	their	businesses	.
Nomura	started	a	credit-card	venture	*ICH*-2	with	American	Express	Co.	that	*T*-1	allowed	cardholders	to	use	their	Nomura	securities	accounts	like	a	bank	account	,	*-3	attracting	the	wrath	of	banks	.
And	Industrial	Bank	of	Japan	started	up	a	London	securities	subsidiary	that	*T*-46	sells	Japanese	stocks	to	non-Japanese	institutions	overseas	,	a	move	that	*T*-47	stirred	the	anger	of	the	stock	brokerage	firms	.
The	New	Zealand	bond	issue	simply	has	brought	the	two	institutions	face-to-face	.
ITEL	CORP.	reported	third-quarter	earnings	,	which	*T*-48	were	mistakenly	shown	in	the	Quarterly	Earnings	Surprises	table	in	yesterday	's	edition	*-2	to	be	lower	than	the	average	of	analysts	'	estimates	.
On	a	pretax	basis	,	Itel	's	third-quarter	earnings	of	30	cents	a	share	were	actually	7.14	%	higher	than	the	average	of	estimates	.
Raymond	E.	Ross	,	53	years	old	,	formerly	group	vice	president	,	U.S.	plastics	machinery	,	at	this	machine	tool	,	plastics	machinery	and	robots	concern	,	was	named	*-1	senior	vice	president	,	industrial	systems	,	*-2	succeeding	David	A.	Entrekin	,	who	*T*-49	resigned	Monday	.
John	A.	Conlon	Jr.	,	45	,	was	named	*-29	a	managing	director	at	this	investment-banking	company	.
He	will	be	in	charge	of	research	,	equity	sales	and	trading	,	and	the	syndicate	operation	of	Rothschild	.
Mr.	Conlon	was	executive	vice	president	and	director	of	the	equity	division	of	the	international	division	of	Nikko	Securities	Co	.
As	Yogi	Berra	might	say	,	it	's	deja	vu	all	over	again	.
*-2	Crouched	*-3	at	shortstop	,	Bert	Campaneris	,	once	Oakland	's	master	thief	,	effortlessly	scoops	up	a	groundball	and	flips	it	to	second	.
In	the	outfield	,	Paul	Blair	,	the	Orioles	'	eight-time	Gold	Glove	winner	,	elegantly	shags	a	fly	.
On	the	mound	,	former	Red	Sox	great	Luis	Tiant	,	the	wily	master	of	1,001	moves	,	throws	an	off-speed	strike	.
``	Babies	,	kiddies	,	''	growls	*T*-1	their	manager	--	a	fellow	named	*-2	Earl	Weaver	,	who	,	in	a	different	time	,	*T*-3	handled	four	World	Series	teams	and	now	*T*-3	handles	the	Gold	Coast	Suns	.
``	Old-time	kiddies	,	''	he	says	*-2	.
Perhaps	.
But	for	the	next	few	months	,	these	boys	of	summers	long	past	are	going	*-1	to	be	reveling	in	an	Indian	summer	of	the	soul	.
Now	that	the	baseball	season	is	officially	over	,	you	see	0	*T*-1	,	it	's	time	0	for	a	new	season	to	begin	*T*-2	.
Today	is	the	debut	of	the	Senior	Professional	Baseball	Association	,	a	new	eight-team	pro	sports	circuit	,	modeled	*	after	the	highly	successful	senior	tennis	and	golf	tours	and	complete	with	good	salaries	,	a	cable	television	contract	and	even	expansion	plans	.
One	hundred	and	ninety	two	former	greats	,	near	greats	,	hardly	knowns	and	unknowns	begin	a	72-game	,	three-month	season	in	spring-training	stadiums	up	and	down	Florida	.
For	everyone	involved	*	,	it	's	one	more	swig	of	that	elixir	of	youth	,	baseball	.
``	Someone	always	makes	you	quit	,	''	says	*T*-1	legendary	St.	Louis	Cardinals	centerfielder	Curt	Flood	,	the	league	's	commissioner	.
``	You	feel	0	you	want	one	more	--	one	more	at-bat	,	one	more	hit	,	one	more	game	.	''
Until	the	baby-faced	heroes	of	today	reclaim	these	ballparks	for	spring	training	,	there	is	one	more	.
And	not	just	for	the	players	.
It	's	one	more	for	the	baseball-loving	lawyers	,	accountants	and	real	estate	developers	who	*T*-50	ponied	up	about	$	1	million	*U*	each	for	the	chance	*-1	to	be	an	owner	,	to	step	into	the	shoes	of	a	Gene	Autry	or	have	a	beer	with	Rollie	Fingers	.
``	Nothing	can	be	better	than	this	,	''	says	*T*-1	Don	Sider	,	owner	of	the	West	Palm	Beach	Tropics	.
Early	in	the	morning	Mr.	Sider	,	an	estate	lawyer	,	pores	over	last	wills	and	testaments	.
Midmorning	,	he	dons	an	orange-and-blue	uniform	and	,	for	fun	,	may	field	a	bunt	from	Dave	Kingman	.
It	's	one	more	,	too	,	for	the	fans	who	*T*-51	dream	of	a	season	that	*T*-52	never	ends	.
``	I	feel	like	a	little	kid	,	''	says	*T*-1	a	gleeful	Alex	de	Castro	,	a	car	salesman	,	who	*T*-53	has	stopped	by	a	workout	of	the	Suns	*-3	to	slip	six	Campaneris	cards	*ICH*-2	to	the	Great	Man	Himself	0	*T*-4	to	be	autographed	*-30	.
The	league	's	promoters	hope	0	retirees	and	tourists	will	join	die-hard	fans	like	Mr.	de	Castro	and	pack	the	stands	*-1	to	see	the	seniors	.
The	league	is	the	brainchild	of	Colorado	real	estate	developer	James	Morley	--	once	a	minor-leaguer	himself	--	who	*T*-54	says	0	he	had	the	idea	last	January	while	*-1	lying	on	a	beach	in	Australia	.
When	he	sent	letters	offering	1,250	retired	major	leaguers	the	chance	of	another	season	*T*-1	,	730	responded	.
Eventually	,	about	250	made	the	trip	to	Florida	*-1	to	compete	for	the	available	slots	.
-LRB-	Players	have	*-1	to	be	35	or	older	,	except	for	catchers	,	who	*T*-55	are	eligible	at	32	because	life	behind	the	plate	is	so	rough	.	-RRB-
For	some	players	,	the	lure	is	money	--	up	to	$	15,000	*U*	a	month	.
Others	,	just	released	*	from	the	majors	,	hope	0	the	senior	league	will	be	their	bridge	back	into	the	big-time	.
But	as	they	hurl	fireballs	that	*T*-2	smolder	rather	than	burn	,	and	relive	old	duels	in	the	sun	,	it	*EXP*-1	's	clear	that	most	are	there	*-3	to	make	their	fans	cheer	again	or	recapture	the	camaraderie	of	seasons	past	or	prove	to	themselves	and	their	colleagues	that	they	still	have	it	--	or	something	close	to	it	.
``	My	fastball	is	good	.
Real	good	,	''	says	39-year-old	Pete	Broberg	,	*-1	working	in	the	midday	heat	of	the	Tropics	camp	.
Mr.	Broberg	,	who	*T*-56	started	with	the	now-defunct	Washington	Senators	,	says	that	when	he	left	baseball	in	1978	*T*-1	,	he	``	never	looked	back	.	''
For	a	long	time	,	he	ignored	baseball	*ICH*-1	altogether	,	even	the	sports	pages	.
Now	Mr.	Broberg	,	a	lawyer	,	claims	0	he	'd	play	for	free	.
``	You	ca	n't	give	it	up	that	easily	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	I	tried	.	''
The	nagging	memory	of	one	afternoon	fourteen	years	ago	drove	Jim	Gideon	,	a	lean	36-year-old	righthander	to	take	a	four-month	leave	from	*	selling	insurance	in	Texas	*-1	to	try	out	for	Mr.	Weaver	's	team	.
``	It	does	n't	replace	*	pitching	in	the	majors	,	but	it	proves	to	me	that	I	would	have	been	able	*-2	to	play	if	I	'd	stayed	healthy	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
Back	in	1975	,	late	in	the	season	,	a	then-21	Mr.	Gideon	made	his	only	major	league	appearance	,	five	and	two-thirds	innings	for	the	Texas	Rangers	against	the	Chicago	White	Sox	.
He	gave	up	seven	hits	,	walked	five	and	did	n't	get	a	decision	.
Arm	troubles	forced	him	back	to	the	minors	the	next	year	.
``	There	's	a	satisfaction	in	*	going	against	the	rules	,	''	offers	*T*-1	Will	McEnaney	,	once	a	stopper	with	Cincinnati	's	Big	Red	Machine	.
He	means	the	rule	that	a	player	ca	n't	cut	it	after	a	certain	age	.
These	days	he	hustles	to	house-painting	jobs	in	his	Chevy	pickup	before	and	after	*-1	training	with	the	Tropics	.
While	*-1	sipping	a	beer	after	practice	,	he	vividly	recounts	*-1	getting	the	Red	Sox	's	Carl	Yastrzemski	to	pop	out	*-2	to	end	the	1975	World	Series	,	and	repeating	the	feat	against	the	Yankees	'	Roy	White	in	1976	.
Some	of	the	game	's	reigning	philosophers	dislike	the	idea	of	middle-aged	men	attempting	a	young	man	's	sport	.
``	I	personally	do	n't	enjoy	*-1	seeing	players	who	I	remember	*T*-57	vividly	from	their	playing	days	running	about	and	being	gallant	about	their	deficiencies	,	''	says	*T*-2	Roger	Angell	,	New	Yorker	magazine	's	resident	baseball	sage	.
``	I	feel	0	people	should	be	allowed	*-1	to	remember	players	as	they	were	.	''
Worse	,	says	*ICH*-2	baseball	author	Lawrence	Ritter	,	``	Someone	will	get	a	heart	attack	and	that	will	be	the	end	of	the	whole	story	.	''
But	the	ballplayers	disagree	.
Most	are	trim	.
Some	have	been	training	for	months	;	others	only	recently	left	active	status	.
-LRB-	No	one	has	worked	out	the	players	'	average	age	,	but	most	appear	*-1	to	be	in	their	late	30s	.	-RRB-
And	there	's	pride	.
``	I	'm	not	going	*-1	to	look	stupid	,	''	vows	*T*-2	former	Pittsburgh	Pirate	second	baseman	Rennie	Stennett	,	sweat	dotting	his	brow	as	he	prepares	for	some	practice	swings	.
``	It	's	going	*-2	to	be	a	tough	league	,	''	promises	*T*-1	the	47-year-old	Mr.	Campaneris	.
``	There	will	be	a	lot	of	malice	.	''
Men	who	*T*-58	have	played	hard	all	their	lives	are	n't	about	*-2	to	change	their	habits	,	he	says	*T*-1	.
Nonetheless	,	one	ca	n't	help	*-1	wonder	whether	the	game	will	be	just	a	little	bit	slower	.
At	the	weatherbeaten	Pompano	Beach	municipal	stadium	,	Mr.	Blair	,	the	45-year-old	former	Oriole	,	knows	0	his	power	is	n't	what	it	used	*-2	to	be	*T*-1	.
So	he	adjusts	.

In	a	surprise	move	,	the	British	government	cleared	the	way	for	a	bidding	war	for	Jaguar	PLC	by	*-1	agreeing	*-2	to	remove	an	obstacle	to	a	takeover	of	the	auto	maker	.
Trade	and	Industry	Secretary	Nicholas	Ridley	told	the	House	of	Commons	yesterday	that	he	will	relinquish	the	government	's	so-called	golden	share	in	the	company	as	long	as	Jaguar	shareholders	agree	.
The	golden	share	restricts	any	individual	holding	to	15	%	and	expires	at	the	end	of	1990	.
It	*EXP*-3	was	in	Jaguar	's	best	interests	``	for	the	company	's	future	to	be	assured	and	the	present	climate	of	uncertainty	resolved	as	quickly	as	possible	,	''	Mr.	Ridley	said	0	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Ridley	's	decision	fires	the	starting	pistol	for	perhaps	a	costly	contest	between	the	world	's	auto	giants	for	Britain	's	leading	luxury-car	maker	.
Both	General	Motors	Corp.	and	Ford	Motor	Co.	have	been	trying	*-1	to	amass	15	%	stakes	in	Jaguar	.
Ford	,	which	*T*-64	already	has	an	unwelcome	13.2	%	holding	,	is	prepared	*-1	to	bid	for	the	entire	company	and	had	lobbied	the	government	to	lift	the	takeover	restrictions	early	.
GM	has	been	negotiating	a	friendly	transaction	with	Jaguar	that	*T*-65	likely	would	involve	joint	ventures	and	an	eventual	stake	of	just	under	30	%	.
But	the	government	's	action	,	which	*T*-66	caught	Jaguar	management	*-2	flat-footed	,	may	scuttle	the	GM	minority	deal	by	*-3	forcing	it	to	fight	for	all	of	Jaguar	.
``	I	ca	n't	believe	0	they	-LRB-	GM	-RRB-	will	let	Ford	have	a	free	run	,	''	said	*T*-1	Stephen	Reitman	,	a	European	auto	industry	analyst	at	UBS-Phillips	&	Drew	.
``	I	am	sure	0	they	will	be	going	for	a	full	bid	.	''
Many	investors	certainly	believe	0	a	bidding	war	is	imminent	.
Jaguar	shares	skyrocketed	yesterday	after	Mr.	Ridley	's	announcement	,	following	their	temporary	suspension	on	London	's	Stock	Exchange	.
In	late	trading	,	the	shares	were	up	a	whopping	122	pence	-LRB-	$	1.93	*U*	-RRB-	--	a	16.3	%	gain	--	to	a	record	869	pence	on	very	heavy	volume	of	9.7	million	shares	.
In	the	U.S.	over-the-counter	market	,	Jaguar	shares	trading	as	American	Depositary	Receipts	closed	at	$	13.625	*U*	,	up	$	1.75	*U*	.
Analysts	expect	0	Ford	will	make	the	first	move	,	perhaps	today	,	with	an	initial	offer	of	about	900	pence	-LRB-	$	14.25	*U*	-RRB-	a	share	.
Such	a	proposal	values	Jaguar	at	more	than	#	1.6	billion	*U*	-LRB-	$	2.53	billion	*U*	-RRB-	.
Speculation	about	a	takeover	fight	has	sent	Jaguar	shares	soaring	in	the	past	six	weeks	.
The	share	price	was	languishing	at	about	400	pence	before	Ford	's	Sept.	19	announcement	of	its	interest	in	a	minority	stake	.
Ford	is	``	in	the	driving	seat	at	the	moment	,	''	observed	0	*T*-1	Bob	Barber	,	an	auto	analyst	at	brokers	James	Capel	&	Co	.
An	aggressive	Ford	bid	for	Jaguar	would	put	pressure	*ICH*-1	on	GM	*	to	make	a	better	offer	as	the	British	company	's	``	white	knight	.	''
Such	a	countermove	could	end	Jaguar	's	hopes	for	*	remaining	independent	and	British-owned	.
But	it	*EXP*-1	is	n't	clear	how	long	GM	would	be	willing	*-3	to	fight	Ford	for	Jaguar	*T*-2	.
Because	of	their	longstanding	rivalry	,	GM	just	``	wants	*-1	to	make	sure	0	Ford	pays	a	huge	packet	for	-LRB-	Jaguar	-RRB-	,	''	said	0	*T*-2	John	Lawson	,	an	auto	analyst	at	London	's	Nomura	Research	Institute	.
People	close	to	the	GM-Jaguar	talks	agreed	that	Ford	now	may	be	able	*-1	to	shut	out	General	Motors	.
``	It	's	either	going	*-1	to	be	a	shootout	,	or	there	only	may	be	one	player	in	town	,	''	one	person	said	*T*-2	.
Another	person	close	to	the	talks	said	,	0	``	It	*EXP*-2	is	very	hard	*	to	justify	*-3	paying	a	silly	price	for	Jaguar	if	an	out-and-out	bidding	war	were	*-1	to	start	now	.	''
In	a	statement	,	Jaguar	's	board	said	0	they	``	were	not	consulted	*-2	about	the	-LRB-	Ridley	decision	-RRB-	in	advance	and	were	surprised	*-2	at	the	action	taken	*-1	.	''
The	statement	emphasized	that	holders	representing	75	%	of	the	shares	voting	at	a	special	shareholders	'	meeting	must	agree	*-1	to	lift	the	takeover	restrictions	.
Jaguar	officials	in	the	U.S.	noted	that	Ford	,	as	Jaguar	's	largest	shareholder	,	now	has	the	power	*	to	call	for	such	a	meeting	.
U.S.	auto	analysts	also	noted	that	Ford	is	in	the	best	position	0	*	to	benefit	from	the	large	number	of	Jaguar	shares	that	*T*-67	have	moved	over	the	past	month	into	the	hands	of	arbitragers	waiting	for	the	highest	takeover	bid	*T*-2	.
Jaguar	's	own	defenses	against	a	hostile	bid	are	weakened	*-41	,	analysts	add	0	*T*-2	,	because	fewer	than	3	%	of	its	shares	are	owned	*-42	by	employees	and	management	.
Ford	officials	in	the	U.S.	declined	*-2	to	comment	on	the	British	government	's	action	or	on	any	plans	*	to	call	a	special	Jaguar	shareholders	meeting	.
But	GM	officials	said	0	they	,	too	,	were	surprised	*-43	by	the	move	,	which	*T*-68	left	them	to	``	consider	all	our	options	and	explore	matters	further	.	''
Although	GM	has	U.S.	approval	*-1	to	buy	up	to	15	%	of	Jaguar	's	stock	,	it	has	n't	yet	disclosed	how	many	shares	it	now	owns	*T*-3	.
In	a	prepared	statement	,	GM	suggested	0	its	plans	for	Jaguar	would	be	more	valuable	*ICH*-2	in	the	long	run	than	the	initial	windfalls	0	investors	might	reap	*T*-1	from	a	hostile	Ford	bid	.
``	Our	intensive	discussions	with	Jaguar	,	at	their	invitation	,	''	GM	said	*T*-1	,	``	have	as	their	objectives	*	to	create	a	cooperative	business	relationship	with	Jaguar	that	*T*-69	would	provide	for	the	continued	independence	of	this	great	British	car	company	,	to	ensure	a	secure	future	for	its	employees	and	to	provide	an	attractive	long-term	return	for	its	shareholders	.	''
Jaguar	was	shocked	*-44	by	Mr.	Ridley	's	decision	,	because	management	had	believed	0	the	government	would	n't	lift	the	golden	share	without	*-1	consulting	the	company	first	.
Indeed	,	the	government	is	taking	a	calculated	risk	.
Mr.	Ridley	's	announcement	set	off	a	howl	of	protests	from	members	of	the	opposition	Labor	Party	,	who	*T*-70	accused	the	Thatcher	administration	of	*-1	backing	down	on	promised	protection	for	a	privatized	company	.
The	British	government	retained	the	single	golden	share	after	*-1	selling	its	stake	in	Jaguar	in
The	Conservative	government	's	decision	may	reflect	its	desire	*	to	shed	a	politically	sensitive	issue	well	before	the	next	election	,	expected	*	in	late	1991	.
``	It	's	now	a	very	good	time	politically	0	*	to	get	this	over	and	done	with	*T*-3	,	''	observed	*T*-4	Daniel	Jones	,	professor	of	motor	industry	management	at	the	University	of	Cardiff	in	Wales	.
The	government	,	already	buffeted	*	by	high	interest	rates	and	a	slowing	economy	,	has	been	badly	hurt	*-1	by	last	week	's	shake-up	in	Mrs.	Thatcher	's	cabinet	.
At	the	same	time	,	the	government	did	n't	want	*-1	to	appear	*-2	to	favor	GM	by	*-2	allowing	a	minority	stake	that	*T*-71	might	preclude	a	full	bid	by	Ford	.
Mr.	Ridley	hinted	at	this	motive	in	*-1	answering	questions	from	members	of	Parliament	after	his	announcement	.
He	said	0	he	was	giving	up	the	golden	share	``	*-1	to	clear	the	way	so	the	playing	field	is	level	between	all	contestants	.	''

The	golden	share	dates	from	Jaguar	's	public	offering	in	1984	and	was	designed	*-1	to	protect	the	company	from	takeover	.

The	percentage	change	is	since	year-end	.
French	consumer	prices	rose	0.2	%	in	September	from	the	previous	month	and	were	up	3.4	%	from	a	year	earlier	,	according	to	definitive	figures	from	the	National	Statistics	Institute	.

The	index	is	based	*-57	on	1980	equaling	100	.
A	breakdown	showed	that	food	prices	were	the	most	active	part	of	growth	with	a	rise	of	0.6	%	.
An	official	linked	the	gain	essentially	to	higher	prices	for	beef	and	pork	.
He	said	0	summer	drought	problems	that	*T*-81	had	hit	several	southern	agricultural	regions	had	stopped	*-1	being	a	major	source	of	price	pressure	in	September	.
Japan	's	index	of	leading	indicators	rose	to	63.6	*ICH*-3	in	August	,	above	the	so-called	boom-or-bust	line	of	50	for	the	first	time	since	May	,	the	Economic	Planning	Agency	said	*T*-1	.

The	index	is	intended	*-1	to	measure	future	economic	performance	.
A	figure	above	50	indicates	0	the	economy	is	likely	*-1	to	expand	;	one	below	50	indicates	0	a	contraction	may	be	ahead	.

Yields	on	savings-type	certificates	of	deposit	dropped	slightly	in	the	week	ended	yesterday	.
The	average	yield	on	a	six-month	CD	of	$	50,000	*U*	or	less	was	7.90	%	,	compared	with	7.94	%	a	week	earlier	.
The	average	one-year	savings-type	CD	was	down	to	7.99	%	from	8.01	%	,	according	to	Banxquote	Money	Markets	,	a	New	York	information	service	that	*T*-83	tracks	CD	yields	.
``	This	week	was	uneventful	for	the	CD	market	,	''	said	*T*-1	Norberto	Mehl	,	chairman	of	Banxquote	.
``	The	major	banks	have	n't	even	reacted	to	sharp	rises	in	the	three-month	Treasury	bill	rates	''	in	the	past	two	weeks	.
Banks	that	*T*-84	adjusted	payouts	on	CDs	in	the	most	recent	week	made	only	fractional	moves	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	CD	trend	runs	*-1	counter	to	the	direction	of	short-term	interest	rates	at	the	Treasury	bill	auction	Monday	.
The	average	six-month	bill	was	sold	*-60	with	a	yield	of	8.04	%	,	up	from	7.90	%	.
The	average	three-month	issue	rose	to	8.05	%	from	7.77	%	.
Typically	,	banks	offer	CD	yields	higher	than	those	on	Treasury	bills	,	which	*T*-1	are	considered	*-61	the	safest	short-term	investments	;	banks	need	a	competitive	edge	*-2	to	sell	their	products	.
But	when	market	interest	rates	move	up	rapidly	*T*-1	,	increases	in	bank	CD	yields	sometimes	lag	.
Most	yields	on	short-term	jumbo	CDs	,	those	with	denominations	over	$	90,000	*U*	,	also	moved	in	the	opposite	direction	of	Treasury	bill	yields	.
The	average	six-month	yield	on	a	jumbo	CD	was	at	7.90	%	,	down	from	7.93	%	,	Banxquote	said	0	*T*-1	.
For	longer-term	CDs	,	yields	were	up	.
The	average	two-year	and	five-year	jumbos	were	up	0.02	of	a	percentage	point	to	7.91	%	and	7.96	%	,	respectively	.
However	,	CDs	sold	*	through	major	broker-dealer	networks	were	up	slightly	almost	across	the	board	.
The	average	six-month	CD	in	that	category	added	0.05	percentage	point	to	8.35	%	,	for	example	.
Mr.	Mehl	attributed	the	rise	specifically	to	the	Treasury	bill	increase	.
Among	the	major	banks	surveyed	*	by	Banxquote	in	six	regions	of	the	country	,	8.33	%	is	the	highest	yield	available	.
It	is	offered	*-62	by	the	flagship	banks	of	New	York	's	Manufacturers	Hanover	Corp.	in	the	one-year	maturity	only	.
The	yield	is	offered	*-63	across	a	range	of	maturities	at	San	Francisco	's	BankAmerica	Corp.	and	Wells	Fargo	&	Co	.
Just	two	weeks	ago	,	BankAmerica	's	yields	in	many	of	those	maturities	was	8.61	%	.
Still	,	on	average	,	the	major	California	banks	have	the	highest	yields	on	CDs	,	according	to	Banxquote	.
The	average	yield	there	on	six-month	issues	is	8.32	%	.
I	had	*-3	to	reach	back	to	French	101	when	the	monsieur	avec	clipboard	leaned	over	my	shoulder	during	the	coffee	phase	of	dinner	and	asked	whether	I	wanted	*-2	to	ride	in	a	montgolfiere	*T*-1	.
I	was	a	last-minute	-LRB-	*	read	interloping	-RRB-	attendee	at	a	French	journalism	convention	and	so	far	the	festivities	had	been	taken	*-64	up	entirely	by	eating	,	drinking	,	smoking	,	sleeping	and	drinking	.
The	man	with	the	clipboard	represented	a	halfhearted	attempt	*	to	introduce	a	bit	of	les	sportif	into	our	itinerary	.
But	as	the	French	embody	a	Zen-like	state	of	blase	when	it	comes	to	athletics	*T*-1	-LRB-	*	try	*-2	finding	a	Nautilus	machine	in	Paris	-RRB-	,	my	fellow	conventioners	were	having	none	of	it	.
The	diners	at	my	table	simply	lit	more	Gauloises	and	scoffed	at	the	suggestion	of	*	interrupting	a	perfectly	good	Saturday	morning	*-1	to	go	golfing	or	even	montgolfing	-LRB-	ballooning	to	you	;	the	brothers	Montgolfier	,	French	of	course	,	were	the	world	's	first	hot-air	balloonists	-RRB-	.
Back	in	the	U.S.A.	this	kind	of	chi-chi	airborne	activity	wins	heartwarmingly	covetous	responses	.
As	in	:	``	You	went	ballooning	?	?	!	!
In	France	?	?	!	!	''
Americans	it	seems	0	*T*-1	have	followed	Malcolm	Forbes	's	hot-air	lead	and	taken	to	ballooning	in	a	heady	way	.
During	the	past	25	years	,	the	number	of	balloonists	-LRB-	those	who	*T*-85	have	passed	a	Federal	Aviation	Authority	lighter-than-air	test	-RRB-	have	swelled	from	a	couple	hundred	to	several	thousand	,	with	some	estimates	running	*-1	as	high	as	10,000	.
Some	30	balloon	shows	are	held	*-65	annually	in	the	U.S.	,	including	the	world	's	largest	convocation	of	ersatz	Phineas	Foggs	--	the	nine-day	Albuquerque	International	Balloon	Fiesta	that	*T*-86	attracts	some	800,000	enthusiasts	and	more	than	500	balloons	,	some	of	which	*T*-1	are	fetchingly	shaped	*-2	to	resemble	Carmen	Miranda	,	Garfield	or	a	12-story-high	condom	.
-LRB-	The	condom	balloon	was	denied	*-66	official	entry	status	this	year	.	-RRB-
But	in	Epinal	,	a	gray	16th-century	river	town	adjacent	to	France	's	Vosges	mountain	region	,	none	of	these	Yankee-come-lately	enthusiasms	for	things	aloft	was	evident	.
Ballooning	at	the	de	rigueur	hour	of	6	a.m.	held	all	the	attraction	*ICH*-1	for	most	people	of	sunrise	root-canal	work	.
*-1	Feeling	the	naggings	of	a	culture	imperative	,	I	promptly	signed	up	.
The	first	thing	0	anybody	will	tell	you	*T*-1	about	ballooning	is	that	it	requires	zip	in	the	way	of	athletic	prowess	,	or	even	a	measure	of	derring-do	.
-LRB-	So	long	as	you	do	n't	look	down	.	-RRB-
They	will	also	tell	you	that	even	if	you	hate	heights	,	you	can	still	balloon	.
-LRB-	I	still	say	*	do	n't	look	down	.
At	least	not	when	you	are	ascending	*T*-1	.	-RRB-
What	they	wo	n't	tell	you	*T*-1	is	*	not	to	go	aloft	in	anything	0	you	do	n't	want	*-3	to	get	*T*-2	wet	.
I	'm	not	referring	to	the	traditional	champagne	drenching	during	the	back-on-terra-firma	toast	.
I	'm	talking	about	*	landing	in	a	canal	.
In	a	porous	wicker	basket	.
With	a	pilot	who	*T*-87	speaks	no	English	.
To	wit	,	my	maiden	voyage	-LRB-	and	novitiates	are	referred	to	*-1	as	virgins	-RRB-	began	at	dawn	on	a	dew-sodden	fairway	and	ended	at	noon	in	a	soggy	field	.
-LRB-	Balloon	flights	almost	always	occur	at	dawn	or	dusk	,	when	the	winds	are	lightest	*T*-1	.	-RRB-
In	between	came	lots	of	coffee	drinking	while	*	watching	the	balloons	inflate	and	lots	of	*	standing	around	*-1	deciding	who	*T*-88	would	fly	in	what	balloon	and	in	what	order	-LRB-	the	baskets	hold	no	more	than	four	passengers	-RRB-	.
When	it	was	n't	my	turn	in	the	balloon	*T*-2	I	followed	its	progress	from	the	``	chase	car	,	''	*-1	listening	to	the	driver	holler	into	a	walkie-talkie	.
After	long	stretches	of	this	attendant	ground	activity	came	20	or	so	lovely	minutes	of	*	drifting	above	the	Vosges	*-1	watching	the	silver	mists	rise	off	the	river	and	the	French	cows	amble	about	the	fields	.
It	*EXP*-1	's	hard	*	not	to	feel	that	God	's	in	his	heaven	with	this	kind	of	bird's-eye	view	of	the	world	,	even	if	your	pilote	in	silly	plaid	beret	kept	pointing	out	how	``	belle	''	it	all	was	*T*-2	.
Eventually	little	French	farmers	and	their	little	French	farmwives	came	out	of	their	stone	houses	and	put	their	hands	above	their	tiny	eyes	and	squinted	at	us	.
No	wonder	.
We	were	coming	down	straight	into	their	canal	.
*	See	,	the	other	rule	of	thumb	about	ballooning	is	that	you	ca	n't	steer	.
And	neither	can	your	pilot	*?*	.
You	can	go	only	up	or	down	-LRB-	by	*-1	heating	the	balloon	's	air	with	a	propane	burner	,	which	*T*-89	does	make	the	top	of	your	head	feel	hot	-RRB-	and	ride	the	air	currents	.
Which	*T*-90	makes	the	chase	car	necessary	.
Most	balloonists	seldom	go	higher	than	2,000	feet	and	most	average	a	leisurely	5-10	miles	an	hour	.
When	the	balloon	is	cruising	along	at	a	steady	altitude	*T*-1	there	is	little	sense	of	motion	.
Only	when	one	is	ascending	--	or	in	our	case	descending	a	tad	trop	rapidement	--	*T*-1	does	one	feel	,	well	,	airborne	in	a	picnic	basket	.
``	What	's	he	doing	*T*-93	?	''	hissed	*T*-1	my	companion	,	who	*T*-91	was	the	only	other	English-speaking	member	of	the	convention	and	whose	knuckles	*T*-92	were	white	.
``	Attention	,	''	yelled	*T*-1	our	pilot	as	our	basket	plunged	into	the	canal	.
``	You	bet	attention	,	''	I	yelled	back	*T*-2	,	*-1	leaping	atop	the	propane	tanks	,	``	I	'm	wearing	alligator	loafers	!	''
Our	pilot	simply	laughed	,	fired	up	the	burner	and	with	another	blast	of	flame	lifted	us	,	oh	,	a	good	12-inches	above	the	water	level	.
We	scuttled	along	for	a	few	feet	before	he	plunged	us	into	the	drink	again	.
Eventually	we	came	*-1	to	rest	in	a	soggy	patch	of	field	where	we	had	the	exquisite	pleasure	of	*	scrambling	out	of	the	basket	into	the	mud	while	the	French	half	of	our	ballooning	tag	team	scrambled	in	*T*-2	.
I	looked	at	my	watch	.
Barely	half-an-hour	aloft	.
Back	in	the	chase	car	,	we	drove	around	some	more	,	got	stuck	*-1	in	a	ditch	,	enlisted	the	aid	of	a	local	farmer	0	*T*-2	to	get	out	the	trailer	hitch	and	pull	us	out	of	the	ditch	.
We	finally	rendezvoused	with	our	balloon	,	which	*T*-94	had	come	*-1	to	rest	on	a	dirt	road	amid	a	clutch	of	Epinalers	who	*T*-95	watched	us	disassemble	our	craft	--	another	half-an-hour	of	non-flight	activity	--	that	*T*-96	included	the	precision	routine	of	*	yanking	the	balloon	to	the	ground	,	punching	all	the	air	out	of	it	,	rolling	it	up	and	cramming	it	and	the	basket	into	the	trailer	.
It	was	the	most	exercise	0	we	'd	had	*T*-1	all	morning	and	it	was	followed	*-67	by	our	driving	immediately	to	the	nearest	watering	hole	.
This	meant	*	returning	to	the	golf	course	,	where	we	watched	a	few	French	duffers	maul	the	first	tee	while	we	sat	under	Cinzano	umbrellas	,	me	nursing	an	espresso	and	my	ego	*T*-1	.
A	whole	morning	of	ballooning	and	I	had	been	off	the	ground	barely	30	minutes	.
Still	,	I	figured	0	the	event	's	envy-quotient	back	in	the	U.S.A.	was	near	peerless	.
As	for	the	ride	back	to	camp	,	our	pilot	and	all	the	other	French-speaking	passengers	clambered	into	the	chase	car	.
My	American	companion	and	I	were	left	*-1	to	ride	alfresco	in	the	wicker	basket	.
As	we	streaked	by	a	blase	gendarme	,	I	could	n't	resist	*-1	rearing	up	on	my	soggy	loafers	and	saluting	.

Treasury	Undersecretary	David	Mulford	defended	the	Treasury	's	efforts	*ICH*-1	this	fall	*	to	drive	down	the	value	of	the	dollar	,	*-2	saying	0	it	helped	*-3	minimize	damage	from	the	190-point	drop	in	the	stock	market	Oct.	13	.
*-1	Testifying	before	a	House	subcommittee	,	Mr.	Mulford	said	that	if	the	Treasury	had	n't	intervened	in	foreign-exchange	markets	in	September	and	early	October	*-2	to	reduce	the	dollar	's	value	,	the	plunge	in	the	stock	market	might	have	provoked	a	steep	fall	in	the	currency	that	*T*-97	might	have	``	unhinged	financial	markets	.	''
Mr.	Mulford	,	*-1	responding	to	critics	of	intervention	,	also	said	0	intervention	is	``	highly	visible	,	''	is	taken	*-3	seriously	by	financial	markets	and	works	better	than	``	*	was	recognized	*-68	some	time	ago	.	''
Differences	between	the	Treasury	and	the	Federal	Reserve	on	the	usefulness	of	intervention	0	*T*-1	to	help	*-2	restrain	the	dollar	resurfaced	at	the	hearing	.
Fed	Vice	Chairman	Manuel	Johnson	,	who	*T*-98	had	dissented	from	the	Treasury	's	policy	,	told	lawmakers	,	``	I	became	convinced	about	what	*T*-99	looked	to	me	like	an	attempt	*	to	push	the	dollar	down	against	the	fundamentals	in	the	market	.	''
Intervention	,	he	added	0	*T*-1	,	is	useful	*-2	only	to	smooth	disorderly	markets	,	not	to	fundamentally	influence	the	dollar	's	value	.
Rep.	John	LaFalce	-LRB-	D.	,	N.Y	.	-RRB-	said	0	Mr.	Johnson	refused	*-1	to	testify	jointly	with	Mr.	Mulford	and	instead	asked	*-1	to	appear	after	the	Treasury	official	had	completed	his	testimony	.
A	Fed	spokesman	denied	Mr.	LaFalce	's	statement	.
Mr.	Mulford	said	0	reports	of	tension	between	the	Treasury	and	Fed	have	been	exaggerated	,	*-1	insisting	that	they	involved	``	nuances	.	''
Mr.	Johnson	also	said	that	``	in	the	scheme	of	things	,	these	things	are	minor	.	''
On	other	matters	,	Mr.	Mulford	said	0	West	Germany	is	contributing	to	imbalances	in	the	world	economy	because	of	its	success	as	an	exporter	.
``	The	solution	is	stronger	domestic	growth	-LCB-	in	Germany	-RCB-	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
But	because	the	growth	of	the	German	economy	has	been	stronger	than	*	expected	*-2	,	Mr.	Mulford	said	0	*T*-1	,	it	*EXP*-3	's	difficult	for	the	U.S.	to	argue	that	Germany	ought	*-4	to	adopt	more	stimulative	monetary	and	fiscal	policies	.
Germany	's	trade	surplus	is	largely	with	other	European	countries	rather	than	with	the	U.S.	,	Mr.	Mulford	acknowledged	0	*T*-1	.
But	nonetheless	U.S.	companies	might	be	more	successful	in	European	markets	if	not	for	the	German	export	push	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
Five	officials	of	this	investment	banking	firm	*ICH*-1	were	elected	*-69	directors	:	E.	Garrett	Bewkes	III	,	a	38-year-old	managing	director	in	the	mergers	and	acquisitions	department	;	Michael	R.	Dabney	,	44	,	a	managing	director	who	*T*-100	directs	the	principal	activities	group	which	*T*-101	provides	funding	for	leveraged	acquisitions	;	Richard	Harriton	,	53	,	a	general	partner	who	*T*-102	heads	the	correspondent	clearing	services	;	Michael	Minikes	,	46	,	a	general	partner	who	*T*-103	is	treasurer	;	and	William	J.	Montgoris	,	42	,	a	general	partner	who	*T*-104	is	also	senior	vice	president	of	finance	and	chief	financial	officer	.
The	board	increased	by	one	to	26	members	.
In	the	past	year	,	one	inside	director	resigned	,	while	three	others	retired	.
Some	U.S.	allies	are	complaining	that	President	Bush	is	pushing	conventional-arms	talks	too	quickly	,	*-1	creating	a	risk	that	negotiators	will	make	errors	that	*T*-105	could	affect	the	security	of	Western	Europe	for	years	.
Concerns	about	the	pace	of	the	Vienna	talks	--	which	*T*-1	are	aimed	*-71	at	the	destruction	of	some	100,000	weapons	,	as	well	as	major	reductions	and	realignments	of	troops	in	central	Europe	--	also	are	being	registered	*-70	at	the	Pentagon	.
Mr.	Bush	has	called	for	an	agreement	by	next	September	at	the	latest	.
But	some	American	defense	officials	believe	0	the	North	Atlantic	Treaty	Organization	should	take	more	time	*-1	to	examine	the	long-term	implications	of	the	options	being	considered	*	.
For	one	thing	,	Pentagon	officials	,	who	*T*-106	asked	*-3	not	to	be	identified	*-4	,	worry	that	the	U.S.	will	have	a	much	tougher	time	*-2	persuading	Europeans	*-5	to	keep	some	short-range	nuclear	weapons	on	their	soil	once	Soviet	armored	forces	are	thinned	*-1	out	.
At	the	same	time	,	they	contend	that	a	reduction	of	NATO	forces	under	a	treaty	will	increase	the	possibility	of	a	conventional	Soviet	attack	unless	the	West	retains	a	residual	force	of	nuclear	weapons	in	Europe	.
Allies	concerned	about	the	deadline	include	the	British	,	French	and	smaller	NATO	allies	,	some	of	whom	*T*-107	do	n't	have	adequate	staffs	0	*T*-1	to	provide	quick	answers	to	the	questions	being	raised	*	by	what	*T*-2	generally	are	considered	*-72	the	most	complex	arms-control	talks	ever	attempted	*	.
So	far	,	no	ally	has	complained	openly	,	*	preserving	the	impression	that	NATO	is	in	line	with	the	Bush	position	that	a	quick	agreement	bringing	Soviet	conventional	forces	down	to	parity	with	NATO	is	the	West	's	top	bargaining	priority	.
But	even	though	NATO	negotiators	have	only	10	months	left	*	under	the	Bush	timetable	,	they	are	still	wrestling	over	such	seemingly	fundamental	questions	as	``	What	*T*-108	is	a	tank	?	''
Five	of	the	six	categories	of	weapons	under	negotiation	have	n't	even	been	defined	*-73	.
Tanks	currently	are	defined	*-74	as	armored	vehicles	weighing	25	tons	or	more	that	*T*-1	carry	large	guns	.
The	Soviets	complicated	the	issue	by	*-1	offering	*-2	to	include	light	tanks	,	which	*T*-109	are	as	light	as	10	tons	.
Oleg	A.	Grinevsky	,	the	chief	Soviet	negotiator	in	the	conventional-arms	talks	,	argued	that	this	would	mean	0	the	Soviets	would	have	*-1	to	destroy	some	1,800	tanks	,	while	the	U.S.	would	lose	none	because	it	has	no	light	tanks	in	Europe	.
But	the	issue	is	stickier	than	it	seems	*?*	.
France	,	Britain	and	Italy	all	have	light	tanks	0	they	would	like	*-2	to	keep	*T*-1	out	of	the	talks	.
And	some	U.S.	Army	analysts	worry	that	the	proposed	Soviet	redefinition	is	aimed	*-75	at	*-1	blocking	the	U.S.	from	*-2	developing	lighter	,	more	transportable	,	high-technology	tanks	.
*	Defining	combat	aircraft	is	even	tougher	.
The	Soviets	insisted	that	aircraft	be	brought	*-76	into	the	talks	,	then	argued	for	*	exempting	some	4,000	Russian	planes	because	they	are	``	solely	defensive	.	''
NATO	has	n't	budged	from	its	insistence	that	any	gun-carrying	plane	has	offensive	capability	.
The	dispute	over	that	issue	,	according	to	one	U.S.	official	,	is	a	``	potential	treaty	stopper	,	''	and	only	President	Bush	and	Soviet	leader	Mikhail	Gorbachev	may	be	able	*-1	to	resolve	it	.
Accounting	problems	raise	more	knotty	issues	.
Greece	and	Turkey	,	for	example	,	are	suspected	*-77	of	*-1	overstating	their	arsenals	in	hopes	that	they	can	emerge	from	the	arms-reduction	treaty	with	large	remaining	forces	0	*T*-2	to	deter	each	other	.
Other	nations	are	n't	sure	how	many	weapons	they	have	*T*-1	in	their	own	arsenals	.
``	It	's	just	going	*-2	to	be	sloppy	,	both	on	our	side	and	theirs	-LCB-	the	Warsaw	Pact	's	-RCB-	,	''	says	*T*-1	one	NATO	analyst	.
So	far	,	neither	the	Bush	administration	nor	arms-control	experts	in	Congress	seem	*-1	moved	*-2	by	arguments	that	these	problems	*ICH*-4	may	take	more	time	*ICH*-5	0	*	to	thrash	*T*-3	out	than	President	Bush	has	allowed	*?*	.
They	argue	that	the	bigger	danger	would	be	that	the	West	would	delay	action	so	long	that	the	Soviets	might	back	away	from	the	current	conciliatory	attitude	.
``	So	what	if	you	miss	50	tanks	somewhere	?	''	asks	*T*-1	Rep.	Norman	Dicks	-LRB-	D.	,	Wash.	-RRB-	,	a	member	of	the	House	group	that	*T*-110	visited	the	talks	in	Vienna	.
``	The	bottom	line	is	that	if	we	can	get	that	-LCB-	Warsaw	Pact	-RCB-	superiority	brought	*-1	down	to	parity	,	we	ought	*-2	to	keep	*-3	pressing	ahead	as	quickly	as	possible	.
I	worry	more	about	things	becoming	so	unraveled	*ICH*-2	on	the	other	side	that	they	might	become	unable	*-1	to	negotiate	.
International	Lease	Finance	Corp.	announced	a	leasing	contract	with	charter	carrier	American	Trans	Air	Inc.	,	in	a	transaction	involving	six	Boeing	Co.	757-200s	.
The	value	of	the	jets	,	including	spares	,	is	in	excess	of	$	250	million	*U*	.
Two	of	the	757-200s	are	new	aircraft	0	*T*-1	to	be	delivered	*-78	to	American	Trans	Air	,	the	main	subsidiary	of	Amtran	Inc.	,	in	December	1991	and	January	1992	.
Four	of	the	planes	were	purchased	*-79	by	International	Lease	from	Singapore	Airlines	in	a	previously	announced	transaction	.
Delivery	of	the	first	aircraft	is	set	*-3	for	early	November	,	a	second	for	December	and	two	for	April	1990	.
Norway	's	unemployment	rate	for	October	was	3.6	%	,	unchanged	from	September	but	up	from	2.6	%	in	the	same	month	last	year	.
The	figure	excludes	a	record	number	employed	*	by	extraordinary	government	work	programs	,	the	Labor	Directorate	announced	0	*T*-2	Tuesday	.
Including	those	in	the	state	programs	,	there	were	143,800	Norwegians	*ICH*-1	,	or	about	6.5	%	of	the	work	force	,	without	permanent	employment	in	October	,	up	from	September	's	136,800	.
The	number	of	people	registered	*	as	jobless	at	the	end	of	October	declined	by	900	from	September	to	78,600	.
Those	employed	*	in	state-funded	special	programs	increased	by	7,400	to	65,200	in	the	same	period	,	the	Directorate	said	0	*T*-2	.
In	October	1988	,	there	were	40,800	fewer	employed	*	by	government	programs	.
Coca-Cola	Co.	,	*-1	aiming	*-2	to	boost	soft-drink	volume	in	Singapore	,	said	0	it	is	discussing	a	joint	venture	with	Fraser	&	Neave	Ltd.	,	its	bottling	franchisee	in	that	country	.
The	venture	would	be	the	latest	in	Coke	's	rapid	expansion	of	overseas	investment	.
So	far	this	year	,	it	has	put	nearly	$	700	million	*U*	into	bottling	operations	in	Australia	,	New	Zealand	and	France	.
The	move	also	reflects	Coke	's	eagerness	*	to	have	a	hand	in	*	developing	the	soft-drink	markets	in	Pacific	Basin	countries	.
Aside	from	Europe	,	the	Pacific	division	is	where	Coke	will	be	focusing	much	of	its	attention	for	years	0	*T*-2	to	come	*T*-1	.
That	's	because	when	Coke	looks	to	the	Pacific	area	*T*-1	,	it	sees	an	economic	and	demographic	gold	mine	.
In	countries	such	as	Taiwan	,	South	Korea	and	Singapore	,	economies	are	growing	,	*	resulting	in	a	rise	in	disposable	income	that	consumers	can	use	*T*-111	for	soft	drinks	.
And	unlike	Europe	and	the	U.S.	,	where	populations	are	aging	*T*-1	,	the	Pacific	Basin	countries	have	growing	proportions	of	youths	--	the	heaviest	consumers	of	Coca-Cola	and	other	sodas	.
A	Coca-Cola	spokesman	said	0	it	is	too	early	*	to	say	how	the	joint	venture	would	be	structured	*T*-1	,	or	how	much	the	company	would	invest	*T*-3	in	the	transaction	.
In	the	past	,	however	,	Coke	has	typically	taken	a	minority	stake	in	such	ventures	.
By	*-1	acquiring	stakes	in	bottling	companies	in	the	U.S.	and	overseas	,	Coke	has	been	able	*-1	to	improve	bottlers	'	efficiency	and	production	,	and	in	some	cases	,	marketing	.
Coke	has	tended	*-1	to	increase	its	control	when	results	were	sluggish	in	a	given	country	*T*-2	.
That	does	n't	appear	*-1	to	be	the	case	in	Singapore	,	a	country	of	about	three	million	people	with	a	relatively	high	soft-drink	consumption	rate	--	a	key	indicator	of	Coke	's	success	in	a	market	.
In	Singapore	,	per-capita	consumption	is	about	one-third	that	of	the	U.S.	.
And	*	combining	Fraser	&	Neave	's	own	soft	drinks	with	Coca-Cola	's	gives	the	Singapore	company	more	than	half	the	share	of	the	soda	market	there	,	Coke	said	0	*T*-1	.
Fraser	&	Neave	,	which	*T*-1	also	has	interests	in	packaging	,	beer	and	dairy	products	,	holds	the	Coke	licenses	for	Malaysia	and	Brunei	,	where	per-capita	consumption	is	n't	as	high	as	in	Singapore	*T*-2	.
Coke	could	be	interested	in	*-1	more	quickly	developing	some	of	the	untapped	potential	in	those	markets	.
A	Coke	spokesman	said	0	he	could	n't	say	whether	that	is	the	direction	of	the	talks	.
Coke	said	0	the	joint-venture	arrangement	,	which	*T*-112	needs	approval	from	both	companies	'	boards	,	should	be	completed	*-82	early	next	year	.
AMERICAN	BRANDS	Inc.	,	Old	Greenwich	,	Conn.	,	said	0	it	increased	its	quarterly	11	%	*ICH*-1	to	68	cents	a	share	from	61	cents	,	payable	Dec.	1	to	stock	of	record	Nov.	10	.
The	increase	follows	the	company	's	report	of	strong	earnings	for	the	third	quarter	,	and	reflects	what	American	Brands	called	*T*-113	its	``	tradition	of	*	sharing	earnings	growth	''	with	shareholders	.
American	Brands	is	a	consumer	products	company	with	core	businesses	in	tobacco	,	distilled	spirits	and	life	insurance	.
As	of	Sept.	30	,	American	Brands	had	95.2	million	shares	outstanding	.
Giovanni	Agnelli	&	Co.	announced	a	transaction	that	*T*-114	will	strengthen	its	indirect	control	of	Fiat	S.p	.	A.	and	will	admit	Prince	Karim	Aga	Khan	as	its	first	non-family	shareholder	.
Giovanni	Agnelli	,	a	limited	partnership	that	*T*-115	is	the	master	holding	company	for	Fiat	's	Agnelli	family	,	owns	approximately	75	%	of	the	shares	in	Istituto	Finanziario	Industriale	,	which	*T*-1	in	turn	owns	approximately	40	%	of	Fiat	,	Italy	's	biggest	private-sector	industrial	group	.
The	company	said	0	Maria	Sole	Agnelli	Teodorani	,	sister	of	Fiat	Chairman	Giovanni	Agnelli	,	agreed	*-1	to	trade	her	shares	in	IFI	for	new	ordinary	shares	in	the	limited	partnership	,	which	*T*-116	will	give	her	control	of	4.67	%	of	Giovanni	Agnelli	&	Co	.
The	Aga	Khan	,	meanwhile	,	agreed	*-1	to	trade	some	of	his	stake	in	Luxembourg-based	Ifint	S.A.	,	another	Agnelli	family	company	,	for	7.45	%	of	Giovanni	Agnelli	&	Co.	's	capital	.
His	new	stake	would	be	in	the	form	of	preferred	shares	,	which	*T*-117	receive	higher	dividends	but	have	voting	rights	only	in	extraordinary	shareholders	assemblies	.
The	Aga	Khan	owns	10	%	of	Ifint	's	capital	,	while	IFI	owns	23	%	.
As	a	result	of	the	transaction	,	which	*T*-118	is	expected	*-1	to	be	approved	*-83	at	a	shareholders	meeting	Nov.	24	,	Giovanni	Agnelli	&	Co.	will	control	79.18	%	of	IFI	's	ordinary	shares	.
Its	capital	will	also	be	raised	*-84	to	232.4	billion	lire	-LRB-	$	172.5	million	*U*	-RRB-	from	the	current	204.3	billion	lire	.
IFI	also	has	nonvoting	preferred	shares	,	which	*T*-1	are	quoted	*-85	on	the	Milan	stock	exchange	.
The	value	of	the	two	transactions	was	n't	disclosed	*-1	,	but	an	IFI	spokesman	said	0	no	cash	would	change	hands	.
The	move	strengthens	the	existing	links	between	the	Agnellis	and	the	Aga	Khan	,	the	head	of	the	world	's	Ismaili	Moslems	who	*T*-119	is	a	longtime	family	friend	and	*-1	frequently	goes	sailing	with	Mr.	Agnelli	.
Mr.	Agnelli	and	the	Aga	Khan	also	have	some	business	ties	,	and	a	spokesman	for	the	Agnelli	company	did	n't	rule	out	that	the	current	agreement	could	lead	to	further	collaboration	.
For	instance	,	Ifint	earlier	this	year	bought	an	18	%	stake	in	Alisarda	,	the	Aga	Khan	's	airline	,	which	*T*-120	flies	between	Italy	and	Sardinia	.
Giovanni	Agnelli	&	Co.	,	which	*T*-1	was	formed	*-86	in	January	1987	as	a	way	of	*	keeping	the	Agnellis	'	controlling	stake	in	Fiat	together	despite	an	ever-growing	family	tree	,	has	been	playing	a	more	active	role	in	the	Agnelli	group	of	late	.
It	raised	financing	of	300	billion	lire	for	the	purchase	this	summer	by	another	Agnelli-related	group	of	the	food	concern	Galbani	S.p	.	A.	,	by	*-1	selling	a	chunk	of	its	IFI	shares	to	Mediobanca	S.p	.	A.
Mediobanca	said	during	the	weekend	that	it	agreed	*-2	to	sell	the	shares	back	to	Giovanni	Agnelli	for	333	billion	lire	.
Your	Oct.	2	page-one	article	on	people	riding	so-called	``	railbikes	''	on	railroad	tracks	was	a	disservice	to	your	readers	.

The	compromise	was	a	somewhat	softened	version	of	what	the	White	House	had	said	0	it	would	accept	*T*-1	.
Under	the	agreement	with	the	House	and	Senate	leaders	,	the	minimum	wage	would	rise	from	the	current	$	3.35	*U*	an	hour	to	$	4.25	*U*	an	hour	by	April	1991	.
Employers	could	also	pay	a	subminimum	``	training	wage	''	for	90	days	to	new	workers	who	*T*-122	are	up	to	19	years	old	*NOT*	,	and	then	for	another	90	days	if	the	company	institutes	a	specific	training	program	for	the	newcomers	.
White	House	officials	were	delighted	that	the	compromise	includes	the	concept	of	a	training	wage	,	which	Mr.	Bush	has	fought	for	*T*-1	throughout	the	year	.
``	For	the	first	time	in	history	,	we	have	a	training	wage	that	*T*-123	will	be	part	''	of	the	nation	's	labor	laws	,	said	0	*T*-1	Roger	Porter	,	assistant	to	the	president	for	economic	and	domestic	policy	.
White	House	aides	said	that	although	they	made	a	small	compromise	on	the	length	of	a	training	wage	,	the	final	minimum-wage	increase	will	meet	the	standards	set	*	by	Mr.	Bush	.
The	bill	vetoed	*	by	the	president	in	June	,	which	the	House	failed	*-1	to	override	*T*-2	,	would	have	lifted	the	minimum	wage	to	$	4.55	*U*	an	hour	by	late	1991	,	with	a	training	wage	for	up	to	two	months	,	generally	for	a	worker	's	first	job	.
Mr.	Bush	had	been	holding	out	for	a	bill	boosting	the	wage	floor	to	$	4.25	*U*	an	hour	by	the	end	of	1991	,	coupled	*	with	a	six-month	training	wage	for	workers	newly	hired	*	by	any	employer	.
Under	the	compromise	,	the	$	4.25	*U*	level	would	be	reached	*-87	nine	months	earlier	,	while	the	training	subminimum	would	be	shorter	,	unless	it	is	tied	*-88	to	a	training	plan	.
Democrats	argued	that	the	training	wage	was	a	way	of	*	allowing	employers	to	pay	less	than	the	minimum	wage	,	while	new	workers	need	far	less	than	six	months	*-1	to	be	trained	*-89	for	their	jobs	.
Democrats	had	been	negotiating	with	some	Republican	congressional	leaders	on	a	compromise	lately	.
With	congressional	elections	next	year	,	GOP	leaders	have	worried	about	*-1	opposing	a	minimum-wage	rise	for	low-paid	workers	at	a	time	when	Congress	is	moving	toward	a	capital-gains	tax	cut	that	*T*-124	would	directly	benefit	wealthier	taxpayers	*T*-2	.
Republicans	have	been	imploring	the	White	House	*-1	to	compromise	on	the	wage	issue	.
In	the	Senate	,	Edward	Kennedy	-LRB-	D.	,	Mass.	-RRB-	,	chairman	of	the	Labor	Committee	,	and	Pete	Domenici	,	-LRB-	R.	,	N.M	.	-RRB-	ranking	minority	member	of	the	Budget	Committee	,	have	been	working	on	a	compromise	,	and	their	soundings	showed	that	the	Senate	appeared	*-2	to	be	heading	toward	enough	strength	*	to	override	another	Bush	veto	,	a	Democratic	staff	official	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	House	is	scheduled	*-1	to	vote	this	week	on	the	compromise	,	as	a	substitute	to	a	new	Democratic	bill	,	itself	watered	*	down	from	last	spring	's	version	.
The	Senate	will	probably	vote	not	long	afterward	.
Some	Democrats	thought	0	they	might	have	compromised	too	much	.
Rep.	Austin	Murphy	-LRB-	D.	,	Pa.	-RRB-	,	chairman	of	the	House	labor	standards	subcommittee	,	said	0	they	might	have	done	better	``	if	we	'd	held	their	feet	to	the	fire	.	''
Mr.	Kennedy	suggested	0	Democrats	``	yielded	a	great	deal	''	on	the	size	of	the	increase	,	but	he	cited	concessions	from	the	White	House	on	the	training	wage	,	which	he	said	0	*T*-2	*T*-1	make	it	``	less	harsh	.	''
With	only	16-year-olds	to	19-year-olds	eligible	,	68	%	of	workers	getting	less	than	$	4.25	*U*	an	hour	,	who	*T*-125	are	adults	,	wo	n't	be	subject	to	the	training	wage	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	AFL-CIO	,	which	*T*-126	previously	opposed	the	administration	's	subminimum	idea	,	said	0	the	compromise	has	``	adequate	safeguards	,	so	the	youth	are	not	exploited	*-1	and	older	workers	are	not	displaced	*-2	.	''

Moody	's	Investors	Service	Inc.	said	0	it	lowered	the	ratings	on	about	$	3.2	billion	*U*	of	Houston	Lighting	&	Power	Co.	's	securities	because	of	the	company	's	low	levels	of	interest	coverage	and	internal	cash	generation	.
Houston	Lighting	is	a	unit	of	Houston	Industries	Inc.	,	a	utility	holding	company	in	Houston	.
Downgraded	*-1	by	Moody	's	were	*T*-3	Houston	Lighting	's	first-mortgage	bonds	and	secured	pollution-control	bonds	to	single-A-3	from	single-A-2	;	unsecured	pollution-control	bonds	to	Baa-1	from	single-A-3	;	preferred	stock	to	single-A-3	from	single-A-2	;	a	shelf	registration	for	preferred	stock	to	a	preliminary	rating	of	single-A-3	from	a	preliminary	rating	of	single-A-2	;	two	shelf	registrations	for	collateralized	debt	securities	to	a	preliminary	rating	of	single-A-3	from	a	preliminary	rating	of	single-A-2	,	and	the	unit	's	rating	for	commercial	paper	to	Prime-2	from	Prime-1	.
Moody	's	said	0	Houston	Lighting	's	current	situation	has	some	positive	aspects	,	including	*	managing	``	very	well	''	the	construction	and	commercial	operation	risks	of	Units	1	and	2	of	the	South	Texas	Project	nuclear	power	plant	.

Armstrong	World	Industries	Inc.	agreed	in	principle	*-1	to	sell	its	carpet	operations	to	Shaw	Industries	Inc	.
The	price	was	n't	disclosed	*-1	but	one	analyst	estimated	that	it	was	$	150	million	*U*	.
Armstrong	,	which	*T*-127	has	faced	a	takeover	threat	from	the	Belzberg	family	of	Canada	since	July	,	said	that	*	disposing	of	the	carpet	business	would	improve	``	total	financial	performance	.	''
The	move	also	would	allow	the	company	to	concentrate	on	core	businesses	,	which	*T*-128	include	ceramic	tile	,	floor	coverings	and	furniture	.
Moreover	,	such	a	sale	could	help	Armstrong	reassure	its	investors	and	deter	the	Belzbergs	,	who	*T*-129	own	a	9.85	%	stake	in	the	Lancaster	,	Pa.	,	company	.
Analysts	expect	Armstrong	to	use	proceeds	of	the	sale	*-1	to	reduce	debt	,	buy	back	stock	or	perhaps	finance	an	acquisition	.
The	carpet	division	had	1988	sales	of	$	368.3	million	*U*	,	or	almost	14	%	of	Armstrong	's	$	2.68	billion	*U*	total	revenue	.
The	company	has	been	manufacturing	carpet	since	1967	.
Recently	it	upgraded	its	plants	so	that	it	could	make	stain-resistant	products	with	higher	quality	dyes	.
For	the	past	year	or	two	,	the	carpet	division	's	operating	profit	margins	have	hovered	around	5	%	,	high	by	industry	standards	,	but	disappointing	compared	with	the	13	%	to	19	%	*U*	margins	for	two	of	Armstrong	's	chief	businesses	,	flooring	and	building	products	.
Analysts	hailed	the	planned	transaction	as	*-1	being	beneficial	to	Armstrong	and	Shaw	,	the	market	leader	in	the	U.S.	carpet	industry	,	with	an	estimated	17	%	to	20	%	*U*	share	.
Shaw	,	based	*	in	Dalton	,	Ga.	,	has	annual	sales	of	about	$	1.18	billion	*U*	,	and	has	economies	of	scale	and	lower	raw-material	costs	that	*T*-130	are	expected	*-2	to	boost	the	profitability	of	Armstrong	's	brands	,	sold	*	under	the	Armstrong	and	Evans-Black	names	.
Yesterday	,	in	composite	trading	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	,	Shaw	's	shares	closed	ex-dividend	at	$	26.125	*U*	,	up	$	2.25	*U*	.
Armstrong	's	shares	,	also	listed	*	on	the	Big	Board	,	closed	at	$	39.125	*U*	,	up	12.5	cents	.
Yesterday	,	Armstrong	reported	flat	earnings	for	the	third	quarter	and	nine	months	,	worsened	*	by	the	stock	dilution	of	an	employee	stock	ownership	plan	adopted	*	earlier	this	year	.
For	the	quarter	,	earnings	were	$	47	million	*U*	,	or	92	cents	a	share	,	including	a	one-time	gain	of	$	5.9	million	*U*	.
In	the	year-ago	quarter	,	earnings	were	$	42.9	million	*U*	,	or	93	cents	a	share	.
Yesterday	,	Armstrong	announced	an	agreement	*	to	sell	its	small	Applied	Color	Systems	unit	to	a	subsidiary	of	the	Swiss	company	,	Brauerei	Eichof	Ltd	.
The	price	was	n't	disclosed	*-1	.
Armstrong	expects	*-1	to	close	the	sale	of	the	color	unit	in	late	November	and	the	carpet	sale	in	December	,	with	the	gains	to	be	applied	*-4	to	fourth	quarter	or	first-quarter	results	.
The	government	's	primary	economic-forecasting	gauge	rose	a	slight	0.2	%	in	September	,	but	economists	said	0	the	report	offered	little	new	information	on	the	degree	to	which	the	U.S.	economy	is	slowing	*T*-1	.
The	small	increase	in	the	index	of	leading	indicators	,	which	*T*-1	had	climbed	0.5	%	in	August	but	*T*-1	was	unchanged	in	July	,	does	lend	support	to	the	view	that	the	economy	has	slowed	noticeably	.
However	,	it	does	n't	give	much	of	a	clue	as	to	whether	a	recession	is	on	the	horizon	.
``	I	do	n't	think	0	it	provides	much	new	information	on	the	economy	,	''	said	*T*-1	Richard	Rippe	,	economist	at	Dean	Witter	Reynolds	Inc	.
So	far	this	year	,	the	index	of	leading	indicators	has	risen	in	four	months	,	fallen	in	four	months	and	remained	unchanged	in	the	other	month	.
In	another	report	yesterday	,	the	Commerce	Department	said	0	sales	of	new	single-family	houses	plunged	14	%	in	September	to	an	annual	rate	of	618,000	from	719,000	in	August	.
The	declines	were	particularly	pronounced	*-2	in	the	Northeast	and	in	the	South	,	where	Hurricane	Hugo	was	a	factor	*T*-1	.
Although	September	's	weakness	followed	two	strong	months	for	home	sales	,	the	decline	supports	other	indications	that	the	drop	in	mortgage	rates	earlier	this	year	has	had	only	a	limited	beneficial	effect	on	the	housing	market	.
The	September	drop	was	the	largest	since	a	19	%	drop	in	January	1982	,	but	monthly	changes	in	this	measure	are	even	less	reliable	than	those	in	other	economic	indicators	.
Because	the	figures	are	based	*-93	on	a	small	sample	,	the	department	said	0	it	is	90	%	confident	only	that	new-home	sales	fell	somewhere	between	5	%	and	23	%	during	the	month	.
The	department	also	said	0	it	*EXP*-1	takes	four	months	*	to	establish	a	trend	.
So	far	this	year	,	534,000	newly	built	homes	*ICH*-1	have	been	sold	*-94	,	down	4.5	%	from	the	like	months	of	1988	.
The	index	of	leading	indicators	got	a	major	boost	in	September	from	a	surge	in	consumer	expectations	as	*	measured	*-1	by	the	University	of	Michigan	.
This	measure	had	dropped	sharply	in	August	.
The	Commerce	Department	said	that	as	a	result	of	a	new	adjustment	to	the	formula	used	*	*	to	calculate	the	index	,	the	influence	of	this	component	has	been	reduced	*-95	.
Of	the	11	components	to	the	index	,	only	three	others	*T*-2	*ICH*-1	rose	in	September	:	the	money	supply	,	the	length	of	the	average	work	week	and	stock	prices	.
Several	components	that	*T*-131	track	the	health	of	the	manufacturing	sector	of	the	economy	turned	down	in	September	.
These	include	new	orders	for	manufactured	consumer	goods	,	lead	times	on	vendor	deliveries	,	orders	for	new	plant	and	equipment	,	and	backlogs	of	orders	for	durable	goods	.
Meanwhile	,	the	National	Association	of	Manufacturers	said	yesterday	0	a	recent	poll	of	53	executives	on	its	board	found	that	61	%	do	n't	expect	a	recession	to	occur	until	1991	or	later	.
The	remainder	expect	a	downturn	to	begin	sometime	in
Although	manufacturers	often	are	quick	*-1	to	call	for	lower	interest	rates	,	60	%	of	the	executives	said	0	they	would	prefer	that	the	Fed	keep	inflation-fighting	as	its	top	priority	even	if	that	means	higher	rates	.
The	other	40	%	said	0	the	Fed	ought	*-1	to	worry	less	about	inflation	and	bring	interest	rates	down	.
All	the	figures	are	adjusted	*-1	*	to	remove	usual	seasonal	patterns	.
Here	are	*T*-1	the	net	contributions	of	the	components	of	the	Commerce	Department	's	index	of	leading	indicators	.
After	various	adjustments	,	they	produced	a	0.5	%	rise	in	the	index	for	August	and	a	0.2	%	rise	for	September	.
September	,	and	the	change	from	August	,	are	:	from	1.11	in	the	previous	month	.
Boston	Edison	Co.	said	0	it	will	take	a	previously	reported	$	60	million	*U*	charge	against	earnings	in	the	fourth	quarter	.
The	charge	resulted	from	a	settlement	approved	*	yesterday	by	the	Massachusetts	Department	of	Public	Utilities	.
As	*	expected	*-1	,	the	settlement	limits	rate	increases	for	three	years	and	ties	future	charges	to	customers	for	operation	of	the	troubled	Pilgrim	Nuclear	Power	Station	to	that	plant	's	performance	.
In	its	order	,	the	state	regulatory	agency	said	0	the	company	``	must	be	held	*-96	accountable	for	the	mistakes	made	*	in	the	management	of	the	plant	's	operation	.	''
Pilgrim	had	been	closed	for	32	months	.
The	average	interest	rate	rose	to	8.3875	%	at	Citicorp	's	$	50	million	*U*	weekly	auction	of	91-day	commercial	paper	,	or	corporate	IOUs	,	from	8.337	%	at	last	week	's	sale	.
Bids	totaling	$	515	million	*U*	were	submitted	*-97	.
Accepted	bids	ranged	from	8.38	%	to	8.395	%	.
Citicorp	also	said	that	the	average	rate	rose	to	8.0087	%	at	its	$	50	million	*U*	auction	of	182-day	commercial	paper	from	7.962	%	at	last	week	's	sale	.
Bids	totaling	$	475	million	*U*	were	submitted	*-98	.
Accepted	bids	ranged	from	8	%	to	8.019	%	.
The	bank	holding	company	will	auction	another	$	50	million	*U*	in	each	maturity	next	Tuesday	.
An	imaginative	novelist	writing	a	thriller	about	amateur	spy-chasing	might	invent	a	Clifford	Stoll	,	but	it	's	unlikely	.
It	's	also	unnecessary	.
Amateur	spy-chaser	Clifford	Stoll	is	a	real	person	,	or	as	he	might	waggishly	put	it	,	a	surreal	person	.
He	is	37	,	an	astronomer	with	impressive	credentials	,	and	something	of	a	genius	at	*-1	making	computers	do	his	bidding	.
He	once	described	himself	as	a	``	Berkeley	Hippie	,	''	and	played	the	role	*ICH*-1	well	;	obligatory	ragged	jeans	,	a	thicket	of	long	hair	and	rejection	of	all	things	conventional	,	including	,	for	a	time	at	least	,	formal	marriage	to	his	``	sweetheart	,	''	Martha	Matthews	.
He	also	is	an	entertaining	writer	,	*-2	combining	wisecracks	and	wordplay	with	programmatic	detail	and	lucid	explanations	of	how	computers	work	*T*-1	.
In	``	The	Cuckoo	's	Egg	''	-LRB-	Doubleday	,	326	pages	,	$	19.95	*U*	-RRB-	,	he	spins	a	remarkable	tale	of	his	efforts	*ICH*-2	over	18	months	*	to	catch	a	computer	spy	.
The	result	last	spring	was	the	arrest	by	West	German	authorities	of	five	young	West	Germans	,	accused	*	of	*-1	stealing	information	from	computers	in	the	U.S.	and	Europe	and	selling	it	to	the	Soviet	KGB	.
One	of	them	,	25-year-old	Markus	Hess	of	Hannover	,	allegedly	used	the	international	telecommunications	network	*-1	to	break	into	more	than	30	high-security	computers	in	the	U.S.	,	*-2	searching	for	secrets	.
He	probably	did	n't	penetrate	any	top-secret	files	,	but	the	KGB	in	East	Berlin	was	willing	*-2	to	pay	two	of	his	associates	,	Peter	Carl	and	Dirk	Brezinski	,	$	15,000	*U*	for	some	of	the	material	0	Hess	collected	*T*-1	.
They	promised	yet	more	for	really	good	stuff	.
Mr.	Stoll	draws	his	title	from	the	cuckoo	's	habit	of	*	laying	eggs	in	the	nests	of	other	birds	,	*-1	making	them	surrogate	parents	.
The	computer	spy	had	discovered	that	a	popular	editing\/electronic	mail	program	called	*	Gnu-Emacs	could	do	tricks	with	the	widely	used	Unix	operating	system	created	*	by	AT&T	.
*-1	Using	Gnu-Emacs	,	the	spy	could	substitute	a	bogus	``	atrun	''	program	for	the	one	that	*T*-132	routinely	cleans	up	the	Unix	system	every	five	minutes	.
Once	his	cuckoo	's	egg	was	laid	*-99	,	he	could	enter	Unix	and	become	a	``	super-user	,	''	with	access	to	everything	.
Mr.	Stoll	was	scanning	the	heavens	at	the	Keck	observatory	of	the	Lawrence	Berkeley	Laboratory	in	1986	when	his	grant	ran	*-3	low	*T*-1	and	he	was	asked	*-2	to	switch	to	*	helping	run	the	lab	's	computers	*T*-1	.
He	discovered	a	75-cent	discrepancy	in	the	charges	made	*	to	various	departments	for	computer	time	and	traced	it	to	a	user	named	*	``	Hunter	,	''	who	*T*-133	had	no	valid	billing	address	.
Mr.	Stoll	suspected	0	the	intruder	was	one	of	those	precocious	students	who	*T*-134	has	fun	*-1	breaking	into	computers	.
But	after	much	tracking	,	it	*EXP*-1	became	evident	to	Mr.	Stoll	,	through	various	clues	,	that	the	hacker	was	not	on	the	Berkeley	campus	or	even	in	California	.
*	Finding	him	became	an	obsession	for	Mr.	Stoll	.
He	made	a	midnight	requisition	of	all	the	printers	0	he	could	lay	hands	on	*T*-1	so	that	he	could	monitor	all	the	telephone	lines	coming	into	the	lab	's	computers	.
After	*-3	discovering	that	the	hacker	had	taken	over	the	dormant	account	of	a	legitimate	user	named	*	Joe	Sventek	,	he	rigged	up	an	alarm	system	,	including	a	portable	beeper	,	0	*T*-1	to	alert	him	when	Sventek	came	on	the	line	*T*-2	.
Some	nights	he	slept	under	his	desk	.
His	boss	complained	about	neglect	of	other	chores	.
The	hacker	was	pawing	over	the	Berkeley	files	but	also	using	Berkeley	and	other	easily	accessible	computers	as	stepping	stones	to	the	network	of	computers	used	*	by	the	military	and	national	security	agencies	.
The	White	Sands	missile	range	and	CIA	contractor	Mitre	Inc.	were	among	the	targets	.
When	the	hacker	moved	*T*-1	,	Mr.	Stoll	moved	too	,	*-2	calling	up	other	systems	managers	*-3	to	alert	them	but	keeping	his	own	system	open	*-3	to	avoid	*-4	arousing	suspicion	.
Sometimes	,	if	the	hacker	seemed	*-1	to	be	into	a	sensitive	file	,	he	would	drag	his	keychain	across	the	terminal	*-2	to	create	static	or	slow	the	system	down	*-3	to	frustrate	his	quarry	.
The	FBI	initially	showed	little	interest	,	and	he	had	the	impression	0	other	federal	security	agencies	were	tangled	*-100	up	in	legal	red	tape	.
The	CIA	told	him	0	it	does	not	do	domestic	counterespionage	.
One	learns	a	lot	*ICH*-1	from	this	book	,	or	seems	*-2	to	*?*	,	about	crippling	federal	bureaucracy	.
``	*	Seems	*-1	to	*?*	''	because	it	*EXP*-2	's	possible	that	the	CIA	and	the	National	Security	Agency	were	more	interested	than	they	let	on	to	Mr.	Stoll	.
Finally	,	he	got	help	.
Tymnet	is	a	major	network	linking	computers	.
One	of	its	international	specialists	,	Steve	White	,	took	a	quick	interest	in	Mr.	Stoll	's	hunt	,	*-1	ultimately	tracing	the	hacker	to	West	Germany	.
The	West	Germans	then	took	over	and	finally	found	Markus	Hess	.
Eventually	,	Mr.	Stoll	was	invited	*-101	to	both	the	CIA	and	NSA	*-1	to	brief	high-ranking	officers	on	computer	theft	.
He	savored	the	humor	of	his	uncombed	appearance	among	these	buttoned-up	chaps	.
*-1	Back	in	Berkeley	,	he	was	violently	scolded	*-1	by	a	left-wing	lady	friend	for	*-2	consorting	with	such	people	.
He	became	angry	in	return	.
He	had	developed	a	hatred	for	the	hacker	and	a	grudging	appreciation	of	the	federal	``	spooks	''	who	*T*-135	make	national	security	their	business	.
At	several	different	levels	,	it	's	a	fascinating	tale	.

Mips	Computer	Systems	Inc.	today	will	unveil	a	new	general-purpose	computer	that	*T*-136	will	compete	with	more	expensive	machines	from	companies	such	as	Sun	Microsystems	Inc.	and	Digital	Equipment	Corp	.
The	closely	held	Sunnyvale	,	Calif.	,	company	also	will	announce	an	agreement	*	to	supply	computers	to	Control	Data	Corp.	,	which	*T*-137	will	sell	Mips	machines	under	its	own	label	.
The	new	Mips	machine	,	called	*	the	RC6280	,	will	cost	$	150,000	*U*	for	a	basic	system	.
The	computer	processes	55	million	instructions	per	second	and	uses	only	one	central	processing	chip	,	unlike	many	rival	machines	using	several	processors	.
The	machine	employs	reduced	instruction-set	computing	,	or	RISC	,	technology	.
At	that	price	,	an	analyst	familiar	with	the	machine	said	0	*T*-1	,	the	computer	offers	up	to	10	times	the	performance	of	similar	machines	.
``	In	the	price	range	it	's	a	tremendously	high-performing	product	,	''	said	*T*-1	Sandy	Gant	,	an	analyst	at	the	market-research	firm	InfoCorp	.
The	machine	is	part	of	an	effort	*ICH*-1	by	Mips	*	to	establish	itself	as	a	supplier	of	computers	,	not	just	of	integrated-circuit	technology	.
Mips	also	wants	*-1	to	wedge	into	markets	other	than	traditional	RISC	applications	such	as	engineering	;	Mips	said	0	the	new	machine	will	also	be	used	*-102	by	businesses	and	for	communications	.
``	This	clearly	demonstrates	that	Mips	is	a	systems	company	rather	than	just	a	chip	company	,	''	said	*T*-1	Mips	Vice	President	John	Hime	.
The	Control	Data	deal	is	a	boon	for	Mips	because	it	gives	the	the	five-year-old	company	one	more	ally	as	it	battles	more	established	electronic	concerns	such	as	Sun	,	Hewlett-Packard	Co.	,	Motorola	Inc.	and	Intel	Corp.	for	the	emerging	market	for	RISC	machines	.
RISC	technology	speeds	up	a	computer	by	*-1	simplifying	the	internal	software	.
For	Mips	,	which	*T*-138	expects	revenue	of	$	100	million	*U*	this	year	,	big-name	allies	such	as	Control	Data	are	essential	*	to	attract	software	developers	to	the	company	's	RISC	architecture	.
``	The	thing	0	it	says	*T*-1	about	Mips	is	that	they	're	on	a	roll	right	now	,	''	said	*T*-2	Ms.	Gant	at	InfoCorp	.
``	They	're	getting	some	major	wins	,	''	she	added	*T*-1	.
Last	month	,	for	example	,	Mips	agreed	*-1	to	supply	its	computers	to	Nixdorf	Computer	AG	of	West	Germany	and	France	's	Groupe	Bull	.
Sony	Corp.	,	Tandem	Computers	Inc.	and	Digital	Equipment	have	agreed	*-1	to	sell	MIPS	computers	and	companies	such	as	Japan	's	NEC	Corp.	and	West	Germany	's	Siemens	A.G.	have	agreed	*-2	to	make	Mips	chips	under	license	.
Today	's	agreement	gives	Control	Data	a	machine	0	*T*-1	to	compete	against	Digital	and	other	general-purpose	computer	makers	,	said	0	*T*-2	John	Logan	,	a	computer-market	analyst	at	Aberdeen	Group	Inc.	of	Boston	.
The	machine	is	essentially	a	mainframe	computer	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
``	Suddenly	CDC	-LRB-	Control	Data	-RRB-	has	a	competitive	product	0	*T*-2	to	fight	back	against	the	VAX9000	,	''	a	machine	0	Digital	announced	last	month	*T*-3	,	he	added	0	*T*-1	.
Control	Data	,	based	*	in	Minneapolis	,	Minn.	,	expects	its	sales	of	Mips	systems	,	including	the	new	RC6280	,	to	amount	to	more	than	$	100	million	*U*	by	the	end	of	1991	,	Mips	said	0	*T*-2	.
Nixdorf	,	Bull	and	others	will	also	sell	versions	of	the	machine	,	said	0	*T*-1	Mips	President	Robert	Miller	.
Mips	will	start	*-2	shipping	its	new	machine	in	the	first	quarter	of	1990	,	he	said	*T*-1	.
The	machine	uses	a	single	processor	,	which	*T*-139	makes	it	easier	0	*	to	program	*T*-1	than	competing	machines	using	several	processors	.
The	computer	can	process	13.3	million	calculations	called	*	floating-point	operations	every	second	.
The	machine	can	run	software	written	*	for	other	Mips	computers	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-1	.
Another	fight	is	brewing	between	Congress	and	the	Bush	administration	over	how	*	to	pay	for	the	savings-and-loan	bailout	without	*-2	adding	to	the	federal	budget	deficit	*T*-1	.
In	a	hearing	before	the	House	Ways	and	Means	Committee	,	the	General	Accounting	Office	and	the	Congressional	Budget	Office	,	which	*T*-1	both	are	arms	of	Congress	,	advised	the	new	S&L	bailout	agency	*-3	to	abandon	plans	*	to	raise	temporary	working	capital	through	debt	issued	*	from	an	agency	that	*T*-2	would	n't	be	counted	*-103	on	the	federal	budget	.
Officials	of	the	Resolution	Trust	Corp.	have	said	privately	that	such	a	plan	was	the	most	likely	alternative	*	to	raise	short-term	cash	for	the	bailout	.
Instead	,	the	GAO	and	the	Congressional	Budget	Office	said	0	*T*-1	,	the	RTC	should	consider	*-2	using	Treasury	debt	,	which	*T*-140	is	less	expensive	and	subject	to	oversight	by	Congress	.
The	spending	could	be	exempted	*-1	from	*-2	meeting	deficit-reduction	targets	in	the	Gramm-Rudman	budget	law	.
The	RTC	has	projected	that	it	will	require	between	$	50	billion	to	$	100	billion	*U*	in	temporary	working	capital	.
The	borrowing	0	*T*-1	to	raise	these	funds	would	be	paid	*-104	off	as	assets	of	sick	thrifts	are	sold	*-105	.
The	new	S&L	law	allows	the	RTC	to	issue	notes	for	as	much	as	85	%	of	the	value	of	the	assets	0	it	holds	*T*-1	.
But	higher	interest	rates	paid	*	on	off-budget	debt	could	add	billions	to	the	bailout	costs	,	and	would	n't	be	subject	to	congressional	scrutiny	,	Ways	and	Means	members	argued	0	*T*-2	.
``	*	To	allow	this	massive	level	of	unfettered	federal	borrowing	without	prior	congressional	approval	would	be	irresponsible	,	''	said	*T*-2	Rep.	Fortney	Stark	-LRB-	D.	,	Calif.	-RRB-	,	who	*T*-141	has	introduced	a	bill	0	*T*-1	to	limit	the	RTC	's	authority	*	to	issue	debt	.
The	RTC	will	have	*-1	to	sell	or	merge	hundreds	of	insolvent	thrifts	over	the	next	three	years	.
The	new	S&L	bailout	law	allows	$	50	billion	*U*	to	be	spent	*-1	*	to	sell	or	merge	sick	S&Ls	and	their	assets	,	but	that	is	a	net	cost	.
In	the	meantime	,	the	agency	must	raise	cash	*-1	to	maintain	assets	,	such	as	real	estate	,	until	they	can	be	sold	*-106	.
Then	the	short-term	debt	is	paid	*-107	off	through	the	proceeds	of	*	selling	the	assets	.
David	Mullins	,	assistant	secretary	of	the	Treasury	,	said	that	the	working	capital	is	necessary	*	to	reduce	the	final	costs	of	the	bailout	,	by	*-1	allowing	the	agency	to	sell	savings	and	loans	without	their	bad	assets	,	then	hold	the	assets	until	they	can	be	sold	*-108	under	favorable	conditions	.
He	said	0	it	*ICH*-3	has	n't	yet	been	determined	*-109	how	the	RTC	will	raise	the	cash	*T*-1	,	but	the	administration	does	n't	want	it	to	be	included	*-2	on	the	federal	budget	,	because	it	would	``	distort	''	the	budget	process	by	*-4	requiring	either	exemptions	from	Gramm-Rudman	or	big	increases	in	the	budget	deficit	.
But	the	worst	possibility	would	be	*	raising	no	working	capital	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
``	If	working	capital	financing	is	not	provided	*-3	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	,	``	the	RTC	may	have	*-2	to	slow	-LCB-	S&L	sales	-RCB-	or	dump	acquired	assets	through	fire	sales	.
Panhandle	Eastern	Corp.	said	0	it	applied	,	on	behalf	of	two	of	its	subsidiaries	,	to	the	Federal	Energy	Regulatory	Commission	for	permission	*	to	build	a	352-mile	,	$	273	million	*U*	pipeline	system	from	Pittsburg	County	,	Okla.	,	to	Independence	,	Miss	.
The	natural	gas	pipeline	concern	said	0	the	500	million	cubic	feet	a	day	capacity	pipeline	would	be	built	*-111	by	a	proposed	joint	venture	between	two	Panhandle	Eastern	units	-	Texas	Eastern	Transmission	Corp.	and	Trunkline	Gas	Co	.
Texas	Eastern	Transmission	will	build	and	operate	the	system	,	which	*T*-142	will	connect	the	Arkoma	Basin	with	several	interstate	pipelines	.
Now	was	that	a	quarter	cup	or	a	half	cup	?
Not	a	gripping	question	,	unless	you	're	the	pastry	chef	of	this	city	's	Chez	Panisse	restaurant	and	you	've	just	lost	your	priceless	personal	dessert	notebook	.
Chez	Panisse	was	listed	*-112	among	the	top	30	restaurants	in	the	world	this	year	by	Connoisseur	magazine	.
The	tattered	black	binder	,	bulging	with	18	years	'	worth	of	recipes	held	*	together	by	rubber	bands	,	was	in	chef	Lindsey	Shere	's	purse	when	it	was	stolen	*-113	from	her	house	recently	*T*-2	.
The	Berkeley	police	do	n't	have	any	leads	but	doubt	0	the	crime	was	driven	*-114	by	a	passion	for	sweets	.
Instead	,	they	figure	0	the	culprit	probably	took	money	from	Ms.	Shere	's	wallet	and	discarded	all	the	tips	in	the	five-by-eight-inch	looseleaf	.
Chez	Panisse	,	whose	founder	,	Alice	Waters	,	*T*-3	is	considered	*-115	the	inventor	of	the	cooking	style	known	*	as	California	cuisine	and	whose	patrons	*T*-143	make	reservations	a	month	in	advance	,	has	n't	exactly	subjected	diners	to	vanilla	ice	cream	because	of	the	theft	.
For	one	thing	,	Ms.	Shere	can	draw	on	her	cookbook	,	published	*	by	Random	House	four	years	ago	,	which	*T*-144	is	teeming	with	recipes	for	such	specialties	as	kiwi	sherbet	,	gooseberry	fool	-LRB-	a	creamy	dish	made	*	with	crushed	stewed	berries	-RRB-	and	hazelnut	``	oeufs	a	la	neige	.	''
For	another	,	sympathetic	fans	have	sent	Ms.	Shere	copies	of	her	recipes	clipped	*	from	magazines	over	the	years	.
Still	,	the	restaurant	's	ever-changing	menu	of	five-course	dinners	--	it	supposedly	has	n't	repeated	a	meal	since	*-1	opening	in	1971	--	requires	constant	improvisation	.
And	that	puts	added	pressure	on	Chez	Panisse	dessert-menu	planners	.
``	We	make	what	we	know	how	*	to	make	*T*-1	*T*-2	,	''	says	*T*-3	business	manager	Richard	Mazzera	.
Many	in	the	Bay	Area	's	pastry	community	express	disbelief	that	Ms.	Shere	kept	only	one	copy	of	such	valuable	notes	,	but	she	has	received	moral	support	from	Baker	's	Dozen	,	a	group	of	California	pastry	chefs	that	*T*-145	meets	regularly	*-3	to	discuss	issues	like	how	*	to	keep	meringues	from	weeping	*T*-1	and	how	bovine	eating	habits	affect	butter	texture	*T*-2	.
Ms.	Shere	has	offered	a	$	500	*U*	reward	for	the	book	's	return	but	figures	0	she	'll	have	*-1	to	reinvent	many	recipes	from	scratch	.
``	It	's	an	overwhelming	job	,	''	she	says	*T*-1	.
``	There	are	so	many	possible	proportions	when	you	consider	how	many	things	*T*-1	are	made	*-116	out	of	eggs	and	butter	and	milk	*T*-2	.
Newport	Electronics	Inc.	named	a	new	slate	of	officers	,	a	move	that	*T*-146	follows	replacement	of	the	company	's	five	incumbent	directors	last	week	.
Milton	B.	Hollander	,	60	years	old	,	was	named	*-117	chief	executive	officer	,	*-117	succeeding	Barrett	B.	Weekes	.
Mr.	Hollander	's	Stamford	,	Conn.-based	High	Technology	Holding	Co.	acquired	most	of	its	49.4	%	stake	in	Newport	in	August	.
Mr.	Hollander	was	named	*-118	chairman	last	week	,	*-118	succeeding	Mr.	Weekes	,	who	*T*-147	was	among	the	ousted	directors	.
The	company	has	declined	requests	*	to	discuss	the	changes	,	but	Mr.	Weekes	has	said	that	Mr.	Hollander	wanted	*-1	to	have	his	own	team	.
Scott	Wakeman	was	named	*-119	president	and	chief	operating	officer	of	U.S.	operations	,	titles	that	*T*-1	had	been	held	*-120	by	Mr.	Weekes	.
Mr.	Wakeman	was	vice	president	of	the	instrument	and	controls	division	of	closely	held	Omega	Engineering	Inc.	,	another	company	controlled	*	by	Mr.	Hollander	.
A	company	spokesman	did	n't	know	Mr.	Wakeman	's	age	.
James	R.	Lees	,	51	,	vice	president	of	Newport	's	European	operations	,	was	named	*-121	executive	vice	president	and	chief	operating	officer	of	European	operations	,	*-121	assuming	some	former	duties	of	Mr.	Weekes	.
Arthur	B.	Crozier	,	34	,	an	attorney	,	was	named	*-122	secretary	,	*-122	succeeding	John	Virtue	,	who	*T*-148	was	another	of	the	ousted	directors	.
UNIFIRST	Corp.	declared	a	2-for-1	stock	split	.
The	Wilmington	,	Mass.	,	garment	service	company	also	boosted	its	quarterly	dividend	20	%	to	three	cents	a	share	adjusted	*	for	the	split	.
The	dividend	had	been	five	cents	a	share	.
The	split	and	quarterly	dividend	will	be	payable	Jan.	3	to	stock	of	record	Nov.	16	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	split	will	raise	the	number	of	shares	outstanding	to	about	10.2	million	.
Separately	,	UniFirst	reported	that	net	income	rose	21	%	to	$	3	million	*U*	,	or	29	cents	a	share	adjusted	*	for	the	split	,	for	the	fourth	quarter	ended	*	Aug.	26	.
A	year	earlier	UniFirst	earned	$	2.4	million	*U*	,	or	24	cents	a	share	adjusted	*	for	the	split	.
Sales	rose	to	$	52.4	million	*U*	from	$	50.1	million	*U*	.
Fibreboard	Corp.	said	0	it	completed	the	previously	reported	sale	of	approximately	27,500	acres	of	timberland	near	Truckee	,	Calif.	,	to	closely	held	Sierra	Pacific	Industries	Corp.	,	Arcata	,	Calif.	,	for	$	32.5	million	*U*	.
The	lumber	,	insulation	and	fireproofing	concern	said	0	the	transaction	,	which	*T*-149	includes	a	swap	of	other	timber	interests	,	would	result	in	a	$	13.5	million	*U*	after-tax	gain	,	0	*T*-1	to	be	recorded	*-123	in	the	fourth	quarter	.
Healthcare	International	Inc.	said	0	it	reached	a	120-day	standstill	agreement	*ICH*-1	with	its	HealthVest	affiliate	calling	for	Healthcare	to	pay	HealthVest	$	5	million	*U*	right	away	and	additional	amounts	in	the	future	.
Under	the	agreement	,	Healthcare	,	a	manager	of	health-care	facilities	,	said	0	it	would	pay	HealthVest	$	3.9	million	*U*	in	overdue	rent	and	mortgage	payments	and	repay	$	1.1	million	*U*	in	funds	that	HealthVest	advanced	*T*-150	for	construction	work	on	facilities	.
In	return	,	HealthVest	agreed	that	it	wo	n't	exercise	its	rights	and	remedies	against	Healthcare	during	the	120-day	period	.
After	the	payment	,	Healthcare	still	will	be	$	6.5	million	*U*	in	arrears	on	rent	and	mortgage	payments	to	HealthVest	,	a	real	estate	investment	trust	whose	portfolio	*T*-151	consists	largely	of	properties	operated	*	by	Healthcare	.
Healthcare	has	given	HealthVest	a	12	%	note	for	that	overdue	amount	,	0	*T*-1	to	be	repaid	*-2	over	three	years	.
In	addition	,	Healthcare	agreed	*-4	to	make	monthly	rent	and	mortgage	payments	of	$	2.7	million	to	$	3	million	*U*	to	HealthVest	*ICH*-2	during	the	standstill	period	,	0	*T*-3	to	be	paid	*-125	when	Healthcare	successfully	completes	asset	sales	*T*-1	.
Because	Healthcare	actually	owes	HealthVest	$	4.2	million	*U*	in	rent	and	mortgage	payments	each	month	,	the	amount	due	above	the	amount	paid	*	will	be	added	*-126	to	the	three-year	note	.
The	funds	should	help	*-1	ease	a	cash	bind	at	HealthVest	,	which	*T*-152	has	been	unable	*-2	to	pay	its	debts	because	Healthcare	has	n't	made	complete	rent	and	mortgage	payments	since	July	.
A	spokesman	said	0	HealthVest	has	paid	two	of	the	three	banks	0	it	owed	interest	to	*T*-1	in	October	and	is	in	negotiations	with	the	third	bank	.
Healthcare	,	which	*T*-153	has	been	in	a	severe	liquidity	bind	,	said	0	it	is	able	*-3	to	make	the	payments	because	it	completed	a	transaction	with	Greenery	Rehabilitation	Group	Inc.	in	which	Greenery	purchased	stock	and	warrants	for	$	500,000	*U*	and	loaned	Healthcare	$	9	million	*U*	*T*-2	.
The	loan	is	backed	*-127	by	Healthcare	's	5.4	%	stake	in	HealthVest	and	interest	in	certain	facilities	.
I	was	pleased	*-1	to	note	that	your	Oct.	23	Centennial	Journal	item	recognized	the	money-fund	concept	as	one	of	the	significant	events	of	the	past	century	.
Actually	,	about	two	years	ago	,	the	Journal	listed	the	creation	of	the	money	fund	as	one	of	the	10	most	significant	events	in	the	world	of	finance	in	the	20th	century	.
But	the	Reserve	Fund	,	America	's	first	money	fund	,	was	not	named	*-1	,	nor	were	the	creators	of	the	money-fund	concept	,	Harry	Brown	and	myself	*?*	.
We	innovated	telephone	redemptions	,	daily	dividends	,	total	elimination	of	share	certificates	and	the	constant	$	1	*U*	pershare	pricing	,	all	of	which	*T*-154	were	painfully	thought	*-1	out	and	not	the	result	of	some	inadvertence	on	the	part	of	the	SEC	.
President
The	Reserve	Fund
The	crowning	moment	in	the	career	of	Joseph	F.	O'Kicki	came	as	300	local	and	state	dignitaries	packed	into	his	elegant	,	marble-columned	courtroom	here	last	year	for	his	swearing	in	as	President	Judge	of	Cambria	County	.
Baskets	of	roses	and	potted	palms	adorned	his	bench	.
The	local	American	Legion	color	guard	led	the	way	.
As	the	judge	marched	down	the	center	aisle	in	his	flowing	black	robe	,	he	was	heralded	*-128	by	a	trumpet	fanfare	.
To	many	,	it	was	a	ceremony	more	*ICH*-1	befitting	a	king	than	a	rural	judge	seated	*	in	the	isolated	foothills	of	the	southern	Allegheny	Mountains	.
But	then	Judge	O'Kicki	often	behaved	like	a	man	who	*T*-155	would	be	king	--	and	,	some	say	,	an	arrogant	and	abusive	one	.
While	his	case	may	be	extreme	,	it	reflects	the	vulnerability	of	many	small	communities	to	domineering	judges	.
Last	March	,	nine	months	after	the	judge	's	swearing-in	,	the	state	attorney	general	's	office	indicted	him	on	a	sweeping	array	of	charges	alleging	more	than	10	years	of	``	official	oppression	''	in	Cambria	County	,	a	depressed	steel	and	mining	community	in	western	Pennsylvania	.
The	allegations	,	*-1	ranging	from	theft	and	bribery	to	coercion	and	lewdness	,	paint	a	disquieting	picture	.
According	to	testimony	in	a	public	,	80-page	grand-jury	report	handed	*	up	to	the	state	attorney	general	,	Judge	O'Kicki	extorted	cash	from	lawyers	,	muscled	favorable	loans	from	banks	and	bullied	local	businesses	for	more	than	a	decade	.
Prosecutors	,	in	an	indictment	based	on	the	grand	jury	's	report	,	maintain	that	at	various	times	since	1975	,	he	owned	a	secret	and	illegal	interest	in	a	beer	distributorship	;	plotted	hidden	ownership	interests	in	real	estate	that	*T*-156	presented	an	alleged	conflict	of	interest	;	set	up	a	dummy	corporation	0	*T*-3	to	buy	a	car	and	obtain	insurance	for	his	former	girlfriend	-LRB-	now	his	second	wife	-RRB-	;	and	maintained	54	accounts	in	six	banks	in	Cambria	County	.
In	testimony	recorded	*	in	the	grand	jury	report	,	court	employees	said	0	the	judge	,	now	59	years	old	,	harassed	his	secretaries	,	made	imperial	demands	on	his	staff	and	hounded	anyone	who	*T*-157	crossed	him	.
Bailiffs	claimed	0	they	were	required	*-1	to	chauffeur	him	to	and	from	work	,	mow	his	lawn	,	chop	his	wood	,	fix	his	car	and	even	drop	by	his	house	*-2	to	feed	his	two	grown	mutts	,	Dixie	and	Husky	.
One	former	bailiff	charged	that	the	judge	double-crossed	him	by	*-1	reneging	on	a	promise	of	a	better	paying	job	after	*-2	pocketing	a	$	500	*U*	bribe	.
Some	of	the	allegations	are	simply	bizarre	.
Two	former	secretaries	told	the	grand	jury	0	they	were	summoned	*-129	to	the	judge	's	chambers	on	separate	occasions	*-129	to	take	dictation	,	*-129	only	to	find	the	judge	in	his	bikini	underwear	.
One	secretary	testified	that	the	judge	once	called	her	to	his	office	while	*-1	wearing	nothing	at	all	.
The	judge	,	*-2	suspended	*-3	from	his	bench	pending	his	trial	,	which	*T*-158	began	this	week	,	vehemently	denies	all	the	allegations	against	him	,	*-2	calling	them	``	ludicrous	''	and	``	imaginative	,	political	demagoguery	.	''
He	blames	the	indictment	on	local	political	feuding	,	unhappiness	with	his	aggressive	efforts	*	to	clear	the	courthouse	's	docket	and	a	vendetta	by	state	investigators	and	prosecutors	angered	*	by	some	of	his	rulings	against	them	.
``	I	do	n't	know	whose	toes	I	've	stepped	on	*T*-1	,	''	says	*T*-2	the	judge	.
``	I	'll	find	out	,	eventually	,	who	*T*-159	pushed	the	state	police	buttons	into	action	.	''
Even	if	only	some	of	the	allegations	stand	up	,	however	,	they	provide	ample	testimony	to	the	awesome	power	of	judges	in	rural	communities	.
That	power	can	sometimes	be	abused	*-1	,	particularly	since	jurists	in	smaller	jurisdictions	operate	without	many	of	the	restraints	that	*T*-160	serve	as	corrective	measures	in	urban	areas	.
Lawyers	and	their	clients	who	*T*-161	frequently	bring	business	to	a	country	courthouse	can	expect	*-1	to	appear	before	the	same	judge	year	after	year	.
Fear	of	*	alienating	that	judge	is	pervasive	,	says	0	*T*-1	Maurice	Geiger	,	founder	and	director	of	the	Rural	Justice	Center	in	Montpelier	,	Vt.	,	a	public	interest	group	that	*T*-162	researches	rural	justice	issues	.
As	a	result	,	says	0	*T*-2	Mr.	Geiger	,	lawyers	think	twice	before	*-3	appealing	a	judge	's	ruling	,	are	reluctant	*-3	to	mount	*RNR*-1	,	or	even	support	*RNR*-1	,	challenges	against	him	for	re-election	and	are	usually	loath	*-3	to	file	complaints	that	*T*-163	might	impugn	a	judge	's	integrity	.
Judge	O'Kicki	,	a	stern	and	forbidding-looking	man	,	has	been	a	fixture	in	the	local	legal	community	for	more	than	two	decades	.
*-1	The	son	of	an	immigrant	stonemason	of	Slovenian	descent	,	he	was	raised	*-1	in	a	small	borough	outside	Ebensburg	,	the	Cambria	County	seat	,	and	put	himself	through	the	University	of	Pittsburgh	Law	School	.
He	graduated	near	the	top	of	his	class	,	*-2	serving	on	the	school	law	review	with	Richard	Thornburgh	,	who	*T*-164	went	on	*-1	to	become	governor	of	Pennsylvania	and	,	now	,	U.S.	Attorney	General	.
It	was	also	in	law	school	that	Mr.	O'Kicki	and	his	first	wife	had	the	first	of	seven	daughters	*T*-1	.
He	divorced	his	first	wife	three	years	ago	and	married	the	daughter	of	his	court	clerk	.
Last	year	,	Pennsylvania	Supreme	Court	Justice	John	P.	Flaherty	called	Mr.	O'Kicki	one	of	the	finest	judges	``	not	only	in	Pennsylvania	but	in	the	United	States	.	''
Clearly	,	the	judge	has	had	his	share	of	accomplishments	.
After	*-1	practicing	law	locally	,	he	was	elected	*-1	to	his	first	10-year	term	as	judge	in	1971	;	in	1981	,	he	was	effectively	re-elected	*-2	.
Six	years	ago	,	Judge	O'Kicki	was	voted	*-131	president	of	the	Pennsylvania	Conference	of	State	Trial	Judges	by	the	state	's	400	judges	.
He	has	been	considered	*-132	several	times	for	appointments	to	federal	district	and	appellate	court	vacancies	in	Pennsylvania	.
And	when	he	ran	unsuccessfully	for	a	state	appellate	court	seat	in	1983	*T*-1	,	the	Pennsylvania	Bar	Association	rated	him	``	one	of	the	best	available	,	''	after	*-2	interviewing	local	lawyers	.
``	He	probably	was	the	smartest	guy	who	*T*-165	ever	sat	on	our	bench	,	''	says	*T*-1	a	former	president	of	Cambria	County	's	150-member	bar	association	,	who	*T*-166	,	like	most	lawyers	in	Cambria	County	,	refuses	*-3	to	talk	about	the	judge	*PPA*-2	publicly	.
``	He	's	sharp	as	a	tack	.
He	could	grasp	an	issue	with	the	blink	of	an	eye	.	''
For	more	than	a	decade	,	virtually	no	one	complained	about	Judge	O'Kicki	.
``	What	about	those	institutions	that	*T*-167	are	supposed	*-2	to	be	the	bedrock	of	society	,	the	banks	and	the	bar	association	...	?	''	wrote	*T*-1	a	columnist	for	the	Tribune-Democrat	,	a	newspaper	in	nearby	Johnstown	,	shortly	after	the	scandal	became	public	.
``	If	only	a	banker	or	a	lawyer	had	spoken	out	years	ago	,	the	judicial	process	would	n't	be	under	the	taint	0	it	is	*T*-1	today	.	''
Officials	with	the	Pennsylvania	Judicial	Inquiry	and	Review	Board	,	the	arm	of	the	state	that	*T*-168	investigates	judicial	misconduct	,	counter	that	they	had	no	inkling	of	anything	amiss	in	Ebensburg	.
``	Nobody	told	us	;	nobody	called	us	,	''	says	*T*-1	an	official	close	to	the	case	who	*T*-169	asked	*-2	not	to	be	named	*-133	.
``	Nobody	had	the	guts	0	*	to	complain	*T*-1	.	''
Certainly	not	the	lawyers	.
Johnstown	attorney	Richard	J.	Green	Jr.	shelled	out	$	500	*U*	in	loans	to	the	judge	over	five	years	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	in	testimony	to	the	grand	jury	.
``	The	judge	never	made	a	pretense	of	*	repaying	the	money	,	''	said	*T*-1	Mr.	Green	.
Eventually	,	Mr.	Green	testified	0	*T*-1	,	he	began	*-3	ducking	out	of	his	office	rather	than	face	the	judge	when	he	visited	*T*-2	.
When	Mr.	Green	won	a	$	240,000	*U*	verdict	in	a	land	condemnation	case	against	the	state	*T*-1	in	June	1983	,	he	says	0	Judge	O'Kicki	unexpectedly	awarded	him	an	additional	$	100,000	*U*	.
Mr.	Green	thought	little	of	it	,	he	told	the	grand	jury	0	*T*-1	,	until	the	judge	walked	up	to	him	after	the	courtroom	had	cleared	and	suggested	a	kickback	.
``	Do	n't	you	think	0	I	ought	*-2	to	get	a	commission	...	or	part	of	your	fee	in	this	case	?	''	Mr.	Green	said	0	the	judge	asked	him	*T*-1	.
*-2	Appalled	,	Mr.	Green	never	paid	the	money	,	he	testified	0	*T*-1	.
But	he	did	n't	complain	to	the	state	's	Judicial	Inquiry	and	Review	Board	,	either	,	*-1	saying	later	that	he	feared	retribution	.
Mr.	O'Kicki	said	0	he	will	respond	to	Mr.	Green	's	allegation	at	his	trial	.
Like	most	of	Cambria	County	's	lawyers	and	residents	who	*T*-170	had	dealings	with	the	judge	,	Mr.	Green	declined	*-1	to	be	interviewed	*-134	for	this	article	.
And	no	one	with	a	complaint	about	the	judge	would	allow	his	name	to	be	printed	*-1	.
``	I	do	n't	have	anything	much	0	*	to	say	*T*-5	,	and	I	think	0	that	's	what	you	're	going	*-3	to	find	from	everyone	else	0	you	talk	to	*T*-4	up	here	,	''	says	*T*-1	local	attorney	Edward	F.	Peduzzi	.
Says	*ICH*-1	another	lawyer	:	``	The	practice	of	law	is	a	matter	of	*	biting	one	's	lip	when	you	live	in	a	small	community	*T*-2	.
One	had	best	*-1	not	dance	on	top	of	a	coffin	until	the	lid	is	sealed	*-2	tightly	shut	.	''
The	judge	was	considered	*-137	imperious	,	abrasive	and	ambitious	,	those	who	*T*-171	practiced	before	him	say	0	*T*-1	.
He	sipped	tea	sweetened	with	honey	from	his	high-backed	leather	chair	at	his	bench	,	while	*-1	scribbling	notes	ordering	spectators	to	stop	whispering	or	to	take	off	their	hats	in	his	courtroom	.
Four	years	ago	,	he	jailed	all	nine	members	of	the	Cambria	County	School	Board	for	several	hours	after	they	defied	his	order	*	to	extend	the	school	year	by	several	weeks	*-2	to	make	up	for	time	lost	*	during	a	teachers	'	strike	.
Visitors	in	his	chambers	say	0	he	could	cite	precisely	the	years	,	months	,	weeks	and	days	remaining	until	mandatory	retirement	would	force	aside	the	presiding	president	judge	,	*	giving	Judge	O'Kicki	the	seniority	required	*	to	take	over	as	the	county	's	top	court	administrator	.
The	judge	,	they	say	0	*T*-1	,	was	fiercely	proud	of	his	abilities	and	accomplishments	.
``	My	name	is	judge	,	''	Judge	O'Kicki	told	a	car	salesman	in	Ebensburg	*T*-2	when	he	bought	a	new	red	Pontiac	Sunbird	in	October	1984	*T*-1	,	according	to	the	grand-jury	report	.
The	dealership	dutifully	recorded	the	sale	under	the	name	``	Judge	O'Kicki	.	''
Yet	,	despite	the	judge	's	imperial	bearing	,	no	one	ever	had	reason	0	*	to	suspect	possible	wrongdoing	*T*-2	,	says	0	*T*-1	John	Bognato	,	president	of	Cambria	County	's	150-member	bar	association	.
``	The	arrogance	of	a	judge	,	his	demeanor	,	the	way	0	he	handles	people	*T*-1	are	not	a	basis	for	*	filing	a	complaint	,	''	says	*T*-2	Mr.	Bognato	.
``	Until	this	came	up	and	hit	the	press	,	there	was	never	any	indication	that	he	was	doing	anything	wrong	.	''
State	investigators	dispute	that	view	now	,	particularly	in	light	of	the	judge	's	various	business	dealings	in	Cambria	County	.
The	judge	came	under	scrutiny	in	late	1987	,	after	the	state	attorney	general	's	office	launched	an	unrelated	investigation	into	corruption	in	Cambria	County	.
The	inquiry	soon	focused	on	the	judge	.
Even	his	routine	business	transactions	caused	trouble	,	according	to	the	grand	jury	report	.
When	the	judge	bought	his	new	Sunbird	from	James	E.	Black	Pontiac-Cadillac	in	Ebensburg	five	years	ago	*T*-1	,	the	dealership	had	``	certain	apprehensions	''	about	the	judge	's	reputation	,	according	to	the	grand-jury	report	.
The	dealership	took	the	extra	step	of	*	having	all	the	paper	work	for	the	transaction	pre-approved	*-2	by	Ebensburg	's	local	lender	,	Laurel	Bank	.
Then	,	as	an	additional	precaution	,	the	car	dealership	took	the	judge	's	photograph	*ICH*-1	as	he	stood	next	to	his	new	car	with	sales	papers	in	hand	--	proof	that	he	had	received	the	loan	documents	.
But	when	the	judge	received	his	payment	book	*T*-1	,	he	disavowed	the	deal	.
``	There	was	no	loan	,	there	is	no	loan	,	there	never	shall	be	a	loan	,	''	the	judge	wrote	the	bank	*T*-1	on	his	judicial	stationery	,	according	to	the	report	.
Later	,	the	judge	went	a	step	farther	.
After	Laurel	Bank	tried	*-1	to	repossess	the	car	,	a	vice	president	asked	him	*-2	to	intervene	in	an	unrelated	legal	dispute	involving	a	trust	account	.
The	judge	wrote	again	.
``	I	find	myself	in	an	adversary	relationship	with	Laurel	Bank	,	and	I	am	not	inclined	*-1	to	extend	myself	as	far	as	any	favors	are	concerned	*-138	,	''	the	judge	wrote	back	*T*-3	in	a	letter	attached	*	to	the	grand	jury	's	report	.
``	Perhaps	if	my	personal	matters	can	be	resolved	*-139	with	Laurel	bank	in	the	near	future	,	I	may	be	inclined	*-1	to	reconsider	your	request	...	.	''
The	judge	now	says	0	it	*EXP*-1	was	``	unfortunate	''	that	he	chose	*-2	to	write	the	letter	but	says	``	there	was	certainly	no	intent	*	to	extort	there	.	''
The	bank	acquiesced	.
It	refinanced	the	judge	's	loan	,	lowered	its	interest	rate	and	accepted	a	trade-in	that	*T*-172	had	n't	originally	been	part	of	the	deal	--	a	beat	up	1981	Chevy	Citation	0	the	dealer	had	*-2	to	repair	*T*-1	before	it	could	be	resold	*-140	.
The	incident	was	n't	the	only	time	0	the	judge	got	special	treatment	from	his	local	bank	*T*-1	.
Two	years	later	,	he	wrote	*-2	to	complain	that	the	interest	0	he	was	paying	*T*-1	on	an	unsecured	$	10,000	*U*	loan	was	``	absolutely	onerous	.	''
Paul	L.	Kane	,	Laurel	's	president	at	the	time	,	quickly	responded	.
The	bank	,	he	wrote	back	0	*T*-1	,	was	``	immediately	''	lowering	the	rate	by	3.5	%	,	``	as	a	concession	to	you	.	''
The	judge	says	0	he	ca	n't	discuss	in	detail	how	he	will	defend	himself	at	his	trial	*T*-1	,	although	he	contends	that	if	he	were	as	corrupt	as	state	prosecutors	believe	*?*	,	he	would	be	far	wealthier	than	he	is	*?*	.
His	seven-bedroom	cedar	and	brick	house	outside	of	Johnstown	is	up	for	sale	*-1	to	pay	for	his	lawyers	.
The	judge	says	0	he	is	confident	0	he	will	return	to	his	old	bench	.
Already	,	he	notes	0	*T*-1	,	the	76	charges	originally	filed	against	him	have	been	trimmed	*-141	to	27	.
Most	of	the	allegations	no	longer	pending	were	ethics	charges	withdrawn	*	by	state	prosecutors	as	part	of	a	pre-trial	agreement	.
The	heart	of	the	case	--	``	official	oppression	''	--	remains	intact	.
``	If	I	lose	,	I	lose	my	position	,	my	career	,	my	pension	,	my	home	and	my	investments	,	''	says	*T*-1	the	judge	.
``	My	God	and	I	know	0	I	am	correct	and	innocent	.
Many	thanks	for	Alexander	Cockburn	's	comic	masterpiece	-LRB-	``	U.S.	.	Economy	:	A	House	Built	*	on	Junk-Bond	Sand	,	''	Viewpoint	,	Oct.	19	-RRB-	.
The	use	of	the	abominable	construction	practices	in	the	Soviet	Union	--	as	*	evidenced	*-1	by	the	collapse	of	sand	apartment	blocks	during	the	Armenian	earthquake	--	as	a	metaphor	for	the	U.S.	economic	system	was	a	sublime	example	of	Mr.	Cockburn	's	satirical	muse	.
I	await	his	sequel	:	the	economic	and	social	resiliency	of	the	San	Francisco	Bay	area	and	the	outstanding	work	of	the	local	governments	and	the	private	charitable	organizations	there	as	metaphors	for	the	supremacy	of	whatever	failed	system	Mr.	Cockburn	now	believes	in	*T*-1	.
It	should	be	a	scream	.

Berthold	is	based	*-1	in	Wildbad	,	West	Germany	,	and	also	has	operations	in	Belgium	.
John	M.	Kucharski	,	EG&G	's	chairman	and	chief	executive	,	said	0	the	acquisition	``	will	extend	EG&G	's	core	technologies	,	strengthen	its	position	in	the	European	Economic	Community	and	assure	a	strength	and	presence	in	the	Eastern	European	market	.	''
He	said	0	it	especially	will	strengthen	the	company	's	efforts	in	the	rapidly	growing	field	of	bio-analytical	instrumentation	,	and	in	applied	nuclear	physics	.
Separately	,	EG&G	said	0	it	sold	most	of	its	Mason	Research	Institute	subsidiary	to	Transgenic	Sciences	Inc.	,	a	closely	held	biotechnology	company	based	*	in	Worcester	,	Mass	.
The	sale	,	for	$	7	million	*U*	in	cash	and	securities	,	will	leave	EG&G	with	a	12	%	stake	in	Transgenic	,	executives	said	0	*T*-1	.

Mason	serves	commercial	and	government	customers	,	including	the	National	Institutes	of	Health	.
The	combined	companies	will	become	profitable	by	January	1990	,	said	0	*T*-1	James	P.	Sherblom	,	Transgenic	's	chairman	and	chief	executive	officer	.
The	Internal	Revenue	Service	said	0	it	is	willing	*-2	to	let	the	U.S.	Tax	Court	decide	how	much	oil	man	William	Herbert	Hunt	will	owe	the	government	*T*-1	after	his	assets	are	liquidated	*-164	.
The	surprise	announcement	came	after	the	IRS	broke	off	negotiations	with	Mr.	Hunt	on	a	settlement	of	the	one-time	tycoon	's	personal	bankruptcy	case	.
Although	the	action	removes	one	obstacle	in	the	way	of	an	overall	settlement	to	the	case	,	it	also	means	that	Mr.	Hunt	could	be	stripped	*-165	of	virtually	all	of	his	assets	if	the	Tax	Court	rules	against	him	in	a	1982	case	heard	*	earlier	this	year	in	Washington	,	D.C	.
The	IRS	has	been	seeking	more	than	$	300	million	*U*	in	back	taxes	from	Mr.	Hunt	.
Separately	,	a	federal	judge	hearing	Mr.	Hunt	's	bankruptcy	case	yesterday	turned	down	a	proposed	$	65.7	million	*U*	settlement	between	Mr.	Hunt	and	Minpeco	S.A.	,	another	major	creditor	in	the	case	.
The	Peruvian	minerals	concern	had	been	seeking	a	claim	of	$	251	million	*U*	against	Mr.	Hunt	.
In	addition	to	*-1	turning	down	the	compromise	,	Judge	Harold	C.	Abramson	said	0	he	would	allow	a	claim	of	only	$	19.7	million	*U*	.
Minpeco	attorneys	said	0	they	would	appeal	the	decision	to	a	federal	district	court	.
*	Regarding	Mr.	Hunt	's	taxes	,	he	and	the	IRS	have	apparently	agreed	on	a	basic	formula	for	*	liquidating	his	estate	in	which	the	IRS	would	get	70	%	of	the	proceeds	from	a	liquidating	trust	and	30	%	would	go	to	other	creditors	*T*-1	.
But	they	have	been	at	odds	over	how	much	Mr.	Hunt	would	owe	the	government	*T*-1	after	his	assets	are	sold	*-166	.
The	IRS	had	demanded	$	90	million	*U*	but	Mr.	Hunt	would	agree	to	no	more	than	$	60	million	*U*	.
Grover	Hartt	III	,	a	government	lawyer	,	warned	that	Mr.	Hunt	stood	*-2	to	lose	certain	oil	and	gas	properties	,	$	200,000	*U*	in	English	pottery	,	a	Colorado	condominium	and	other	assets	0	he	might	have	kept	*T*-1	if	he	had	settled	with	the	IRS	.
``	But	they	wanted	*-2	to	roll	the	dice	and	we	're	going	*-3	to	let	them	,	''	Mr.	Hartt	said	*T*-1	.
Stephen	McCartin	,	Mr.	Hunt	's	attorney	,	said	0	his	client	welcomed	the	gamble	.
The	Tax	Court	is	n't	expected	*-1	to	rule	before	early	next	year	.
Japan	has	found	another	safe	outlet	for	its	money	:	U.S.	home	mortgages	.
An	increasing	number	of	big	Japanese	investors	are	buying	up	U.S.	home	mortgages	that	*T*-175	have	been	pooled	*-2	and	packaged	*-2	for	sale	as	interest-bearing	instruments	known	*	as	mortgage-backed	securities	.
As	much	as	10	%	*U*	of	new	U.S.	mortgage	securities	issued	*	by	the	Federal	National	Mortgage	Association	,	or	Fannie	Mae	,	and	Federal	Home	Loan	Mortgage	Corp.	,	or	Freddie	Mac	,	now	flow	into	Japanese	hands	.
That	may	not	come	as	a	surprise	to	Americans	who	*T*-176	have	watched	the	Japanese	snap	up	properties	in	the	U.S.	from	golf	courses	to	a	stake	in	Rockefeller	Center	.
But	it	marks	a	big	change	for	the	Japanese	,	who	*T*-177	shunned	mortgage	securities	after	*-1	getting	burned	*-2	by	a	big	downturn	in	interest	rates	a	few	years	back	.
``	You	ca	n't	say	0	it	's	a	``	tsunami	''	-LRB-	tidal	wave	-RRB-	,	but	we	're	making	some	headway	,	''	says	*T*-1	Fannie	Mae	's	chairman	,	David	O.	Maxwell	,	who	*T*-178	visits	Tokyo	at	least	once	a	year	*-3	to	explain	*RNR*-4	and	drum	up	investor	interest	in	*RNR*-4	mortgage	securities	.
``	Interest	is	a	great	deal	higher	than	it	was	*?*	a	year	ago	.	''
The	steady	growth	of	the	mortgage	securities	market	in	the	U.S.	has	even	triggered	talk	of	*	building	up	a	similar	market	here	.
Evidence	of	the	growing	Japanese	demand	for	mortgage	securities	abounds	.
Earlier	this	year	,	Blackstone	Group	,	a	New	York	investment	bank	,	had	no	trouble	*	selling	out	a	special	$	570	million	*U*	mortgage-securities	trust	0	it	created	*T*-1	for	Japanese	investors	.
Industrial	Bank	of	Japan	,	which	*T*-179	claims	*-2	to	be	the	biggest	Japanese	buyer	of	U.S.	mortgage	securities	,	says	0	it	will	more	than	double	its	purchases	this	year	,	to	an	amount	0	one	official	puts	*T*-1	at	several	billion	dollars	.
And	a	Fannie	Mae	seminar	this	week	promises	*-2	to	draw	hundreds	of	prospective	investors	,	who	*T*-180	can	be	expected	*-1	to	channel	tens	of	billions	of	dollars	into	the	market	in	the	next	few	years	.
``	Last	year	,	there	were	only	several	big	investors	who	*T*-181	were	interested	,	''	says	*T*-1	Kinji	Kato	,	a	vice	president	at	the	international	arm	of	Nomura	Securities	Co	.
``	This	year	,	some	investors	are	changing	their	policies	and	investing	a	lot	.	''
Ultimately	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	,	strong	demand	could	help	*-2	to	drive	down	interest	rates	on	mortgage	securities	.
At	the	moment	,	Nomura	is	the	only	Japanese	institution	authorized	*	to	act	as	a	primary	seller	of	Fannie	Mae	instruments	.
But	other	Japanese	institutions	say	privately	that	they	are	considering	*-1	asking	*-2	to	join	the	59-dealer	selling	group	.
These	securities	are	attractive	to	Japanese	investors	for	three	reasons	.
First	,	they	are	safe	.
While	they	are	n't	backed	*-1	by	the	full	faith	and	credit	of	the	U.S.	government	,	as	Treasury	bonds	are	*?*	,	it	*EXP*-2	is	widely	assumed	that	the	government	would	support	them	if	necessary	.
-LRB-	U.S.	Treasury	bonds	are	still	the	dollar-denominated	investment	of	choice	for	long-term	Japanese	investors	-RRB-	.
Second	,	they	are	liquid	.
The	secondary	market	in	federally	backed	mortgage	securities	now	exceeds	$	900	billion	*U*	,	or	nearly	half	of	the	$	2.2	trillion	*U*	in	U.S.	residential	mortgages	issued	*	.
Third	,	they	offer	high	yields	.
At	the	moment	,	some	offer	as	much	as	1.6	to	1.8	percentage	points	over	Treasury	securities	of	similar	maturities	.
But	there	is	a	risk	,	which	the	Japanese	discovered	*T*-182	when	they	first	dipped	their	toes	into	the	market	nearly	five	years	ago	*T*-1	.
Since	most	mortgages	can	be	prepaid	or	refinanced	*-1	at	any	time	,	issuers	of	mortgage	securities	retain	the	right	*	to	buy	back	their	bonds	before	maturity	.
That	's	a	headache	for	long-term	investors	,	since	it	forces	them	to	reinvest	their	money	--	usually	at	lower	rates	than	the	original	mortgage	securities	carried	*?*	.
``	Two	or	three	years	ago	,	the	problem	was	that	people	did	n't	understand	the	prepayment	risk	,	''	says	*T*-1	Nomura	's	Mr.	Kato	.
``	So	they	were	surprised	and	very	disappointed	by	prepayment	.	''
*	Compounding	the	trouble	to	Japanese	investors	,	mortgage	securities	pay	interest	monthly	,	since	most	mortgages	require	homeowners	to	make	monthly	payments	.
But	Japanese	institutional	investors	are	used	*-167	to	quarterly	or	semiannual	payments	on	their	investments	,	so	the	monthly	cash	flow	posed	administrative	problems	.
As	a	result	,	Japanese	investors	steered	clear	of	the	mortgage	securities	.
But	they	did	n't	lose	touch	with	the	U.S.	issuers	.
Since	1985	,	Japanese	investors	have	bought	nearly	80	%	of	$	10	billion	*U*	in	Fannie	Mae	corporate	debt	issued	*	to	foreigners	,	money	that	Fannie	Mae	uses	*T*-183	*-1	to	buy	mortgages	from	U.S.	banks	.
And	Japanese	investors	took	up	nearly	all	of	two	$	200	million	*U*	Real	Estate	Mortgage	Investment	Conduits	,	a	kind	of	collateralized	mortgage	obligation	,	that	*T*-1	were	offered	*-168	to	foreigners	this	year	.
In	addition	,	further	packaging	of	mortgage-backed	securities	,	such	as	Blackstone	's	fund	,	have	reduced	the	effects	of	prepayment	risk	and	automatically	reinvest	monthly	payments	so	institutions	do	n't	have	*-1	to	*?*	.
Freddie	Mac	for	years	has	offered	a	so-called	participation	certificate	that	*T*-184	guarantees	0	it	wo	n't	be	prepaid	*-169	for	a	set	number	of	years	and	offers	semiannual	payments	.
As	Georgia-Pacific	's	bid	for	Great	Northern	Nekoosa	has	shown	0	*?*	,	uninvited	takeovers	are	still	alive	despite	premature	reports	of	their	demise	.
Therefore	,	the	debate	about	poison	pills	will	continue	*-1	to	rage	in	the	boardrooms	of	corporations	and	the	halls	of	academia	.
Although	poison	pills	come	in	different	colors	and	shapes	,	they	usually	give	current	shareholders	the	right	*	to	buy	more	stock	of	their	corporation	at	a	large	discount	if	certain	events	occur	--	typically	,	if	a	hostile	bidder	acquires	more	than	a	specified	percentage	of	the	corporation	's	stock	.
However	,	these	discount	purchase	rights	may	generally	be	redeemed	*-170	at	a	nominal	cost	by	the	corporation	's	directors	if	they	approve	of	a	bidder	.
Supporters	of	poison	pills	argue	that	their	adoption	forces	bidders	to	negotiate	with	a	corporation	's	directors	,	who	*T*-185	are	thereby	put	*-1	in	a	better	position	0	*	to	pursue	the	long-term	interests	of	the	corporation	*T*-2	.
Recent	studies	by	Georgeson	&	Co.	conclude	that	corporations	with	poison	pills	have	experienced	greater	stock-price	appreciation	than	corporations	without	poison	pills	during	the	past	few	years	.
Critics	of	poison	pills	argue	that	they	harm	shareholders	by	*-1	letting	corporate	management	defeat	takeover	bids	at	premium	prices	and	by	*-1	deterring	premium	bids	from	*-2	ever	being	made	*-171	to	shareholders	.
These	critics	are	backed	*-172	by	several	academic	studies	showing	that	the	adoption	of	poison	pills	reduces	shareholder	values	not	merely	in	the	short	run	,	but	also	over	longer	periods	.
Institutional	investors	that	*T*-186	must	evaluate	poison	pills	on	a	regular	basis	are	interested	less	*ICH*-1	in	this	general	debate	than	in	the	answers	to	specific	questions	about	the	corporation	issuing	the	pill	.
Does	this	corporation	have	a	high-quality	management	team	with	a	good	track	record	?
Does	this	team	have	a	viable	strategy	for	*	improving	shareholder	values	,	and	does	this	strategy	require	implementation	over	an	extended	period	?
Will	the	adoption	of	this	particular	form	of	a	poison	pill	significantly	improve	the	chances	for	management	to	carry	out	this	strategy	?
If	the	answers	to	these	questions	are	affirmative	,	then	institutional	investors	are	likely	*-1	to	be	favorably	disposed	toward	a	specific	poison	pill	.
However	,	the	problem	is	that	once	most	poison	pills	are	adopted	*-173	,	they	survive	forever	.
Although	the	current	management	team	may	be	outstanding	,	who	will	*T*-187	be	the	CEO	in	10	years	?
Although	the	five-year	strategy	may	be	excellent	,	what	will	*T*-188	be	the	strategy	in	25	years	?
The	solution	to	this	problem	is	a	time-limited	poison	pill	.
The	limit	could	range	from	three	years	to	seven	years	,	depending	on	the	composition	of	the	management	team	and	the	nature	of	its	strategic	plan	.
At	the	end	of	this	period	,	the	poison	pill	would	be	eliminated	*-174	automatically	,	unless	a	new	poison	pill	were	approved	*-175	by	the	then-current	shareholders	,	who	*T*-189	would	have	an	opportunity	*	to	evaluate	the	corporation	's	strategy	and	management	team	at	that	time	.
One	rare	example	of	a	time-limited	poison	pill	is	the	shareholder	rights	plan	adopted	*	by	Pennzoil	last	year	after	it	received	a	huge	litigation	settlement	from	Texaco	.
Pennzoil	's	poison	pill	covers	five	years	in	order	*	to	give	current	management	enough	time	0	*	to	put	these	proceeds	to	work	in	a	prudent	manner	*T*-1	.
Another	interesting	example	is	the	poison	pill	adopted	*	recently	by	Pittsburgh-based	National	Intergroup	Inc.	,	a	diversified	holding	company	.
The	State	of	Wisconsin	Investment	Board	,	which	*T*-190	owned	about	7	%	of	the	company	's	voting	stock	,	worked	with	management	*-1	to	devise	a	time-limited	poison	pill	.
This	pill	automatically	expires	after	three	years	unless	*-1	continued	*-2	by	a	vote	of	the	shareholders	.
The	attitude	of	the	Wisconsin	Investment	Board	reflects	a	growing	receptivity	to	time-limited	poison	pills	on	the	part	of	institutional	investors	,	as	*	shown	*-1	by	the	discussions	at	recent	meetings	of	the	Council	of	Institutional	Investors	and	my	informal	survey	of	several	retirement	plans	with	large	stock	positions	.
More	widespread	time	limits	on	poison	pills	would	allow	shareholders	to	evaluate	a	specific	poison	pill	within	the	context	of	a	specific	management	team	's	strategy	.
Such	concrete	analysis	is	likely	*-1	to	lead	to	more	fruitful	dialogue	between	management	and	shareholders	than	the	abstract	debate	about	poison	pills	.
Mr.	Pozen	is	the	general	counsel	and	a	managing	director	of	Fidelity	Investments	in	Boston	.
Michael	Blair	,	former	president	and	chief	executive	officer	of	Enfield	Corp.	,	failed	*-2	to	win	election	to	the	company	's	board	at	a	special	shareholder	meeting	.
Mr.	Blair	said	after	the	meeting	that	he	had	filed	separate	lawsuits	*ICH*-1	*ICH*-2	in	the	Ontario	Supreme	Court	for	unjust	dismissal	against	Enfield	and	for	libel	against	its	largest	shareholder	,	Canadian	Express	Ltd.	,	and	two	executives	of	Hees	International	Bancorp	Inc.	,	which	*T*-191	controls	Canadian	Express	.
Holders	at	the	meeting	elected	a	full	slate	of	Canadian	Express	nominees	to	Enfield	's	11-member	board	.
Mr.	Blair	and	Hees	have	been	feuding	for	months	.
Yesterday	's	election	was	a	sequel	to	Enfield	's	annual	meeting	in	June	when	Mr.	Blair	disallowed	proxies	in	favor	of	two	Hees	nominees	*T*-1	.
The	Ontario	Supreme	Court	overturned	Mr.	Blair	's	decision	.
He	later	resigned	from	his	executive	positions	with	Enfield	,	*-1	saying	that	actions	by	its	board	``	amounted	to	-LCB-	my	-RCB-	dismissal	.	''
Mr.	Blair	said	0	his	libel	suit	seeks	10	million	Canadian	dollars	-LRB-	US$	8.5	million	*U*	-RRB-	from	Canadian	Express	and	Hees	executives	Manfred	Walt	and	Willard	L'Heureux	.
He	said	0	his	suit	against	Enfield	seeks	two	years	severance	pay	,	equivalent	to	C$	720,000	*U*	.

*	Buying	51	%	of	Rockefeller	Group	Inc.	is	right	up	Mitsubishi	Estate	Co.	's	alley	in	one	sense	:	The	huge	Japanese	real	estate	company	is	entering	a	long-term	relationship	with	a	similarly	conservative	U.S.	owner	of	tony	urban	property	.
But	in	another	sense	,	the	$	846	million	*U*	purchase	is	uncharacteristically	nervy	,	industry	analysts	say	0	*T*-1	.
The	usually	cautious	giant	will	become	the	majority	owner	of	the	company	that	*T*-192	owns	New	York	's	beloved	Rockefeller	Center	at	a	time	when	tensions	over	Japanese	purchases	of	U.S.	property	are	at	an	all-time	high	*T*-1	.
Officials	of	Rockefeller	Group	and	Mitsubishi	Estate	prefer	*-1	to	focus	on	the	affinities	,	*-1	nearly	dismissing	the	threat	of	a	backlash	from	the	U.S.	public	.

During	the	past	year	,	government	officials	and	leading	business	organizations	have	repeatedly	urged	Japanese	companies	*-1	to	refrain	from	flashy	real	estate	purchases	in	the
Since	the	mid-1980s	,	Japan	's	other	major	real	estate	purchases	in	the	U.S.	include	Dai-Ichi	Seimei	America	Corp.	's	$	670	million	*U*	purchase	of	an	office	building	at	153	East	53rd	St.	in	Manhattan	in	1987	and	Mitsui	Fudosan	Inc.	's	$	610	million	*U*	purchase	of	the	Exxon	Building	,	part	of	Rockefeller	Center	,	in	1986	.
In	Los	Angeles	,	Arco	Plaza	was	sold	*-179	to	Shuwa	Corp.	for	$	620	million	*U*	in	1986	,	and	Sumitomo	Life	Insurance	Co.	paid	$	300	million	*U*	for	Atlanta	's	IBM	Tower	last	year	.
Altogether	,	annual	Japanese	investment	in	U.S.	commercial	real	estate	grew	from	about	$	1.3	billion	*U*	in	1985	to	about	$	7.1	billion	*U*	in	1988	.
Many	Japanese	companies	have	taken	the	warnings	by	the	country	's	leaders	to	heart	and	sought	development	partnerships	rather	than	landmark	properties	.
Critics	say	0	Mitsubishi	Estate	's	decision	*	to	buy	into	Rockefeller	reflects	the	degree	to	which	companies	are	irritated	*-2	by	the	pressure	*	to	act	for	the	good	of	Japan	*T*-1	.
``	Those	who	*T*-1	have	no	money	and	*T*-1	are	n't	buying	think	0	it	*EXP*-3	's	right	*	to	refrain	,	but	those	with	money	who	*T*-193	want	*-4	to	buy	for	themselves	pay	no	attention	,	''	says	*T*-2	an	official	of	the	Japan-U.S	.	Business	Council	.
But	to	Mitsubishi	Estate	,	the	acquisition	has	just	the	elements	that	*T*-194	should	win	support	from	both	sides	.
First	of	all	,	it	is	a	friendly	acquisition	in	which	Rockefeller	sought	out	Mitsubishi	Estate	and	asked	it	*-2	to	buy	a	majority	share	*T*-1	.
Secondly	,	the	two	companies	found	a	similarity	in	their	business	and	development	philosophies	and	intend	*-1	to	cooperate	in	a	range	of	activities	from	real	estate	to	telecommunications	.
Finally	,	Mitsubishi	Estate	has	no	plans	*	to	interfere	with	Rockefeller	's	management	beyond	*-1	taking	a	place	on	the	board	.
``	We	'll	continue	*-2	to	work	with	them	,	in	keeping	with	the	reputation	of	the	company	,	and	we	'll	rely	very	much	on	their	leadership	,	''	says	*T*-1	Mitsubishi	Estate	President	Jotaro	Takagi	.
Rockefeller	may	well	have	found	its	match	in	Mitsubishi	Estate	,	a	company	of	long	history	,	strong	government	ties	and	sound	resources	.
In	asset	terms	,	Mitsubishi	Estate	is	the	largest	real	estate	firm	in	Japan	.
The	core	of	its	holdings	is	190,000	square	meters	of	incredibly	expensive	property	in	the	Marunouchi	district	,	the	business	and	financial	center	of	Tokyo	,	often	jokingly	called	*	``	Mitsubishi	Village	.	''
The	Mitsubishi	family	company	acquired	that	property	from	the	government	some	100	years	ago	when	it	was	a	portion	of	samurai	residential	land	running	from	the	moat	of	the	Imperial	Palace	east	toward	the	hodgepodge	of	tiny	shops	and	twisted	alleys	that	*T*-195	made	up	the	merchants	'	district	*T*-1	.
At	the	time	,	Japan	had	just	opened	its	doors	to	the	world	after	about	250	years	of	isolation	and	needed	a	Western-style	business	center	.
Mitsubishi	built	the	government	's	dream	development	,	the	story	goes	0	*T*-1	,	in	exchange	for	the	official	decision	*	to	locate	Tokyo	's	central	railway	station	there	.
That	was	just	an	early	step	in	a	relationship	with	government	that	*T*-196	has	earned	the	Mitsubishi	group	the	dubious	moniker	of	``	seisho	,	''	literally	government-business	,	a	title	that	*T*-197	has	the	pejorative	connotation	of	*	doing	the	government	's	bidding	,	but	also	suggests	the	clout	inherent	in	*	maintaining	such	close	ties	.
Mitsubishi	Estate	is	one	of	the	dozens	of	companies	in	today	's	Mitsubishi	group	.
It	's	known	*-1	for	its	cautiousness	in	part	because	it	has	had	little	need	for	bold	overseas	ventures	:	In	the	year	ended	March	31	,	57.4	%	of	its	total	revenue	came	from	office	building	management	.
Its	earnings	can	rise	10	%	to	12	%	*U*	annually	simply	from	the	natural	turnover	of	tenants	and	automatic	rent	increases	,	says	0	*T*-1	Graeme	McDonald	,	an	industry	analyst	at	James	Capel	Pacific	Ltd	.
For	the	latest	fiscal	year	,	the	company	's	net	income	jumped	a	robust	19	%	to	35.5	billion	yen	-LRB-	$	250.2	million	*U*	-RRB-	.
For	Mitsubishi	Estate	,	the	Rockefeller	purchase	will	catapult	it	firmly	into	the	overseas	real	estate	business	,	the	one	area	where	it	has	lagged	notably	behind	Japanese	competitors	such	as	Mitsui	,	which	*T*-198	had	purchased	the	Exxon	Building	*T*-1	.
``	Japanese	companies	need	*-1	to	invest	in	overseas	real	estate	for	diversification	,	''	says	0	*T*-2	Yoshio	Shima	,	an	industry	analyst	at	Goldman	Sachs	-LRB-	Japan	-RRB-	Corp	.
Rockefeller	is	n't	the	first	overseas	purchase	for	Mitsubishi	Estate	--	it	has	already	played	a	leading	role	in	*	designing	Los	Angeles	's	Citicorp	Plaza	.
But	the	Rockefeller	investment	is	its	largest	.
Nonetheless	,	it	will	barely	make	a	dent	in	Mitsubishi	Estate	's	finances	,	analysts	say	0	*T*-1	.
Mitsubishi	Estate	has	n't	decided	how	it	will	raise	the	funds	for	the	purchase	,	which	*T*-199	are	due	in	cash	next	April	*T*-1	,	but	the	Marunouchi	holdings	alone	are	estimated	*-2	to	have	a	market	value	of	as	much	as	10	trillion	yen	to	11	trillion	yen	.
Moreover	,	as	a	member	of	the	Mitsubishi	group	,	which	*T*-1	is	headed	*-180	by	one	of	Japan	's	largest	banks	,	it	*EXP*-2	is	sure	*	to	win	a	favorable	loan	.
Analysts	say	0	the	company	also	could	easily	issue	new	convertible	bonds	or	warrants	.
Meanwhile	,	at	home	,	Mitsubishi	has	control	of	some	major	projects	.
It	is	the	largest	private-sector	landowner	of	the	Minato-Mirai	21	project	,	a	multibillion-yen	development	in	the	port	city	of	Yokohama	,	about	an	hour	outside	Tokyo	.
The	project	is	one	of	a	select	group	of	public	projects	opened	*	to	U.S.	firms	under	a	U.S.-Japan	construction	trade	agreement	reached	*	last	year	.
The	centerpiece	of	that	complex	,	the	Landmark	Tower	,	will	be	Japan	's	tallest	building	when	it	is	completed	*-181	in	1993	*T*-1	.
Mitsubishi	is	also	pushing	ahead	with	a	controversial	plan	*	to	redevelop	Marunouchi	into	a	business	center	of	high-tech	buildings	,	a	project	budgeted	*	for	30	years	and	six	trillion	yen	.
Time	Warner	Inc.	and	Sony	Corp.	may	be	today	's	public	enemies	,	but	the	two	entertainment	giants	could	end	up	*-1	becoming	partners	in	a	number	of	ventures	as	part	of	a	settlement	of	their	acrimonious	legal	dispute	over	Hollywood	producers	Peter	Guber	and	Jon	Peters	.
The	Warner	Bros.	studio	and	Sony	signaled	0	they	are	close	to	a	settlement	yesterday	,	*-1	asking	a	Los	Angeles	Superior	Court	*-2	to	postpone	a	hearing	scheduled	*	for	tomorrow	on	Warner	's	request	for	a	preliminary	injunction	blocking	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	from	*-3	taking	the	top	posts	at	Columbia	Pictures	Entertainment	Inc	.
In	separate	statements	,	the	two	sides	said	0	they	want	*-1	to	have	``	further	discussions	.	''
Sony	is	acquiring	Columbia	and	Guber-Peters	Entertainment	Co.	in	two	separate	transactions	valued	*	at	more	than	$	5	billion	*U*	.
Warner	Communications	Inc.	,	which	*T*-1	is	being	acquired	*-182	by	Time	Warner	,	has	filed	a	$	1	billion	*U*	breach-of-contract	suit	against	Sony	and	the	two	producers	.
Warner	has	a	five-year	exclusive	contract	with	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	that	*T*-200	requires	them	to	make	movies	exclusively	at	the	Warner	Bros.	studio	.
The	two	sides	in	the	legal	battle	have	hurled	accusations	of	duplicity	at	each	other	for	weeks	,	and	both	Warner	and	Sony	have	accused	each	other	of	*-1	trying	*-2	to	sabotage	each	other	's	prospects	for	success	in	the	entertainment	business	.
But	it	may	amount	to	little	more	than	posturing	;	the	two	have	continued	on-again	,	off-again	settlement	talks	over	the	last	few	weeks	,	and	people	familiar	with	the	talks	say	0	the	matter	could	be	resolved	*-183	within	a	week	.
Both	Warner	and	Sony	declined	*-1	to	comment	on	the	terms	of	the	settlement	discussions	.
But	the	people	familiar	with	the	talks	said	that	Warner	is	n't	expected	*-1	to	get	any	cash	in	the	settlement	.
Instead	,	Sony	is	likely	*-1	to	agree	*-2	to	let	Warner	participate	in	certain	of	its	businesses	,	such	as	the	record	club	of	Sony	's	CBS	Records	unit	.
Warner	has	surpassed	Sony	as	the	largest	record	company	,	but	it	does	n't	have	a	powerful	world-wide	record	club	like	CBS	.
The	two	sides	are	also	discussing	certain	business	ventures	involving	cable	rights	to	Columbia	's	movies	.
In	addition	,	Sony	is	expected	*-1	to	agree	*-2	to	swap	Columbia	's	35	%	stake	in	the	sprawling	Burbank	,	Calif.	,	studio	that	Warner	and	Columbia	share	*T*-3	,	in	exchange	for	the	old	MGM	studio	lot	that	Warner	acquired	*T*-201	with	the	purchase	of	Lorimar	Telepictures	Corp	.
Still	,	it	*EXP*-2	may	be	tough	for	the	two	to	have	a	smooth	partnership	in	anything	,	in	the	wake	of	sworn	affidavits	filed	*	over	the	last	week	.
One	,	for	example	,	came	from	CBS	Records	Chairman	Walter	Yetnikoff	,	who	*T*-202	will	head	a	committee	that	*T*-203	will	oversee	Sony	's	entertainment	division	,	including	both	records	and	movies	.
In	his	affidavit	,	Mr.	Yetnikoff	accused	Warner	Chairman	Steven	J.	Ross	of	*-2	having	an	``	antiSony	,	anti-Japanese	bias	''	and	said	that	Mr.	Ross	had	tried	*-1	to	talk	him	out	of	*-3	letting	Sony	buy	CBS	Records	two	years	ago	for	that	reason	.
Mr.	Ross	,	who	*T*-204	will	be	chairman	and	co-chief	executive	officer	of	Time	Warner	after	the	merger	is	complete	,	denied	that	in	his	own	affidavit	,	and	called	Mr.	Yetnikoff	's	remarks	``	vicious	''	and	his	claims	``	reckless	,	irresponsible	and	baseless	,	''	*-1	saying	0	Warner	under	his	leadership	has	started	a	number	of	businesses	in	Japan	.
Mr.	Ross	also	said	0	he	enjoys	``	warm	professional	and	personal	relationships	''	with	Japanese	executives	including	Sony	Chairman	Akio	Morita	,	``	who	*T*-205	has	visited	my	home	here	.	''
But	despite	the	acrimony	between	Mr.	Ross	and	Mr.	Yetnikoff	,	officials	of	the	Time	side	of	Time	Warner	have	reportedly	been	increasingly	interested	in	a	settlement	that	*T*-206	might	yield	attractive	business	opportunities	.
Time	executives	such	as	the	company	's	president	,	N.J	.	Nicholas	,	who	*T*-207	will	eventually	be	co-chief	executive	of	Time	Warner	alongside	Mr.	Ross	,	have	no	personal	relationships	or	ego	at	stake	in	the	fight	over	the	Guber-Peters	duo	,	and	were	never	directly	drawn	*-1	into	the	fray	.
Talks	between	the	two	sides	could	unravel	,	of	course	,	as	they	have	more	than	once	since	Sony	announced	its	plans	*	to	hire	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	.
But	both	sides	appear	*-1	to	be	more	willing	*ICH*-2	now	*-3	to	meet	each	other	's	terms	*-4	to	resolve	the	issue	.
And	although	Warner	has	said	0	it	wanted	the	producers	to	fulfill	the	terms	of	their	contract	,	the	producers	said	in	sworn	court	declarations	that	they	did	n't	believe	0	the	relationship	could	be	repaired	*-184	after	the	acrimony	of	the	legal	battle	.
Any	settlement	is	also	expected	*-1	to	exclude	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	from	any	of	the	projects	0	they	were	working	on	*T*-2	at	Warner	.
The	Guber-Peters	duo	have	50	projects	in	various	stages	of	development	and	production	at	Warner	,	including	``	Bonfire	of	the	Vanities	''	and	``	A	Bright	Shining	Lie	.	''
But	that	does	n't	mean	0	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	might	not	eventually	get	their	hands	on	some	of	their	projects	;	studios	develop	hundreds	of	movies	but	produce	only	10	to	20	each	year	.
Once	a	studio	chooses	*-1	not	to	actually	make	a	movie	that	*T*-208	is	in	development	,	producers	are	typically	free	*-2	to	take	it	elsewhere	.
Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	also	almost	certainly	would	n't	be	able	*-1	to	participate	in	future	sequels	to	``	Batman	,	''	the	blockbuster	hit	0	they	produced	*T*-2	for	Warner	.
But	in	*-2	acquiring	Guber-Peters	Entertainment	,	Sony	will	actually	get	a	piece	of	the	profits	from	``	Batman	,	''	since	the	publicly	held	concern	gets	certain	revenue	from	the	movies	0	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	produce	*T*-1	.
The	two	producers	own	a	combined	28	%	stake	in	Guber-Peters	.
Southern	Co.	's	Gulf	Power	Co.	subsidiary	pleaded	guilty	to	two	felony	charges	of	conspiracy	*	to	make	illegal	political	contributions	and	tax	evasion	,	and	paid	$	500,000	*U*	in	fines	.
Gulf	Power	's	guilty	plea	before	U.S.	District	Judge	Robert	L.	Vining	yesterday	marks	the	end	of	only	one	part	of	a	wide-ranging	inquiry	of	Southern	Co	.
The	company	is	the	subject	of	a	federal	grand	jury	investigation	into	whether	its	officials	and	its	utility	subsidiaries	conspired	*-1	to	cover	up	their	accounting	for	spare	parts	*-2	to	evade	federal	income	taxes	.
``	The	terms	announced	today	are	strictly	between	the	United	States	and	Gulf	Power	,	''	said	*T*-1	U.S.	Attorney	Robert	L.	Barr	.
``	This	is	only	a	further	step	in	a	lengthy	investigation	.	''
The	plea	settlement	does	not	allow	Southern	Co.	to	charge	any	of	the	$	500,000	*U*	to	its	customers	,	or	take	action	against	employees	who	*T*-209	provided	information	during	the	federal	inquiry	.
Gulf	Power	had	been	under	investigation	for	*-1	violating	the	Utility	Holding	Company	Act	,	which	*T*-210	prohibits	public	utilities	from	*-2	making	political	contributions	.
In	a	statement	,	Southern	Co.	President	Edward	L.	Addison	said	,	``	We	believe	0	our	decision	*	to	plead	-LRB-	guilty	-RRB-	to	these	charges	is	responsible	and	proper	.
And	our	action	today	will	allow	Gulf	Power	to	avoid	prolonged	,	distracting	legal	proceedings	.	''
He	did	not	say	what	effect	,	if	any	,	the	$	500,000	*U*	fine	would	have	*T*-1	on	the	company	's	earnings	.
Mr.	Barr	said	0	yesterday	's	plea	by	Gulf	Power	,	which	*T*-212	came	after	months	of	negotiations	,	was	based	*-185	on	evidence	that	Gulf	Power	had	set	up	an	elaborate	payment	system	through	which	it	reimbursed	outside	vendors	--	primarily	three	Florida	advertising	agencies	--	for	*-2	making	illegal	political	contributions	on	its	behalf	*T*-1	.
The	Appleyard	Agency	,	for	example	,	allegedly	made	contributions	from	1982	to	1984	to	various	funds	for	political	candidates	,	then	submitted	bills	to	Gulf	Power	.
The	contributions	were	funded	*-186	by	monthly	payments	of	$	1,000	to	$	2,000	*U*	to	Appleyard	in	the	guise	of	a	``	special	production	fee	''	--	in	effect	,	*	hiding	the	nature	of	the	payments	from	the	Internal	Revenue	Service	,	federal	prosecutors	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	government	also	indicated	that	former	Gulf	Power	senior	vice	president	Jacob	F.	``	Jake	''	Horton	was	the	mastermind	behind	the	use	of	the	ad	agencies	--	Appleyard	,	Dick	Leonard	Group	II	Inc.	and	Hemmer	&	Yates	Corp.	--	*	to	make	payments	to	various	political	candidates	from	1981	to	1988	.
Mr.	Horton	,	who	*T*-213	oversaw	Gulf	Power	's	governmental-affairs	efforts	,	died	mysteriously	in	a	plane	crash	in	April	after	*-1	learning	0	he	might	be	fired	*-187	following	the	uncovering	of	irregularities	in	a	company	audit	.
Government	officials	declined	*-1	to	say	whether	the	investigation	includes	the	ad	agencies	or	the	politicians	involved	*	.
In	New	York	Stock	Exchange	trading	,	Southern	Co.	rose	50	cents	a	share	to	$	27.125	*U*	.
`	Frequent	Drinker	'	Offer	Stirs	Up	Spirited	Debate
*-1	TO	GRAB	a	bigger	piece	of	the	declining	scotch	market	,	Seagram	Co.	has	launched	a	controversial	``	frequent	drinker	''	promotion	for	its	Chivas	Regal	brand	.
Under	the	program	,	dubbed	*	Chivas	Class	,	customers	who	*T*-214	send	in	two	labels	from	Chivas	bottles	will	receive	an	upgrade	in	seating	class	on	some	Trans	World	Airlines	flights	.
Repeat	customers	also	can	purchase	luxury	items	at	reduced	prices	.
But	at	a	time	of	mounting	concern	over	alcohol	abuse	,	some	liquor	marketers	consider	Seagram	's	frequent	buyer	promotion	risky	.
``	I	'm	surprised	0	they	're	doing	this	,	''	says	*T*-1	Penn	Kavanagh	,	president	of	Schieffelin	&	Somerset	Co.	,	which	*T*-215	markets	Johnnie	Walker	scotches	.
``	I	would	be	very	leery	of	anything	that	*T*-216	says	if	you	drink	more	,	you	get	more	.	''
Others	question	the	impact	on	Chivas	's	upscale	image	of	a	promotion	that	*T*-217	has	customers	soaking	off	labels	.
``	It	's	really	bizarre	,	''	says	*T*-1	Albert	Lerman	,	creative	director	at	the	Wells	Rich	Greene	ad	agency	.
``	Chivas	has	an	image	of	something	0	you	would	savor	,	rather	than	guzzle	*T*-1	.	''
Chivas	Class	is	n't	the	first	such	promotion	.
Last	year	,	J&B	Scotch	offered	500	TWA	frequent	flier	miles	in	exchange	for	a	label	.
And	Dewar	's	gave	discounts	on	Scottish	merchandise	to	people	who	*T*-218	sent	in	bottle	labels	.
But	the	scope	of	Seagram	's	Chivas	promotion	sets	it	apart	.
The	current	campaign	is	just	the	first	leg	of	an	aggressive	three-to-five-year	direct	marketing	plan	.
Seagram	says	0	the	promotion	is	designed	*-1	to	build	brand	loyalty	rather	than	promote	heavy	drinking	.
Seagram	asks	customers	*-2	to	buy	only	two	or	three	bottles	over	a	12-month	period	,	says	0	*T*-1	Richard	Shaw	,	vice	president	of	U.S.	direct	marketing	.
``	We	're	not	asking	them	*-1	to	save	up	50	proof-of-purchases	.
We	're	not	saying	*	drink	more	,	we	're	saying	*	trade	up	.	''
Goya	Concocts	a	Milk	For	Hispanic	Tastes
MOST	FOOD	companies	these	days	are	trimming	the	fat	and	cholesterol	content	of	their	products	*-1	to	appeal	to	health-conscious	consumers	.
But	Goya	Foods	Inc.	believes	0	it	can	milk	some	sales	by	*-1	bucking	the	trend	.
The	Secaucus	,	N.J.	,	company	has	formed	a	joint	venture	with	a	distributor	called	*	La	Lecheria	*-1	to	market	a	higher-fat	milk	targeted	*	at	Hispanic	consumers	.
*	To	give	Leche	Fresca	the	creamier	taste	0	Goya	says	0	Hispanics	prefer	*T*-1	,	the	new	brand	has	a	butterfat	content	of	3.8	%	.
That	compares	with	3.5	%	butterfat	for	whole	milk	.
A	spokesman	for	Borden	Inc.	,	the	nation	's	largest	milk	producer	,	concedes	0	Goya	may	be	on	to	something	.
Borden	sells	considerably	more	whole	milk	than	reduced-fat	milks	in	southern	and	Hispanic	markets	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	.
Borden	even	tested	a	milk	with	4	%	butterfat	in	the	South	,	but	decided	0	the	market	was	too	small	.
Goya	is	selling	Leche	Fresca	in	nearly	500	grocery	stores	and	bodegas	in	New	York	and	parts	of	New	Jersey	.
And	it	's	adding	15	to	20	new	outlets	a	day	,	says	0	*T*-1	Greg	Ricca	,	sales	director	at	La	Lecheria	.
Because	of	Leche	Fresca	's	success	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	,	the	joint	venture	is	developing	other	dairy	products	tailored	*	to	Hispanic	tastes	.
Jewelry	Makers	Copy	Cosmetics	Sales	Ploys
FOR	YEARS	,	costume	jewelry	makers	fought	a	losing	battle	.
Jewelry	displays	in	department	stores	were	often	cluttered	and	uninspired	.
And	the	merchandise	was	,	well	,	fake	.
As	a	result	,	marketers	of	faux	gems	steadily	lost	space	in	department	stores	to	more	fashionable	rivals	--	cosmetics	makers	.
But	lately	,	retailers	say	0	*T*-1	,	fake	has	become	more	fashionable	.
And	jewelry	makers	are	beginning	*-1	to	use	many	of	the	same	marketing	tricks	honed	*	in	the	aggressive	world	of	cosmetics	.
Last	year	,	the	total	women	's	fashion	jewelry	business	topped	$	4.9	billion	*U*	,	says	0	*T*-1	Karen	Alberg	,	editor	of	Accessories	magazine	.
And	it	's	growing	fast	,	with	annual	sales	gains	of	more	than	10	%	.
*-1	To	increase	their	share	of	that	business	,	jewelry	makers	such	as	Crystal	Brands	Inc.	's	Trifari	and	Monet	units	and	Swank	Inc.	,	maker	of	Anne	Klein	jewelry	,	are	launching	new	lines	with	as	much	fanfare	as	the	fragrance	companies	.
They	're	hiring	models	0	*T*-1	to	stroll	the	aisles	*-2	sporting	their	jewels	,	and	they	're	even	beginning	*-4	to	borrow	a	perennial	favorite	of	the	beauty	business	--	*	offering	a	gift	when	consumers	make	a	purchase	*T*-3	.
``	We	've	started	*-2	trying	just	about	anything	*-3	to	keep	sales	moving	in	the	stores	,	''	says	*T*-1	Kim	Renk	,	a	Swank	vice	president	.
But	there	are	limits	.
Ms.	Renk	says	0	retailers	nixed	a	promotion	for	pins	with	animal	motifs	.
Her	idea	:	*	bring	in	live	zoo	animals	.
Trifari	,	whose	national	ads	*T*-219	earlier	this	year	included	paper	cutouts	of	its	costume	finery	,	takes	a	tamer	approach	.
The	company	focuses	on	the	how-to	aspects	,	says	0	*T*-1	Andrew	E.	Philip	,	president	.
Trifari	now	trains	sales	help	to	advise	customers	on	the	best	earring	styles	.
But	cosmetics	firms	still	have	one	big	marketing	edge	:	They	motivate	sales	people	with	commissions	.
Jewelry	makers	rarely	pay	commissions	and	are	n't	expected	*-1	to	*?*	anytime	soon	.

A	total	of	157	lawsuits	were	filed	*-189	on	behalf	of	crash	victims	.
U.S.	District	Judge	Julian	A.	Cook	Jr.	announced	the	settlements	as	the	jury	trial	was	*-1	to	begin	yesterday	.
He	reset	opening	arguments	for	today	.
The	jury	will	resolve	the	claims	against	McDonnell	Douglas	,	Northwest	's	claim	that	a	defect	in	the	aircraft	caused	the	crash	,	and	McDonnell	Douglas	'	claim	that	the	plane	was	improperly	flown	*-1	.
The	National	Transportation	Safety	Board	ruled	that	pilots	failed	*-1	to	set	the	plane	's	wing	flaps	and	slats	properly	for	takeoff	and	failed	*-1	to	make	mandatory	preflight	checks	that	*T*-221	would	have	detected	the	error	.
Also	,	a	cockpit	warning	system	failed	*-1	to	alert	the	pilots	0	the	flaps	and	slats	were	not	set	*-3	for	takeoff	,	the	NTSB	said	0	*T*-2	.

She	now	lives	with	relatives	in	Alabama	.
Sun	Myung	Moon	,	the	Korean	evangelist-industrialist	who	*T*-1	in	1954	founded	the	Unification	Church	,	remains	the	mystery	man	behind	a	multimillion-dollar	political	and	publishing	operation	based	*	in	this	country	and	catering	to	the	American	right	.
But	there	may	be	less	there	than	*	meets	the	eye	.
Mr.	Moon	planned	*-1	to	convert	millions	of	Americans	to	his	unique	brand	of	Christianity	--	in	which	he	plays	the	role	of	Old	Testament-style	temporal	,	political	messiah	*T*-2	--	and	then	to	make	the	U.S.	part	of	a	unified	international	theocracy	.
His	original	strategy	-LRB-	in	itself	a	brilliant	innovation	for	*	spreading	a	religion	-RRB-	was	*	to	create	new	economic	enterprises	each	time	0	he	wanted	*-2	to	extend	and	fund	his	various	religious	missions	*T*-1	.
Tax-exempt	airport	and	street-corner	solicitations	were	intended	*-190	only	to	provide	start-up	funds	.
More	stable	industries	were	*	to	build	an	economically	viable	infrastructure	for	the	Moon	movement	in	North	America	,	as	they	had	*?*	in	Japan	and	South	Korea	.
Then	he	would	move	his	movement	to	Europe	.
But	that	was	not	*-1	to	be	.
Throughout	the	1970s	and	early	1980s	spokesmen	for	both	the	Unification	Church	and	its	opponents	in	the	anticult	movement	gave	wildly	exaggerated	membership	figures	.
Their	legacy	lives	on	.
It	*EXP*-2	is	still	common	*	to	read	in	the	press	that	the	church	has	10,000	or	more	full-time	American	members	and	25,000	``	associates	.	''
Some	estimates	have	gone	as	high	as	80,000	members	.
But	internal	church	documents	clearly	show	that	at	its	publicity-seeking	heights	,	as	when	it	organized	a	spectacular	Yankee	Stadium	bicentennial	rally	in	1976	*T*-1	,	there	actually	were	only	about	2,000	full-time	Unification	Church	members	in	the	U.S.
Mr.	Moon	's	support	for	a	Watergate-beleaguered	Richard	Nixon	,	the	Koreagate	scandal	,	and	his	prison	sentence	for	income-tax	evasion	did	not	help	the	church	's	recruitment	efforts	.
Defections	,	burnouts	,	and	abduction	``	deprogrammings	''	kept	member	turnover	high	.
That	the	membership	number	has	even	kept	close	to	its	1976	size	is	the	result	of	the	``	graying	''	of	the	church	.
Many	of	the	enthusiastic	young	``	Moonies	''	of	the	Nixon	era	who	*T*-224	remained	faithful	to	Father	Moon	are	now	parents	,	producing	new	members	by	procreation	rather	than	conversion	.
The	reputed	wealth	of	the	Unification	Church	is	another	matter	of	contention	.
For	a	while	in	the	1970s	it	seemed	0	Mr.	Moon	was	on	a	spending	spree	,	with	such	purchases	as	the	former	New	Yorker	Hotel	and	its	adjacent	Manhattan	Center	;	a	fishing\/processing	conglomerate	with	branches	in	Alaska	,	Massachusetts	,	Virginia	and	Louisiana	;	a	former	Christian	Brothers	monastery	and	the	Seagram	family	mansion	-LRB-	both	picturesquely	situated	on	the	Hudson	River	-RRB-	;	shares	in	banks	from	Washington	to	Uruguay	;	a	motion	picture	production	company	,	and	newspapers	,	such	as	the	Washington	Times	,	the	New	York	City	Tribune	-LRB-	originally	the	News	World	-RRB-	,	and	the	successful	Spanish-language	Noticias	del	Mundo	.
Yet	these	purchases	can	be	misleading	.
Most	were	obtained	*-191	with	huge	inputs	of	church	money	from	South	Korea	and	Japan	,	minimum	cash	downpayments	and	sizable	mortgages	.
Those	teams	of	young	fund-raisers	selling	flowers	,	peanuts	or	begging	outright	at	traffic	intersections	brought	in	somewhere	near	$	20	million	*U*	a	year	during	the	mid-to-late	1970s	,	but	those	revenues	were	a	pittance	compared	to	the	costs	of	Mr.	Moon	's	lavish	international	conferences	,	speaking	tours	,	and	assorted	land	buys	.
Only	his	factories	in	Japan	and	Korea	,	*-1	employing	his	followers	at	subsistence	wages	and	producing	everything	from	rifles	to	ginseng	to	expensive	marble	vases	,	kept	the	money	flowing	westward	.
Virginia	Commonwealth	University	sociologist	David	Bromley	,	who	*T*-1	more	than	any	other	researcher	has	delved	into	the	complex	world	of	Unificationist	finances	,	has	concluded	that	profitable	operations	in	the	U.S.	have	been	the	exceptions	rather	than	the	rule	.
Likewise	,	journalists	John	Burgess	and	Michael	Isikoff	of	the	Washington	Post	have	estimated	that	at	least	$	800	million	*U*	was	transferred	*-192	from	Japan	to	the	U.S.	*	to	deal	with	the	church	's	annual	operating	losses	in	this	country	.
Mr.	Moon	's	two	English-language	U.S.	newspapers	illustrate	the	scope	of	this	financial	drain	.
Start-up	costs	for	the	Washington	Times	alone	were	close	to	$	50	million	*U*	,	and	the	total	amount	lost	*	in	this	journalistic	black	hole	was	estimated	*-193	at	$	150	million	*U*	by	1984	.
Since	then	,	Moon	's	organization	has	inaugurated	a	pair	of	high-quality	glossy	opinion	magazines	,	The	World	and	I	and	Insight	,	which	*T*-225	are	a	further	drain	.
Insiders	say	that	not	even	their	editors	know	for	sure	how	much	these	show-piece	publications	,	along	with	the	newspapers	,	have	cost	Mr.	Moon	*T*-1	.
Many	American	church-owned	businesses	,	such	as	a	$	30	million	*U*	factory	0	*T*-1	to	build	fishing	vessels	,	are	defunct	.
Some	components	of	the	American	church	had	their	budgets	cut	in	half	last	year	and	again	this	year	.
The	relatively	small	academic	conferences	that	*T*-226	have	attracted	conservative	guests	--	and	press	scrutiny	--	in	recent	years	are	much	more	narrowly	targeted	and	austere	than	the	thousand-person	get-togethers	in	fancy	digs	and	exotic	locales	of	years	past	.
I	attended	several	of	these	in	the	dual	role	as	a	presenter	of	research	findings	as	well	as	an	investigator	of	my	hosts	.
-LRB-	Mr.	Moon	's	Paragon	House	eventually	even	published	three	of	my	co-edited	books	on	religion	and	politics	.	-RRB-
According	to	veteran	watchers	of	Unificationist	affairs	,	such	as	Dr.	J.	Gordon	Melton	,	director	of	the	Institute	for	the	Study	of	American	Religion	,	almost	all	operations	are	being	drastically	reduced	*-1	as	Mr.	Moon	now	concentrates	more	on	*-2	developing	his	empire	in	the	Far	East	.
``	Everything	,	''	one	non-``	Moonie	''	senior	consultant	to	the	Unification	Church	recently	told	me	in	an	interview	*T*-1	,	``	is	going	back	to	Korea	and	Japan	.	''
-LRB-	Europe	had	proved	even	less	hospitable	than	North	America	.
European	politicians	were	less	reluctant	*-1	to	have	their	governments	investigate	and	harass	new	religions	.	-RRB-
So	Mr.	Moon	is	in	retreat	,	*-1	refocusing	on	the	Far	East	.
South	Korea	and	Japan	continue	*-1	to	be	profitable	.
Moon	's	Tong'Il	industry	conglomerate	is	now	investing	heavily	in	China	,	where	church	accountants	have	high	hopes	of	*	expanding	and	attracting	converts	even	in	the	wake	of	the	bloody	massacre	in	Tiananmen	Square	*T*-1	.
Panda	Motors	is	one	such	investment	.
According	to	senior	consultants	to	the	church	,	Mr.	Moon	has	successfully	negotiated	a	joint	venture	with	the	Chinese	government	0	*T*-1	to	build	an	automobile-parts	plant	in	Guangdong	Province	,	an	area	of	China	with	a	substantial	Korean	minority	.
Mr.	Moon	has	agreed	*-1	to	put	up	$	10	million	*U*	a	year	for	25	years	and	keep	the	profits	in	China	.
In	return	,	he	has	the	government	's	blessing	*	to	build	churches	and	spread	Unificationism	in	that	country	.
Whatever	respectability	and	ties	to	intellectuals	and	opinion-makers	0	the	publications	and	conferences	bring	*T*-1	really	are	salvage	--	not	the	Rev.	Moon	's	original	final	goals	,	but	the	ones	for	which	he	will	have	*	to	settle	*T*-2	.

The	law	is	meant	*-1	to	overcome	delays	caused	*	by	defendants	'	use	of	foreign	procedures	*	to	block	U.S.	requests	for	records	,	Judge	Keenan	said	0	*T*-3	in	his	opinion	.
For	instance	,	the	documents	could	involve	foreign	business	dealings	or	bank	accounts	.
The	U.S.	has	charged	that	the	Marcoses	'	alleged	crimes	involved	bank	accounts	in	the	Philippines	,	Hong	Kong	,	the	U.S.	and	other	countries	.
On	the	allegation	of	kidnapping	,	Judge	Keenan	wrote	,	``	The	suggestion	that	Mrs.	Marcos	was	brought	*-206	to	this	country	against	her	will	is	unsupported	by	affidavit	or	affirmation	.	''
The	judge	also	said	0	the	two	marital	testimonial	privileges	cited	*	by	Mrs.	Marcos	do	n't	apply	.
The	first	one	permits	a	witness	*-1	to	refuse	*-2	to	testify	against	her	spouse	.
But	Judge	Keenan	said	0	that	privilege	's	purpose	is	``	fostering	harmony	in	marriage	.	''
Because	Mr.	Marcos	died	Sept.	28	,	the	privilege	can	no	longer	apply	,	the	judge	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	second	marital	privilege	cited	*	by	Mrs.	Marcos	protects	confidential	communications	between	spouses	.
But	Judge	Keenan	said	0	that	privilege	is	meant	*-1	to	protect	private	utterances	--	not	litigation	papers	filed	*	with	foreign	governments	,	as	Mrs.	Marcos	's	attorneys	maintained	.
Though	Judge	Keenan	threw	out	most	of	Mrs.	Marcos	's	objections	,	he	agreed	with	one	of	her	concerns	:	that	*	turning	over	the	foreign	documents	could	violate	the	defendant	's	constitutional	right	against	self-incrimination	.
As	a	result	,	he	said	0	he	will	examine	the	Marcos	documents	sought	*	by	the	prosecutors	*-1	to	determine	whether	*	turning	over	the	filings	is	self-incrimination	.
Judge	Keenan	also	directed	the	prosecutors	*-1	to	show	that	Mrs.	Marcos	's	Fifth	Amendment	right	against	self-incrimination	wo	n't	be	violated	*-207	.
Mrs.	Marcos	's	attorney	in	New	York	,	Sandor	Frankel	,	declined	*-1	to	comment	on	the	ruling	.
Mrs.	Marcos	has	n't	admitted	that	she	filed	any	documents	such	as	those	sought	*	by	the	government	.
Charles	LaBella	,	the	assistant	U.S.	attorney	prosecuting	the	Marcos	case	,	did	n't	return	phone	calls	seeking	comment	.
U.S.	.	AND	BRITISH	LAW	FIRMS	announce	rare	joint	venture	in	Tokyo	.
Sidley	&	Austin	,	a	leading	Chicago-based	law	firm	,	and	Ashurst	Morris	Crisp	,	a	midsized	London	firm	of	solicitors	,	are	scheduled	today	*-208	to	announce	plans	*	to	open	a	joint	office	in	Tokyo	.
The	firms	will	be	registered	*-209	under	Japanese	law	as	foreign	legal	consultants	and	their	practice	with	Japanese	clients	will	be	limited	*-210	to	*	advising	them	on	matters	of	foreign	law	.
The	office	may	also	be	able	*-1	to	advise	foreign	and	multinational	clients	on	international	law	and	general	matters	.
The	office	will	provide	``	one-stop	shopping	''	for	Japanese	financial	institutions	and	other	clients	seeking	advice	on	access	to	the	world	capital	markets	,	according	to	A.	Bruce	Schimberg	,	Sidley	's	senior	banking	specialist	,	who	*T*-235	will	move	to	Tokyo	from	Chicago	*-1	to	open	the	office	next	year	.
The	Sidley-Ashurst	venture	will	also	be	staffed	*-211	by	another	Sidley	partner	specializing	in	corporate	law	,	a	partner	from	Ashurst	concentrating	on	acquisitions	and	a	Japanese	attorney	.
The	office	will	tap	the	resources	of	Sidley	's	700	lawyers	in	the	U.S.	,	London	and	Singapore	as	well	as	the	400	Ashurst	staff	members	in	London	and	Brussels	.
Ashurst	is	new	to	the	Far	East	.
Sidley	will	maintain	its	association	with	the	Hashidate	Law	Office	in	Tokyo	.
THE	UNITED	AUTO	WORKERS	said	0	it	will	seek	a	rehearing	of	a	U.S.	appellate	court	ruling	against	the	union	's	claim	that	the	state	of	Michigan	engages	in	wage-discrimination	against	female	employees	.
A	three-judge	panel	of	the	court	in	Cincinnati	made	the	ruling	Saturday	.
The	UAW	is	seeking	a	hearing	by	the	full	14-judge	panel	.
The	union	sued	the	state	in	November	1985	,	*-1	alleging	that	it	intentionally	segregated	job	classifications	by	sex	and	paid	employees	in	predominantly	female	jobs	less	than	males	in	comparable	jobs	.
The	UAW	also	charged	that	the	state	applied	its	own	standards	for	*	determining	pay	in	a	discriminatory	manner	.
In	November	1987	,	a	district	court	judge	in	Detroit	ruled	against	the	UAW	.
The	union	is	the	bargaining	representative	for	more	than	20,000	Michigan	state	employees	.
NEW	JERSEY	MERGER	:
One	of	the	largest	law	firms	in	central	New	Jersey	has	been	created	*-212	through	the	merger	of	Norris	,	McLaughlin	&	Marcus	,	a	41-lawyer	firm	,	and	Manger	,	Kalison	,	McBride	&	Webb	,	a	health-care	specialty	law	firm	with	14	lawyers	.
Norris	McLaughlin	is	a	general-practice	firm	that	*T*-236	has	expanded	recently	into	such	specialties	as	banking	,	labor	and	environmental	work	.
The	merged	firm	will	carry	Norris	McLaughlin	's	name	.
DRUG	WARS	:
A	Texas	legislator	proposes	*	color-coding	drivers	'	licenses	of	some	drug	offenders	.
The	bill	would	authorize	courts	to	order	the	licenses	as	a	condition	of	probation	.
State	Senator	J.E.	``	Buster	''	Brown	,	a	Republican	who	*T*-237	is	running	for	Texas	attorney	general	,	introduced	the	bill	.
He	said	0	an	altered	license	would	be	an	``	embarrassment	''	to	teenagers	and	young	adults	and	would	act	as	a	deterrant	to	drug	use	.
Richard	Avena	,	executive	director	of	the	Texas	Civil	Liberties	Union	,	called	the	proposal	``	political	gimmickry	,	''	and	said	0	it	fails	*-1	to	recognize	the	drug	problem	as	a	health	issue	.
The	amendment	,	offered	*	by	Rep.	Douglas	Bosco	-LRB-	D.	,	Calif.	-RRB-	,	was	approved	*-1	283-132	during	debate	on	a	bill	designed	*	to	strengthen	the	Transportation	Department	's	authority	in	*	dealing	with	leveraged	buy-outs	of	airlines	.
The	bill	would	require	the	agency	to	block	the	acquisition	of	15	%	or	more	*U*	of	an	airline	's	stock	if	the	purchase	threatened	safety	,	reduced	the	carrier	's	ability	*	to	compete	,	or	put	the	airline	under	foreign	control	.
Debate	on	the	legislation	,	which	*T*-238	faces	a	veto	threat	from	President	Bush	,	is	*-1	to	continue	today	.
The	amendment	would	require	the	department	to	block	the	purchase	of	a	major	airline	by	anyone	who	*T*-239	has	run	two	or	more	carriers	that	*T*-240	have	filed	for	protection	from	creditors	under	Chapter	11	of	the	Bankruptcy	Code	.
In	1983	,	Texas	Air	's	Continental	Airlines	filed	for	bankruptcy	.
Earlier	this	year	,	Texas	Air	's	Eastern	Airlines	filed	for	bankruptcy	.
``	This	ought	*-2	to	be	subtitled	*-3	the	`	*	Do	n't	let	Frank	Lorenzo	take	over	another	airline	'	amendment	,	''	said	*T*-1	Rep.	James	Oberstar	-LRB-	D.	,	Minn.	-RRB-	,	chairman	of	the	House	aviation	subcommittee	,	who	*T*-241	argued	that	the	provision	was	unnecessary	because	the	bill	already	would	give	the	department	ample	power	*	to	block	undesirable	deals	.
For	years	,	a	strict	regimen	governed	the	staff	meetings	at	Nissan	Motor	Co.	's	technical	center	in	Tokyo	's	western	suburbs	.
Employees	wore	identification	badges	listing	not	only	their	names	but	also	their	dates	of	hire	.
No	one	could	voice	an	opinion	until	everybody	with	more	seniority	had	spoken	first	,	so	younger	employees	--	often	the	most	enthusiastic	and	innovative	--	seldom	spoke	up	at	all	.
But	in	1986	,	the	badges	and	the	``	*	do	n't	speak	out	of	turn	''	rule	were	abolished	*-215	--	early	steps	in	a	cultural	revolution	still	rolling	on	with	all	the	subtlety	of	a	freight	train	.
In	recent	years	,	Nissan	has	instituted	flex-time	work	schedules	and	allowed	employees	to	dress	casually	,	even	in	blue	jeans	.
A	rule	forbidding	staffers	*-1	to	own	competitors	'	cars	has	been	lifted	*-216	,	and	now	many	designers	drive	foreign	cars	*-2	to	get	useful	ideas	.
Nissan	's	decades-old	corporate	song	filled	*	with	references	to	Mount	Fuji	has	been	scrapped	*-217	in	favor	of	a	snappy	tune	sung	*	by	a	popular	Japanese	vocalist	.
And	in	a	Japanese	corporate	first	,	Nissan	recently	opened	the	first	coed	company	dormitory	for	single	employees	at	the	suburban	Tokyo	technical	center	.
``	We	had	lots	of	internal	debate	about	this	one	,	''	concedes	*T*-1	Tadahiko	Fukuyama	,	a	senior	public-relations	official	.
``	But	in	the	end	,	top	management	decided	*-1	to	follow	the	voice	of	the	younger	generation	.	''
This	corporate	glasnost	is	a	big	reason	0	Nissan	,	after	years	of	*	making	lackluster	cars	and	lousy	profits	,	has	loosened	up	its	rigid	ways	and	now	is	riding	a	string	of	hits	,	ranging	from	the	sleek	Maxima	sedan	and	Porsche-like	300ZX	to	the	whimsically	nostalgic	Pao	,	a	minicar	sold	*	only	in	Japan	*T*-1	.
The	company	's	turnaround	is	far	from	complete	;	many	crucial	tests	are	just	beginning	.
But	its	surprising	progress	so	far	holds	important	lessons	for	companies	in	trouble	.
The	big	one	:	A	company	's	culture	ca	n't	be	radically	changed	*-1	unless	top	management	first	admits	that	things	have	gone	badly	awry	and	then	publicly	leads	the	charge	.
Atsushi	Muramatsu	,	Nissan	's	executive	vice	president	for	finance	,	helped	*-2	set	the	tone	in	December	1986	,	when	the	company	was	heading	toward	the	first	operating	loss	by	a	Japanese	auto	maker	since	the	nation	's	postwar	recovery	*T*-1	.
``	This	is	a	time	of	self-criticism	0	*	to	discover	what	*T*-242	is	wrong	with	us	*T*-2	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
Yutaka	Kume	,	who	*T*-243	took	the	helm	as	Nissan	's	president	in	June	1985	,	added	simply	,	``	I	am	deeply	disappointed	.	''
No	wonder	.
Nissan	,	Japan	's	second-largest	auto	maker	and	the	world	's	fourth-largest	,	was	getting	beat	up	*-1	not	only	by	its	bigger	rival	,	Toyota	Motor	Corp.	,	but	also	by	Honda	Motor	Co.	,	the	most	successful	Japanese	car	company	in	the	U.S.	but	a	relative	pipsqueak	in	Japan	.
Nissan	's	market	share	in	Japan	had	been	dropping	year	by	year	since	the	beginning	of	the	decade	.
Its	U.S.	sales	sagged	,	partly	because	of	price	increases	due	to	the	rising	yen	.
Worst	of	all	,	Nissan	was	preoccupied	*-218	with	management	infighting	,	cronyism	and	corporate	rigidity	.
*	Consider	the	experience	of	Satoko	Kitada	,	a	30-year-old	designer	of	vehicle	interiors	who	*T*-244	joined	Nissan	in	1982	.
At	that	time	,	tasks	were	assigned	*-219	strictly	on	the	basis	of	seniority	.
``	The	oldest	designer	got	*-1	to	work	on	the	dashboard	,	''	she	recalls	*T*-2	.
``	The	next	level	down	did	doors	.
If	a	new	person	got	*-1	to	work	on	part	of	the	speedometer	,	that	was	a	big	deal	.	''
This	system	produced	boring	,	boxy	cars	that	consumers	just	were	n't	buying	*T*-245	.
*-2	Desperately	hoping	*-1	to	spark	sales	,	Nissan	transferred	5,000	middle	managers	and	plant	workers	to	dealerships	.
Meanwhile	,	President	Kume	ordered	everyone	from	top	executives	to	rookie	designers	to	go	``	town	watching	,	''	*-1	to	visit	chic	parts	of	Tokyo	*-3	to	try	*-2	to	gain	insights	into	*	developing	cars	for	trend-setters	.
Some	town-watching	excursions	were	downright	comic	.
One	group	of	middle-aged	manufacturing	men	from	the	company	's	Zama	plant	outside	Tokyo	was	supposed	*-1	to	check	out	a	trendy	restaurant	in	the	city	.
But	when	they	arrived	at	the	door	*T*-1	,	all	were	afraid	*-2	to	go	in	,	*-2	fearing	that	they	would	be	out	of	place	.
Other	trips	were	more	productive	.
Mr.	Kume	himself	visited	Honda	's	headquarters	in	Tokyo	's	upscale	Aoyama	district	.
He	liked	the	well-lighted	lobby	display	of	Honda	's	cars	and	trucks	so	much	that	he	had	Nissan	's	gloomy	lobby	exhibit	refurbished	.
Later	,	Nissan	borrowed	other	Honda	practices	,	including	an	engineering	``	idea	contest	''	0	*T*-1	to	promote	inventiveness	.
One	engineer	developed	a	``	crab	car	''	that	*T*-246	moves	sideways	.
Such	sudden	cultural	shifts	may	come	across	as	a	bit	forced	,	but	they	seem	*-1	to	be	genuine	--	so	much	so	,	in	fact	,	that	some	older	employees	have	resisted	.
Nissan	handled	the	die-hards	in	a	typically	Japanese	fashion	:	They	were	n't	fired	*-2	but	instead	``	were	neglected	*-2	,	''	says	0	*T*-1	Kouji	Hori	,	the	personnel	manager	at	the	Nissan	Technical	Center	.
Despite	the	pain	of	adjusting	,	the	cultural	revolution	has	begun	*-1	to	yield	exciting	cars	.
A	year	ago	,	the	company	completely	revamped	its	near-luxury	sedan	,	the	$	17,699	*U*	Maxima	,	which	*T*-247	competes	against	a	broad	range	of	upscale	sedans	;	it	replaced	its	boxy	,	pug-nosed	body	with	sleek	,	aerodynamic	lines	.
Since	then	,	Nissan	also	has	launched	new	versions	of	the	$	13,249	*U*	240SX	sporty	coupe	and	300ZX	sports	car	.
The	restyled	300ZX	costs	as	much	as	$	33,000	*U*	and	is	squared	off	against	the	Porche	944	,	which	*T*-248	begins	at	$	41,900	*U*	.
Besides	new	styling	,	the	new	Nissans	have	more	powerful	engines	and	more	sophisticated	suspension	systems	.
All	three	new	models	are	outselling	their	predecessors	by	wide	margins	.
In	its	home	market	,	Nissan	has	grabbed	attention	with	limited-production	minicars	featuring	styling	odd	enough	*	to	be	cute	.
One	is	the	Pao	,	a	tiny	coupe	with	a	peelback	canvas	top	and	tilted	headlights	that	*T*-249	give	it	a	droopy-eyed	look	.
Nissan	initially	planned	*-1	to	sell	just	10,000	Paos	,	but	sales	have	passed	50,000	,	and	there	's	a	one-year	waiting	list	for	the	car	.
Then	,	there	's	the	S-Cargo	,	an	offbeat	delivery	van	with	a	snail-like	body	that	*T*-250	inspired	its	name	.
Nissan	helped	*-1	develop	a	Tokyo	restaurant	with	both	vehicles	as	its	design	theme	.
The	chairs	are	S-Cargo	seats	,	and	a	gift	shop	sells	such	items	as	alarm	clocks	styled	*	like	the	Pao	's	oversized	speedometer	.
All	these	vehicles	have	sharply	improved	Nissan	's	morale	and	image	--	but	have	n't	done	much	for	its	market	share	.
Nissan	had	29	%	of	the	Japanese	car	market	in	1980	before	*-1	beginning	a	depressing	eight-year	slide	that	*T*-251	continued	through	last	year	.
Strong	sales	so	far	this	year	are	certain	*-1	to	turn	the	tide	,	but	even	the	25	%	market	share	that	Nissan	expects	*T*-252	in	1989	will	leave	it	far	below	its	position	at	the	beginning	of	the	decade	.
Nissan	concedes	that	it	wo	n't	recoup	all	its	market-share	losses	in	Japan	until	at	least	1995	,	and	even	that	timetable	might	prove	optimistic	.
``	Everyone	else	is	going	*-2	to	catch	up	''	with	Nissan	's	innovative	designs	,	says	0	*T*-1	A.	Rama	Krishna	,	auto	analyst	at	First	Boston	-LRB-	Japan	-RRB-	Ltd	.
Nissan	's	pace	of	new-model	hits	will	slow	,	he	adds	0	*T*-1	,	just	as	arch-rival	Toyota	unleashes	its	own	batch	of	new	cars	.
Likewise	,	in	the	U.S.	,	Nissan	has	grabbed	5.2	%	of	the	car	market	so	far	this	year	,	up	from	4.5	%	a	year	ago	.
But	even	that	brings	Nissan	only	to	the	share	0	it	had	*T*-1	in	1987	,	and	leaves	the	company	behind	its	high	of	5.5	%	in	1980	and	1982	.
Why	?
So	far	,	Nissan	's	new-model	successes	are	mostly	specialized	vehicles	with	limited	sales	potential	.
In	compact	and	subcompact	cars	,	the	bread-and-butter	sales	generators	for	Japanese	auto	makers	,	Nissan	still	trails	Toyota	and	Honda	.
Nissan	hopes	that	that	will	start	*-1	to	change	this	fall	,	with	its	new	version	of	the	Stanza	compact	sedan	.
The	Stanza	has	been	a	nonentity	compared	with	Honda	's	hugely	successful	Accord	and	Toyota	's	Camry	.
But	this	year	,	Honda	has	revamped	the	Accord	and	made	it	a	midsized	car	.
Nissan	instead	has	kept	its	new	Stanza	a	bit	smaller	than	that	and	cut	the	base	price	6	%	;	at	$	11,450	*U*	,	Stanza	prices	start	$	749	*U*	below	the	predecessor	model	yet	have	a	more-powerful	engine	.
Accord	prices	start	at	$	12,345	*U*	.
Nissan	's	risk	is	that	its	low-base-price	strategy	might	get	lost	*-1	amid	the	highly	publicized	rebates	being	offered	*	by	Detroit	's	Big	Three	.
But	``	on	a	new	car	,	a	rebate	does	n't	work	well	''	because	it	cheapens	the	vehicle	's	image	,	contends	0	*T*-1	Thomas	D.	Mignanelli	,	executive	vice	president	of	Nissan	's	U.S.	sales	arm	.
Even	if	the	new	Stanza	succeeds	,	Nissan	will	remain	behind	in	the	subcompact	segment	,	where	its	Sentra	does	n't	measure	up	to	the	Honda	Civic	and	Toyota	Corolla	*T*-1	.
Nissan	will	introduce	a	completely	revamped	Sentra	next	fall	.
At	the	opposite	end	of	the	market	,	Nissan	launches	its	luxury	Infiniti	division	on	Nov.	8	--	three	years	after	Honda	pioneered	Japanese	luxury	cars	and	two	months	after	Toyota	's	Lexus	went	on	sale	.
Nissan	started	*-1	advertising	Infiniti	fully	eight	months	before	the	cars	hit	American	showrooms	.
The	ads	featured	fences	,	rocks	and	pussy-willow	buds	--	almost	anything	but	the	cars	themselves	.
The	ads	have	generated	some	laughs	but	also	plenty	of	attention	because	they	are	so	unlike	any	other	U.S.	auto	advertising	.
On	the	other	hand	,	Nissan	's	sales	goals	for	Infiniti	are	modest	compared	with	Toyota	's	targets	for	Lexus	.
Nissan	will	build	only	about	3,500	of	the	$	38,000	*U*	Infiniti	Q45	sedans	each	month	,	*-1	sending	about	2,000	of	them	to	the	U.S.	and	keeping	the	rest	for	sale	in	Japan	.
Toyota	wants	*-1	to	sell	about	49,000	Lexus	LS400	sedans	next	year	in	the	U.S.	alone	.
``	When	I	saw	the	Lexus	sales	projections	*T*-2	,	I	got	worried	,	''	confesses	*T*-1	Takashi	Oka	,	who	*T*-253	led	the	Infiniti	development	team	.
But	on	reflection	,	Mr.	Oka	says	0	*T*-1	,	he	concluded	that	Nissan	is	being	prudent	in	*-2	following	its	slow-startup	strategy	instead	of	simply	copying	Lexus	.
``	Infiniti	is	Nissan	's	big	business	move	for	the	21st	century	,	and	we	're	in	no	hurry	*	to	generate	large	profits	right	away	,	''	Mr.	Oka	says	*T*-1	.
Despite	plans	*	to	add	two	new	Infiniti	models	next	year	,	*	bringing	the	total	to	four	,	Infiniti	wo	n't	show	profits	for	at	least	five	years	,	he	adds	0	*T*-1	.
These	days	Nissan	can	afford	that	strategy	,	even	though	profits	are	n't	exactly	robust	.
Nissan	had	record	net	income	of	114.63	billion	yen	-LRB-	$	868	million	*U*	-RRB-	in	the	fiscal	year	ended	last	March	31	,	a	remarkable	recovery	from	the	20.39	billion	yen	of	two	years	earlier	,	when	the	company	lost	money	on	operations	*T*-1	.
Nissan	has	increased	earnings	more	than	market	share	by	*-1	cutting	costs	and	by	*-1	taking	advantage	of	a	general	surge	in	Japanese	car	sales	.
But	Nissan	expects	*-2	to	earn	only	120	billion	yen	in	the	current	fiscal	year	,	a	modest	increase	of	4.7	%	.
The	big	reason	:	For	all	its	cost-cutting	,	Nissan	remains	less	efficient	than	Toyota	.
In	its	last	fiscal	year	,	Nissan	's	profit	represented	just	2.3	%	of	sales	,	compared	with	4.3	%	at	Toyota	.
*-1	To	help	*-2	close	the	gap	,	Nissan	recently	established	a	top-level	cost-cutting	committee	.
Nissan	is	the	world	's	only	auto	maker	currently	building	vehicles	in	all	three	of	the	world	's	key	economic	arenas	--	the	U.S.	,	Japan	and	Europe	.
That	gives	it	an	enviable	strategic	advantage	,	at	least	until	its	rivals	catch	up	,	but	also	plenty	of	managerial	headaches	.
For	example	,	Nissan	's	U.S.	operations	include	10	separate	subsidiaries	--	for	manufacturing	,	sales	,	design	,	research	,	etc.	--	that	*T*-254	report	separately	back	to	Japan	.
And	in	July	,	Nissan	's	Tennessee	manufacturing	plant	beat	back	a	United	Auto	Workers	organizing	effort	with	aggressive	tactics	that	*T*-255	have	left	some	workers	bitter	.
``	We	are	in	a	transitional	phase	from	*	being	a	Japanese	company	to	*	becoming	an	international	company	based	*	in	Japan	,	''	says	*T*-1	Mr.	Muramatsu	,	the	executive	vice	president	.
He	promises	that	Nissan	will	soon	establish	a	holding	company	overseeing	all	U.S.	operations	,	just	as	it	's	doing	in	Europe	.
Perhaps	the	biggest	challenge	,	however	,	will	be	*	to	prevent	a	return	to	its	former	corporate	rigidity	as	its	recovery	continues	.
Already	,	personnel	officials	are	talking	about	the	need	for	a	``	Phase	Two	''	cultural-reform	effort	of	some	sort	.
``	We	are	still	only	half	way	through	the	turnaround	of	this	company	,	and	there	are	many	more	things	0	*	to	do	*T*-2	,	''	President	Kume	says	*T*-1	.
He	adds	,	however	,	that	``	the	momentum	0	we	have	generated	*T*-1	is	unstoppable	.
As	*	expected	,	Warner	Bros	.	Records	said	0	it	agreed	*-1	to	form	a	recorded-music	and	music-publishing	joint	venture	with	former	MCA	Records	Chairman	Irving	Azoff	.
Warner	said	0	it	will	provide	financing	for	the	venture	,	but	did	n't	disclose	terms	.
Mr.	Azoff	has	n't	named	the	company	yet	,	but	any	records	0	it	produces	*T*-1	will	be	distributed	*-221	by	Warner	.
Warner	is	part	of	Warner	Communications	Inc.	,	which	*T*-256	is	in	the	process	of	*	being	acquired	*-222	by	Time	Warner	Inc	.
Mr.	Azoff	resigned	as	head	of	MCA	Records	,	a	unit	of	MCA	Inc.	,	in	September	,	and	*-1	had	been	discussing	a	joint	venture	with	both	Warner	and	MCA	.
In	a	statement	yesterday	,	Mr.	Azoff	said	0	he	chose	Warner	,	the	largest	record	company	,	because	``	their	standing	in	the	entertainment	industry	is	second	to	none	.
President	Bush	and	Soviet	leader	Mikhail	Gorbachev	will	hold	an	informal	meeting	in	early	December	,	a	move	that	*T*-257	should	give	both	leaders	a	political	boost	at	home	.
The	White	House	is	purposely	not	calling	the	meeting	a	summit	so	that	there	wo	n't	be	any	expectation	of	detailed	negotiations	or	agreements	.
Rather	,	senior	administration	officials	said	that	the	unexpected	meeting	was	scheduled	*-223	at	Mr.	Bush	's	request	because	of	his	preference	for	*	conducting	diplomacy	through	highly	personal	and	informal	meetings	with	other	leaders	.
The	two	leaders	will	meet	on	Dec.	2	and	3	,	*	alternating	the	two	days	of	meetings	between	a	U.S.	*RNR*-1	and	a	Soviet	*RNR*-1	naval	vessel	in	the	Mediterranean	Sea	.
The	unusual	seaborne	meeting	wo	n't	disrupt	plans	for	a	formal	summit	meeting	next	spring	or	summer	,	at	which	an	arms-control	treaty	is	likely	*-2	to	be	completed	*-224	*T*-1	.
In	*	announcing	the	meeting	yesterday	,	Mr.	Bush	told	reporters	at	the	White	House	that	neither	he	nor	Mr.	Gorbachev	expects	any	``	substantial	decisions	or	agreements	.	''
Instead	,	he	said	that	the	purpose	is	simply	for	the	two	to	get	``	better	acquainted	''	and	discuss	a	wide	range	of	issues	without	a	formal	agenda	.
Despite	the	informal	nature	of	the	session	and	the	calculated	effort	*	to	hold	down	expectations	,	the	meeting	could	pay	significant	political	dividends	for	both	leaders	.
Mr.	Gorbachev	badly	needs	a	diversion	from	the	serious	economic	problems	and	ethnic	unrest	0	he	faces	*T*-1	at	home	.
American	officials	have	said	that	a	meeting	with	the	leader	of	the	U.S.	could	help	*-1	bolster	his	stature	among	Soviet	politicians	and	academics	,	whose	support	he	needs	*T*-258	.
For	his	part	,	Mr.	Bush	has	been	criticized	*-225	regularly	at	home	for	*-1	moving	too	slowly	and	cautiously	in	*-2	reacting	to	Mr.	Gorbachev	's	reforms	and	the	historic	moves	away	from	communism	in	Eastern	Europe	.
A	face-to-face	meeting	with	Mr.	Gorbachev	should	damp	such	criticism	,	though	it	will	hardly	eliminate	it	.
Senate	Majority	Leader	George	Mitchell	-LRB-	D.	,	Maine	-RRB-	,	who	*T*-259	has	been	the	most	prominent	Democratic	critic	of	Mr.	Bush	's	handling	of	the	Soviet	relationship	,	praised	the	president	for	*-1	arranging	the	meeting	.
But	he	added	:	``	The	mere	fact	of	a	meeting	does	n't	deal	with	the	substance	of	policy	.	''
Mr.	Bush	said	that	the	December	meeting	,	which	*T*-1	was	announced	*-227	simultaneously	in	Moscow	,	will	be	held	*-226	in	the	unusual	setting	of	ships	at	sea	*	to	hold	down	the	``	fanfare	''	and	force	the	two	sides	to	limit	participation	to	just	small	groups	of	advisers	.
``	By	*-2	doing	it	in	this	manner	we	can	have	,	I	would	say	,	more	time	without	the	press	of	social	activities	or	mandatory	joint	appearances	,	things	of	that	nature	for	public	consumption	,	''	Mr.	Bush	said	*T*-1	.
Soviet	Foreign	Minister	Eduard	Shevardnadze	,	at	a	news	conference	in	Moscow	,	said	,	``	As	the	two	sides	plan	*-2	to	hold	a	full-scale	summit	in	late	spring-early	summer	next	year	,	they	found	it	*EXP*-1	useful	,	I	would	say	even	necessary	,	*	to	hold	an	interim	informal	meeting	.	''
Although	no	specific	agreements	are	expected	*-228	,	Mr.	Shevardnadze	said	``	that	does	n't	mean	0	they	will	be	without	an	agenda	.	''
If	the	two	leaders	cover	the	subjects	that	*T*-1	have	been	featured	*-229	in	lower	level	U.S.-Soviet	meetings	,	their	talks	would	include	human	rights	,	Soviet	reforms	,	regional	disputes	,	relations	with	allies	,	economic	cooperation	,	arms	control	,	and	joint	efforts	*	to	fight	narcotics	,	terrorism	and	pollution	.
The	president	specifically	mentioned	U.S.	economic	advice	to	Moscow	as	a	possible	topic	.
Mr.	Gorbachev	has	for	months	been	publicly	urging	the	U.S.	*-1	to	drop	its	restrictions	on	Soviet	trade	.
He	recently	told	a	small	group	of	American	businessmen	in	Moscow	that	he	hoped	*-2	to	sign	a	general	trade	agreement	with	the	U.S.	,	possibly	at	the	1990	summit	.
The	Soviets	hope	0	a	trade	agreement	would	give	them	Most-Favored	Nation	status	,	which	*T*-260	would	lower	the	tariffs	on	Soviet	exports	to	the	U.S.	.
In	an	unusually	candid	article	about	the	latest	economic	woe	--	unemployment	--	Pravda	yesterday	reported	that	three	million	Soviets	have	lost	their	jobs	as	a	result	of	perestroika	and	the	number	could	grow	to	16	million	by	the	year	2005	.
Economists	in	Moscow	are	now	proposing	that	the	state	start	a	system	of	unemployment	benefits	.
But	one	Bush	administration	official	knowledgeable	about	the	summit	plan	cautioned	against	*	assuming	that	there	will	be	bold	new	initiatives	on	the	Soviet	economy	or	other	issues	.
``	*	Do	n't	take	this	as	some	big	opening	for	major	movement	on	economic	cooperation	,	or	arms	control	,	or	the	environment	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
``	Those	things	will	all	come	up	,	but	in	a	fairly	informal	way	.	''
Instead	,	this	official	said	,	``	This	is	vintage	George	Bush	.
This	was	George	Bush	's	own	idea	.
It	's	George	Bush	wanting	*-2	to	meet	a	foreign	leader	and	talk	to	him	directly	.	''
Aside	from	the	Soviet	economic	plight	and	talks	on	*	cutting	strategic	and	chemical	arms	,	one	other	issue	0	the	Soviets	are	likely	*-2	to	want	*-3	to	raise	*T*-1	is	naval	force	reductions	.
Western	analysts	say	that	,	given	the	meeting	's	setting	at	sea	,	Gorbachev	is	unlikely	*-1	to	pass	up	the	opportunity	*	to	press	once	again	for	negotiated	cuts	in	the	navies	of	both	the	North	Atlantic	Treaty	Organization	and	the	Warsaw	Pact	.
That	theme	has	been	a	recurring	one	for	Soviet	military	officials	for	much	of	this	year	.
They	argue	that	as	the	Kremlin	follows	through	on	announced	plans	*	to	cut	land	forces	--	the	Soviets	'	area	of	greatest	strength	--	the	U.S.	should	show	more	willingness	*	to	cut	sea	forces	--	Washington	's	area	of	greatest	superiority	.
One	of	the	reasons	0	Bush	administration	aides	are	anxious	*-2	to	insist	that	the	coming	meeting	will	be	informal	*T*-1	is	*	to	avoid	comparisons	with	the	last	such	loosely	structured	superpower	gathering	,	former	President	Reagan	's	1986	meeting	with	Mr.	Gorbachev	in	Reykjavik	,	Iceland	.
That	meeting	sent	shivers	through	the	Western	alliance	because	Mr.	Reagan	was	pulled	*-230	into	*	discussing	the	possible	elimination	of	nuclear	weapons	without	*-1	consulting	American	allies	.
Mr.	Bush	said	that	he	initiated	talks	with	the	Soviets	on	the	informal	meeting	by	*-3	sending	a	proposal	*ICH*-2	to	Mr.	Gorbachev	last	July	,	which	the	Soviet	leader	readily	accepted	*T*-1	.
But	word	of	the	possible	session	was	closely	held	*-1	by	the	president	and	a	handful	of	top	aides	,	and	word	of	it	did	n't	reach	many	second-level	officials	until	the	past	few	days	.
Indeed	,	many	senior	officials	had	been	insisting	for	weeks	that	Mr.	Bush	was	n't	interested	in	such	an	informal	get-together	.
Though	President	Bush	's	political	critics	at	home	have	been	urging	him	*-1	to	open	a	more	direct	dialogue	with	Mr.	Gorbachev	,	it	actually	was	the	arguments	of	leaders	within	the	Soviet	bloc	itself	that	*T*-261	led	the	president	to	seek	the	December	meeting	.
Mr.	Bush	decided	0	he	wanted	the	meeting	after	*-3	talking	in	Europe	in	July	with	the	leaders	of	Poland	and	Hungary	,	who	*T*-262	urged	him	*-1	to	support	Mr.	Gorbachev	's	efforts	*	to	transform	the	Soviet	system	and	to	urge	him	*-4	to	loosen	his	grip	on	Eastern	Europe	,	a	senior	aide	said	0	*T*-2	.
While	*-1	flying	home	from	those	discussions	,	Mr.	Bush	drafted	a	letter	to	Mr.	Gorbachev	suggesting	an	informal	get-together	0	*T*-2	to	precede	their	formal	summit	next	year	.
Peter	Gumbel	in	Moscow	contributed	to	this	article	.
Banca	Nazionale	del	Lavoro	said	0	its	potential	losses	from	*	lending	to	Iraq	could	reach	1.175	trillion	lire	-LRB-	$	872	million	*U*	-RRB-	,	*-1	marking	the	bank	's	first	quantification	of	potential	costs	of	unauthorized	lending	by	its	Atlanta	branch	.
BNL	previously	reported	that	its	Georgia	branch	had	taken	on	loan	commitments	topping	$	3	billion	*U*	without	the	Rome-based	management	's	approval	.
State-owned	BNL	,	Italy	's	largest	bank	,	has	filed	charges	against	the	branch	's	former	manager	,	Christopher	Drogoul	,	and	a	former	branch	vice	president	,	alleging	fraud	and	breach	of	their	fiduciary	duties	.
BNL	also	said	that	its	board	had	approved	``	after	an	in-depth	discussion	,	''	a	letter	to	the	Bank	of	Italy	outlining	measures	0	the	state-owned	bank	has	taken	*T*-2	or	plans	*-3	to	take	*T*-2	*-3	to	improve	controls	on	its	foreign	branches	.
The	central	bank	had	ordered	BNL	*-1	to	come	up	with	a	suitable	program	by	yesterday	.
Bank	of	Italy	has	also	ordered	BNL	*-1	to	shore	up	its	capital	base	*	to	account	for	potential	foreign	loan	losses	,	and	the	Rome	bank	has	outlined	a	3	trillion	lire	capital-raising	operation	.
BNL	was	unable	*-1	to	elaborate	on	what	measures	*T*-2	were	planned	*-231	by	the	bank	*	to	improve	controls	on	its	branches	abroad	.
Hardly	a	day	passes	without	news	photos	of	the	police	dragging	limp	protesters	from	some	building	or	thoroughfare	in	one	of	our	cities	.
Of	recent	note	are	*T*-1	the	activities	of	the	pro-	and	anti-abortionists	,	anti-nuclear	activists	,	animal	rights	protesters	,	college	students	concerned	about	racism	,	anti-apartheid	groups	,	various	self-styled	``	environmentalists	''	and	those	dissatisfied	with	the	pace	of	the	war	against	AIDS	.
Maybe	he	did	n't	start	it	,	but	Mohandas	Gandhi	certainly	provided	a	recognizable	beginning	to	non-violent	civil	disobedience	as	we	know	it	today	.
The	Mahatma	,	or	``	great	souled	one	,	''	instigated	several	campaigns	of	passive	resistance	against	the	British	government	in	India	.
Unfortunately	,	according	to	Webster	's	Biographical	Dictionary	,	``	His	policies	went	beyond	his	control	and	resulted	...	in	riots	and	disturbances	''	and	later	a	renewed	campaign	of	civil	disobedience	``	resulted	in	rioting	and	a	second	imprisonment	.	''
I	am	not	a	proponent	of	everything	0	Gandhi	did	*T*-1	,	but	some	of	his	law	breaking	was	justified	because	India	was	then	under	occupation	by	a	foreign	power	,	and	Indians	were	not	able	*-2	to	participate	fully	in	decisions	that	*T*-263	vitally	affected	them	.
It	*EXP*-1	is	difficult	,	however	,	*	to	justify	civil	disobedience	,	non-violent	or	not	,	where	citizens	have	full	recourse	to	the	ballot	box	*-3	to	effect	change	*T*-2	.
Where	truly	representative	governments	are	safeguarded	*-232	by	constitutional	protections	of	human	rights	and	an	independent	judiciary	0	*T*-2	to	construe	those	rights	*T*-1	,	there	is	no	excuse	for	*	breaking	the	law	because	some	individual	or	group	disagrees	with	it	.
There	may	be	a	few	cases	where	the	law	breaking	is	well	pinpointed	and	so	completely	non-invasive	of	the	rights	of	others	that	it	*EXP*-2	is	difficult	*	to	criticize	it	*T*-1	.
The	case	of	Rosa	Parks	,	the	black	woman	who	*T*-264	refused	*-1	to	sit	at	the	back	of	the	bus	,	comes	to	mind	as	an	illustration	.
But	most	cases	of	non-violent	civil	disobedience	are	not	nearly	so	benign	.
The	public	has	a	tendency	*	to	equate	lawful	demonstrations	with	non-violent	civil	disobedience	.
It	*EXP*-1	is	true	that	both	are	non-violent	,	but	there	is	a	fundamental	difference	between	them	.
Lawful	demonstrations	,	such	as	peaceful	picketing	and	other	assemblages	that	*T*-265	do	not	disturb	the	peace	or	cause	a	public	nuisance	or	interfere	with	the	rights	of	others	,	are	rights	guaranteed	*	by	any	truly	free	system	of	government	.
Civil	disobedience	,	violent	or	non-violent	,	is	intentional	law	breaking	.
The	subject	of	this	discussion	is	non-violent	civil	disobedience	;	but	,	before	we	get	on	with	that	,	*	let	me	make	just	a	few	tangential	remarks	about	lawful	demonstrations	.
They	are	useful	*-1	to	call	public	attention	to	grievances	,	but	they	have	little	value	in	*	educating	anyone	about	the	issues	in	dispute	.
The	delight	of	television	in	dramatic	confrontation	encourages	overuse	of	slogans	chanted	*	through	bullhorns	,	militant	gestures	,	accusatory	signs	and	other	emotionally	inspired	tactics	.
Civilized	discourse	and	an	environment	where	compromise	can	begin	*T*-1	are	lost	*-233	in	a	hostile	posture	abetted	*	by	superficial	media	interviews	.
At	best	,	demonstrations	are	overused	and	boringly	uninformative	;	at	worst	,	they	can	become	the	stimuli	that	*T*-266	lead	to	law	breaking	.
Demonstrations	are	particularly	apt	*-2	to	degenerate	into	criminal	conduct	when	they	leave	the	site	of	the	grievance	and	become	mobile	*T*-1	.
Petty	criminals	and	street	people	looking	for	excitement	attach	themselves	like	remora	to	the	fringes	of	the	crowd	and	use	the	protest	as	an	excuse	for	rock	throwing	,	auto	trashing	,	arson	,	window	breaking	,	looting	,	pocket	picking	and	general	hooliganism	.
Soon	the	whole	purpose	of	the	demonstration	is	lost	*-234	in	mob	mania	.
There	are	better	ways	0	*	to	promote	a	cause	*T*-1	.
Where	non-violent	civil	disobedience	*ICH*-3	is	the	centerpiece	,	rather	than	a	lawful	demonstration	that	*T*-267	may	only	attract	crime	*T*-2	,	it	is	difficult	0	*	to	justify	*T*-1	.
Some	find	no	harm	in	the	misdemeanors	of	trespass	,	minor	property	destruction	,	*	blocking	traffic	and	the	like	.
They	say	0	these	are	small	prices	0	*	to	pay	*T*-1	for	*	galvanizing	action	for	the	all-important	cause	.
The	crimes	may	appear	small	,	but	the	prices	can	be	huge	.
Here	are	*T*-1	two	cases	0	*T*-2	to	illustrate	.
*	Assume	a	neighborhood	demonstration	0	*T*-1	to	protest	speeding	on	a	certain	road	or	a	careless	accident	involving	a	police	car	.
The	protesters	lie	down	in	the	street	,	*	blocking	traffic	,	and	will	not	move	until	the	authorities	carry	them	away	.
*	Assume	that	someone	caught	*	in	the	jam	has	a	heart	attack	.
There	is	no	way	0	*	to	get	an	ambulance	in	quickly	*	to	move	him	to	a	hospital	*T*-1	.
He	dies	.
The	demonstration	was	non-violent	and	involved	only	a	simple	misdemeanor	,	but	its	impact	on	that	individual	was	violent	and	terminal	.
*	Assume	that	a	TV	network	is	airing	a	celebrity	interview	program	with	a	live	audience	.
The	politician	appearing	is	highly	controversial	and	has	recently	generated	a	good	deal	of	rancor	amid	certain	groups	.
In	a	planned	protest	against	his	appearance	,	several	members	of	the	studio	audience	chain	themselves	in	front	of	the	TV	cameras	in	such	a	way	that	the	program	can	not	continue	.
The	network	must	refund	money	to	the	advertisers	and	loses	considerable	revenue	and	prestige	.
The	demonstrators	have	been	non-violent	,	but	the	result	of	their	trespasses	has	been	*-1	to	seriously	impair	the	rights	of	others	unconnected	with	their	dispute	.
It	might	be	alleged	that	TV	has	done	more	than	its	share	*	to	popularize	and	promote	non-violent	civil	disobedience	,	so	the	second	situation	hypothesized	*	above	would	be	simply	a	case	of	``	chickens	coming	home	*	to	roost	.	''
Or	maybe	the	TV	network	would	lose	nothing	.
Geraldo	or	Phil	would	probably	pull	up	another	camera	and	interview	the	chained	protesters	.
*	Let	us	look	for	a	moment	at	another	type	of	non-violent	civil	disobedience	that	*T*-268	only	harms	other	people	indirectly	,	yet	does	irreparable	damage	to	the	nation	as	a	whole	.
I	am	referring	to	those	young	men	who	*T*-269	chose	*-1	to	disobey	their	country	's	call	to	arms	during	the	Vietnam	war	and	fled	to	Canada	or	some	other	sanctuary	*-1	to	avoid	combat	.
Their	cowardly	acts	of	civil	disobedience	,	which	they	tried	*-1	to	hide	*T*-2	under	the	cloak	of	outrage	at	a	war	0	they	characterized	*T*-3	as	``	immoral	,	''	weakened	the	national	fabric	and	threw	additional	burdens	on	those	who	*T*-270	served	honorably	in	that	conflict	.
Even	more	at	fault	are	*T*-1	those	leaders	in	*RNR*-3	and	out	of	*RNR*-3	government	who	*T*-271	urged	and	supported	their	defections	,	*-2	thereby	giving	great	help	and	comfort	to	the	enemy	propagandists	.
It	*EXP*-3	is	amazing	that	the	ensuing	mass	executions	in	Vietnam	and	Cambodia	do	not	weight	more	heavily	on	minds	so	morally	fine-tuned	.
Worse	,	it	*EXP*-4	remained	to	a	well-meaning	but	naive	president	of	the	United	States	*	to	administer	the	final	infamy	upon	those	who	*T*-272	fought	and	died	in	Vietnam	.
Under	the	guise	of	``	*	healing	the	wounds	of	the	nation	,	''	President	Carter	pardoned	thousands	of	draft	evaders	,	thus	*-1	giving	dignity	to	their	allegations	of	the	war	's	``	immorality	.	''
The	precedent	having	been	set	*-1	,	who	*T*-273	can	complain	if	future	generations	called	upon	*	*	to	defend	the	U.S.	yield	to	the	temptation	*	to	avoid	the	danger	of	combat	by	*-2	simply	declaring	the	war	immoral	and	hiding	until	it	is	over	?
Finally	,	I	think	0	it	*EXP*-1	important	*	to	point	out	the	extraordinarily	high	visibility	of	non-violent	civil	disobedience	in	these	days	of	intensive	media	coverage	.
*	Give	television	a	chance	*	to	cover	live	any	breaking	of	the	law	,	and	no	second	invitation	will	be	required	*-237	.
This	brings	into	question	the	motives	of	those	who	*T*-274	lead	civil	disobedience	demonstrations	.
Do	they	want	the	spotlight	for	themselves	or	for	their	cause	?
Here	is	*T*-1	a	good	rule	of	thumb	:	If	the	movement	produced	the	leader	,	the	chance	that	he	is	sincere	is	much	greater	than	if	the	leader	produced	the	movement	.
In	either	case	,	*	ask	yourself	whether	you	have	become	better	informed	on	the	issues	under	protest	by	*-1	watching	the	act	of	civil	disobedience	.
If	you	have	not	*?*	,	it	*EXP*-5	is	probable	that	a	thorough	airing	of	the	dispute	by	calm	and	rational	debate	would	have	been	the	better	course	.

Gov.	George	Deukmejian	and	key	legislators	agreed	*-1	to	back	a	temporary	one-quarter-cent	increase	in	the	state	sales	tax	*-2	to	raise	$	800	million	*U*	for	repairs	and	relief	associated	*	with	last	month	's	earthquake	.
The	tax	increase	,	which	*T*-1	will	be	considered	*-238	at	a	special	session	of	the	state	legislature	that	*T*-275	begins	tomorrow	,	would	cover	only	part	of	the	estimated	$	4	billion	to	$	6	billion	*U*	in	total	damage	caused	*	by	the	Oct.	17	quake	.
Aside	from	as	much	as	$	3.45	billion	*U*	in	recently	approved	federal	aid	,	the	state	is	expected	*-1	to	draw	from	a	gubernatorial	emergency	fund	that	*T*-276	currently	stands	at	an	estimated	$	700	million	*U*	.
``	I	am	not	aware	that	there	is	anything	but	bipartisan	agreement	for	the	general	outline	''	of	the	revenue-raising	plan	,	said	0	*T*-1	a	spokesman	for	the	governor	,	after	a	Monday	meeting	with	legislative	leaders	over	the	quake-relief	question	.
The	tax	increase	--	on	top	of	the	current	six-cent	per	dollar	sales	tax	--	would	become	effective	this	Dec.	1	and	expire	Dec.	31	,	1990	.
The	sales-tax	plan	was	preferred	*-239	over	an	alternative	that	*T*-277	would	have	boosted	the	state	gasoline	tax	.
Some	legislators	expressed	concern	that	a	gas-tax	increase	would	take	too	long	and	possibly	damage	chances	of	a	major	gas-tax-increasing	ballot	initiative	that	voters	will	consider	*T*-278	next	June	.
Despite	continuing	problems	in	its	newsprint	business	,	Kimberly-Clark	Corp.	posted	a	20	%	gain	in	third-quarter	net	income	.
The	consumer-products	and	newsprint	company	said	0	net	rose	to	$	108.8	million	*U*	,	or	$	1.35	*U*	a	share	,	from	$	90.5	million	*U*	,	or	$	1.12	*U*	a	share	,	a	year	ago	.
Sales	rose	6.2	%	to	$	1.45	billion	*U*	from	$	1.37	billion	*U*	.
After	a	flat	second	quarter	tied	*	largely	to	lower	newsprint	earnings	,	Kimberly-Clark	attributed	the	gain	to	improved	results	in	its	consumer	businesses	in	North	America	,	Brazil	and	Korea	.
Those	gains	came	from	higher	prices	,	particularly	for	disposable	diapers	and	tissue	products	,	and	from	increased	sales	,	primarily	for	feminine-care	products	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-1	.
Newsprint	results	continued	*-1	to	be	depressed	,	the	company	added	0	*T*-2	,	because	of	industrywide	price	discounting	.
The	quarter-to-quarter	comparison	was	also	enhanced	*-1	by	charges	taken	*	in	the	year-earlier	period	,	including	$	11	million	*U*	related	to	the	modernization	of	a	pulp	and	newsprint	mill	in	Alabama	.
In	the	1989	period	also	,	interest	expense	and	tax	rates	were	lower	than	a	year	ago	.
In	the	first	nine	months	,	profit	rose	10	%	to	$	313.2	million	*U*	,	or	$	3.89	*U*	a	share	,	from	$	283.9	million	*U*	,	or	$	3.53	*U*	a	share	.
Sales	rose	6.7	%	to	$	4.27	billion	*U*	from	$	4	billion	*U*	.
In	New	York	Stock	Exchange	composite	trading	,	Kimberly-Clark	closed	at	$	66.50	*U*	a	share	,	up	$	1.50	*U*	.
INTENSIVE	AUDITS	are	coming	to	55,500	taxpayers	as	research	guinea	pigs	.
This	is	the	year	:	Unsuspecting	filers	of	1988	personal	returns	are	being	picked	randomly	for	thorough	audits	*	to	help	the	IRS	update	its	criteria	for	enforcement	,	audit	selection	,	and	use	of	resources	.
The	last	Taxpayer	Compliance	Measurement	Program	survey	covered	1985	returns	.
The	1988-return	project	starts	Jan.	1	and	is	*-1	to	be	done	*-240	by	May	31	,	1991	.
Specially	trained	IRS	agents	will	look	for	under-reported	income	and	unsupported	deductions	and	credits	.
The	agents	will	make	more	than	routine	inquiries	about	such	items	as	marital	status	and	dependents	;	they	want	*-1	to	look	at	living	standards	and	business	assets	.
But	they	also	are	*-1	to	see	that	taxpayers	get	all	allowable	tax	benefits	and	to	ask	if	filers	who	*T*-279	sought	IRS	aid	were	satisfied	with	it	.
Courts	have	ruled	that	taxpayers	must	submit	to	TCMP	audits	,	but	the	IRS	will	excuse	from	the	fullscale	rigors	anyone	who	*T*-1	was	audited	*-241	without	change	for	either	1986	or	1987	.
Rewards	have	been	suggested	*-2	--	but	never	adopted	*-2	--	for	filers	who	*T*-280	come	through	TCMP	audits	without	change	.
PENALTY	OVERHAUL	is	still	likely	,	congressional	sources	say	0	*T*-1	.
Long-debated	proposals	*	to	simplify	the	more	than	150	civil	penalties	and	make	them	fairer	and	easier	0	*	to	administer	*T*-1	are	in	the	House	tax	bill	.
But	they	were	stripped	*-242	from	the	Senate	bill	after	staffers	estimated	0	penalty	revenue	would	fall	by	$	216	million	*U*	over	five	years	.
Still	,	congressional	aides	say	0	penalty	reform	is	a	strong	candidate	for	enactment	,	even	if	not	this	time	around	,	although	some	provisions	may	be	modified	*-243	.
Sen.	Pryor	-LRB-	D.	,	Ark.	-RRB-	,	a	leader	on	the	issue	who	*T*-281	generally	backs	the	House	plan	,	wants	some	changes	--	for	one	,	separate	sanctions	for	negligence	and	large	misstatements	of	tax	owed	*	,	not	a	single	penalty	.
He	would	ease	the	proposed	penalties	for	delayed	payroll-tax	deposits	and	for	faulty	Form	1099	and	other	reports	that	taxpayers	correct	voluntarily	*T*-282	.
The	General	Accounting	Office	urges	Congress	*-1	to	ensure	that	all	penalties	retain	their	force	as	deterrents	.
TAXPAYERS	'	RIGHTS	are	defined	*-244	by	a	growing	number	of	states	.
The	1988	tax	act	created	a	federal	bill	of	rights	spelling	out	IRS	duties	*	to	protect	taxpayers	'	rights	in	the	assessment	and	collection	of	taxes	.
States	are	following	suit	.
California	enacted	a	rights	law	in	1988	.
In	1989	,	Illinois	,	Kansas	,	Ohio	,	Oregon	and	South	Carolina	have	adopted	rights	laws	,	the	Federation	of	Tax	Administrators	,	a	state	officials	'	group	,	reports	0	*T*-1	;	the	features	vary	.
And	taxpayer	groups	are	urging	legislation	in	many	other	states	.
One	group	is	the	Committee	on	State	Taxation	,	which	*T*-283	comprises	330	multistate	corporations	and	advises	the	Council	of	State	Chambers	of	Commerce	.
The	group	's	Mark	Cahoon	says	0	its	efforts	begun	*	in	1989	have	led	to	the	introduction	of	bills	*ICH*-3	*PPA*-1	in	Massachusetts	,	Minnesota	and	Colorado	0	*T*-2	to	establish	evenhanded	procedures	affecting	all	kinds	of	taxpayers	.
The	group	also	seeks	uniformity	among	states	in	provisions	for	taxpayers	'	rights	.
This	week	,	New	York	City	announced	a	10-point	policy	patterned	*	on	the	federal	bill	of	rights	for	taxpayers	.
THE	MILEAGE	RATE	allowed	*	for	business	use	of	a	car	in	1989	has	risen	to	25.5	cents	a	mile	for	the	first	15,000	from	24	cents	in	1988	,	the	IRS	says	0	*T*-1	;	the	rate	stays	11	cents	for	each	added	mile	.
Also	unaltered	:	12	cents	for	charitable	activities	and	nine	cents	for	medical	and	moving	costs	.
IRA	BALANCES	could	be	used	*-1	*-1	to	qualify	for	bank	services	under	a	bill	entered	*	by	Reps.	Chandler	-LRB-	R.	,	Wash	.	-RRB-	and	Andrews	-LRB-	D.	,	Texas	-RRB-	.
The	bill	would	thwart	a	recent	Labor	Department	opinion	that	*	investing	individual-retirement-account	funds	*	to	earn	free	checking	violates	the	law	.
HUGO	FELLED	vast	timberlands	.
South	Carolina	's	congressional	delegation	has	entered	Senate	and	House	bills	0	*T*-1	to	provide	special	casualty-loss	treatment	and	other	tax	relief	for	timber	growers	in	the	hurricane	disaster	areas	.
HE	RODE	HIS	HOBBY	,	but	he	could	n't	milk	it	,	the	Tax	Court	says	0	*T*-1	.
The	court	often	weighs	deductions	of	sideline-business	costs	:	Do	they	stem	from	a	profit-seeking	activity	or	a	nondeductible	hobby	?
But	it	*EXP*-4	's	rare	*	to	see	both	functions	in	one	case	.
Charles	O.	Givens	of	Mount	Vernon	,	Ind.	-	investment	broker	,	ex-accountant	,	and	son	of	a	former	stable	owner	-	bred	Tennessee	Walking	Horses	for	six	years	,	raised	cattle	for	four	,	and	never	made	a	profit	on	either	.
He	claimed	losses	totaling	$	42,455	*U*	--	and	the	IRS	denied	them	all	.
Special	Judge	Galloway	noted	that	Givens	managed	horse-breeding	in	a	businesslike	way	:	He	kept	detailed	accounts	,	practiced	soil	conservation	,	enhanced	his	experience	by	*-1	consulting	experts	,	spent	several	hours	a	day	*-1	doing	chores	,	and	dropped	the	sideline	when	his	best	brood	mare	died	*T*-2	.
Yet	he	took	little	businesslike	care	with	his	cattle	:	He	had	no	prior	experience	and	did	n't	seek	business	counsel	about	them	.
The	judge	said	0	Givens	may	deduct	his	$	30,180	*U*	of	losses	from	horse	breeding	,	but	rejected	the	$	12,275	*U*	in	deductions	from	the	cattle	operation	.
BRIEFS	:
The	IRS	already	is	doing	intensive	TCMP	audits	of	19,000	returns	for	1987	and	fiscal	1988	filed	*	by	corporations	with	under	$	10	million	*U*	in	assets	...	.
President	Bush	says	0	he	will	name	Donald	E.	Kirkendall	to	the	new	Treasury	post	of	inspector	general	,	which	*T*-284	has	responsibilities	for	the	IRS	...	.
The	U.S.	and	Finland	signed	an	income-tax	treaty	,	subject	to	ratification	.
An	arbitrator	awarded	Eastern	Airlines	pilots	between	$	60	million	and	$	100	million	*U*	in	back	pay	,	a	decision	that	*T*-285	could	complicate	the	carrier	's	bankruptcy-law	reorganization	.
Eastern	,	a	unit	of	Texas	Air	Corp.	,	said	0	it	is	examining	the	ruling	*-1	to	determine	if	it	can	appeal	.
It	*EXP*-1	's	unclear	whether	Eastern	will	succeed	in	*-2	overturning	the	arbitrator	's	decision	,	made	*	in	a	long-simmering	``	pay	parity	''	dispute	that	*T*-286	predates	both	the	carrier	's	Chapter	11	petition	and	its	1986	acquisition	by	Texas	Air	.
All	Eastern	's	previous	court	efforts	*	to	head	off	the	pilots	'	demands	have	failed	.
An	Eastern	spokesman	said	0	he	does	n't	expect	that	the	arbitrator	's	ruling	``	will	have	any	overall	material	effect	on	the	company	's	strategic	plan	.	''
Bankruptcy	experts	said	0	the	law	is	n't	clear	on	how	such	an	arbitration	ruling	can	affect	a	company	's	case	*T*-1	.
Like	any	other	creditor	,	the	pilots	will	have	*-1	to	apply	to	the	court	for	payment	of	their	claim	.
That	may	leave	a	lot	of	leeway	0	for	U.S.	Bankruptcy	Judge	Burton	R.	Lifland	to	decide	what	,	if	anything	,	the	pilots	actually	collect	*T*-287	*T*-1	.
In	August	,	he	issued	the	ruling	that	*T*-288	let	the	pilots	pursue	their	back-pay	grievance	before	the	arbitrator	.
The	pilots	'	contract	with	Eastern	calls	for	a	mutually	acceptable	private	arbitrator	to	resolve	such	grievances	.
In	a	statement	to	employees	,	Eastern	said	0	the	company	was	disappointed	by	the	ruling	.
``	The	obligation	is	totally	unwarranted	,	''	the	statement	said	*T*-1	.
James	Linsey	,	a	lawyer	for	the	Air	Line	Pilots	Association	,	said	0	the	pilots	were	extremely	pleased	.
``	This	is	a	blow	not	only	to	Eastern	but	to	the	creditors	committee	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
Eastern	's	creditors	committee	,	along	with	the	company	,	has	consistently	opposed	the	pilots	'	claim	,	which	if	*-2	paid	*-5	*T*-1	would	have	*-2	to	come	out	of	money	0	both	hope	*-6	to	use	*T*-3	*-4	to	pay	off	other	bankruptcy	claims	.
Eastern	and	its	creditors	are	in	the	final	,	delicate	stages	of	*	negotiating	a	second	reorganization	plan	*	to	pay	off	the	airline	's	debts	.
An	earlier	plan	,	which	*T*-289	had	received	the	creditors	'	approval	in	July	,	fell	apart	when	Eastern	changed	its	business	plan	*T*-1	.
It	is	n't	known	whether	the	pilot	claim	was	figured	*-245	into	either	plan	.
The	dispute	between	Eastern	and	its	pilots	is	over	a	``	pay	parity	''	clause	in	the	pilots	'	contract	.
The	clause	was	part	of	an	agreement	in	which	pilots	accepted	a	substantial	pay	cut	as	long	as	no	other	labor	group	got	a	raise	*T*-1	.
Shortly	after	Texas	Air	took	control	of	Eastern	,	some	Machinists	union	supervisors	received	a	20	%	pay	raise	.
The	pilots	argued	that	this	triggered	a	pay	raise	for	them	.
Eastern	has	disputed	the	claim	,	but	a	federal	district	court	,	an	appeals	court	and	now	the	arbitrator	have	all	sided	with	the	pilots	.
The	two	sides	do	n't	even	agree	about	how	much	money	*T*-1	is	at	issue	.
The	pilots	put	the	amount	as	high	as	$	100	million	*U*	,	the	company	at	$	65	million	*U*	.
Another	arbitrator	is	hearing	another	pay	parity	case	between	Eastern	and	its	pilots	,	resulting	from	a	similar	set	of	circumstances	involving	a	separate	pay	raise	granted	*	another	union	.
A	decision	on	that	case	is	n't	expected	*-1	before	mid-November	.
Ironically	,	many	of	the	pilots	involved	*	have	left	Eastern	or	are	still	striking	the	carrier	,	which	*T*-290	filed	for	bankruptcy	protection	March	9	.
About	800	have	crossed	the	picket	lines	and	returned	to	work	.
Few	people	in	the	advertising	business	have	raised	as	many	hackles	as	Alvin	A.	Achenbaum	.
The	general	public	may	not	know	his	name	,	but	he	's	famous	--	*	make	that	infamous	--	in	advertising	circles	:	*-1	A	marketing	consultant	,	he	pioneered	*-1	slashing	ad	agency	commissions	,	to	the	delight	of	advertising	clients	and	the	dismay	of	agencies	.
Now	,	after	*-1	beating	them	,	Mr.	Achenbaum	is	joining	them	.
Backer	Spielvogel	Bates	Worldwide	named	Mr.	Achenbaum	,	62	,	vice	chairman	of	professional	services	,	reporting	directly	to	Carl	Spielvogel	,	chairman	and	chief	executive	officer	.
He	joins	Nov.	13	,	*-1	dissolving	his	consulting	firm	,	Canter	,	Achenbaum	Associates	.
In	years	past	,	the	ad	industry	's	most	distinguished	executives	did	n't	hesitate	*-1	to	excorciate	Mr.	Achenbaum	.
They	have	since	mellowed	,	although	one	senior	Young	&	Rubicam	executive	,	*-1	echoing	others	,	said	:	``	I	think	0	ad	agencies	owe	Carl	-LCB-	Spielvogel	-RCB-	a	vote	of	thanks	for	*	getting	him	out	of	the	consulting	business	.	''
But	industry	executives	also	believe	0	*	hiring	Mr.	Achenbaum	is	a	shrewd	move	for	Backer	Spielvogel	,	a	unit	of	Saatchi	&	Saatchi	.
Mr.	Achenbaum	has	counted	among	his	clients	some	of	the	most	visible	blue-chip	advertisers	in	the	country	,	including	Nissan	,	Toyota	,	Seagram	and	Backer	Spielvogel	clients	Hyundai	and	J.P.	Morgan	.
At	Backer	Spielvogel	,	he	will	work	with	clients	and	potential	clients	on	marketing	strategies	;	aside	from	agency	compensation	issues	,	he	helped	Nissan	,	for	example	,	come	up	with	its	positioning	and	pricing	for	its	new	Infiniti	line	.
His	client	contacts	,	meanwhile	,	could	prove	a	gold	mine	for	an	agency	that	*T*-291	has	had	few	new	business	wins	of	late	.
``	I	've	done	over	40	ad	agency	searches	-LCB-	for	clients	-RCB-	,	so	I	have	a	pretty	good	notion	of	what	clients	are	interested	in	*T*-1	when	they	look	for	an	agency	*T*-2	,	''	Mr.	Achenbaum	said	*T*-3	.
As	a	consultant	,	he	has	given	seminars	*ICH*-1	at	agencies	including	Ogilvy	&	Mather	on	how	*	to	win	new	business	*T*-2	.
Mr.	Spielvogel	said	0	he	hopes	0	Mr.	Achenbaum	will	do	some	strategic	consulting	at	the	agency	for	``	non-clients	,	in	hopes	that	they	become	clients	.	''
At	Backer	Spielvogel	,	Mr.	Spielvogel	's	hallmark	has	been	personal	involvement	with	all	major	clients	.
He	pampers	them	;	he	invites	them	to	fabulous	parties	;	he	strokes	them	.
Mr.	Achenbaum	,	too	,	delves	into	his	clients	'	business	.
``	Carl	has	a	much	higher	degree	of	intimacy	with	his	clients	than	*	is	ordinary	for	an	agency	his	size	.
And	with	Al	's	record	of	*	being	a	delver	and	a	detail	guy	,	you	can	see	how	the	two	fit	*T*-1	,	''	said	*T*-2	Alan	Gottesman	,	an	analyst	with	PaineWebber	.
Mr.	Achenbaum	's	move	follows	the	announcement	last	month	that	his	consulting	partner	,	Stanley	Canter	,	66	,	would	retire	.
When	the	announcement	came	out	*T*-1	,	``	I	picked	up	the	phone	and	said	,	`	Why	do	n't	you	come	to	us	?	'	''	Mr.	Spielvogel	said	0	*T*-2	.
Mr.	Achenbaum	,	who	*T*-292	had	been	considering	*-1	paring	down	his	firm	or	merging	it	with	another	small	consulting	outfit	,	soon	agreed	.
The	two	men	are	longtime	friends	and	tennis	partners	,	*-1	having	met	about	25	years	ago	.
Before	*-1	becoming	a	consultant	in	1974	,	Mr.	Achenbaum	was	a	senior	executive	at	J.	Walter	Thompson	Co	.
He	spent	most	of	his	career	*-1	formulating	marketing	strategies	,	but	became	best-known	for	*	chipping	away	at	ad	agency	compensation	.
Ad	agencies	typically	earned	a	straight	15	%	commission	;	if	a	client	spent	$	100	million	*U*	on	TV	time	,	the	agency	made	$	15	million	*U*	.
But	Mr.	Achenbaum	pioneered	negotiated	fees	,	which	*T*-293	often	worked	out	to	less	than	15	%	.
More	recently	,	he	negotiated	``	indemnification	''	clauses	in	which	an	ad	agency	in	some	cases	must	pay	a	client	if	it	drops	the	account	*T*-1	.
He	ultimately	became	so	well-known	for	*	cutting	compensation	,	however	,	that	clients	did	n't	seek	him	out	for	anything	else	.
``	I	was	very	frustrated	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
``	The	fact	of	the	matter	is	,	0	I	am	a	marketer	.
That	's	another	reason	-LCB-	for	the	Backer	Spielvogel	job	-RCB-	.
It	struck	me	as	a	way	0	*	to	get	back	to	what	I	really	want	*-3	to	do	*T*-2	*T*-1	.	''
Mr.	Spielvogel	added	pointedly	:	``	The	pressure	on	commissions	did	n't	begin	with	Al	Achenbaum	.	''
Mr.	Spielvogel	said	0	Mr.	Achenbaum	will	work	with	clients	*-1	to	determine	the	mix	of	promotion	,	merchandising	,	publicity	and	other	marketing	outlets	,	and	to	integrate	those	services	.
He	will	concentrate	on	,	among	others	,	J.P.	Morgan	and	Hyundai	.
Mr.	Achenbaum	helped	Morgan	in	its	recent	agency	search	,	and	he	has	a	long	relationship	with	Hyundai	,	which	*T*-294	is	having	severe	troubles	,	including	declining	sales	.
``	The	trail	of	revenue	is	increasingly	going	away	from	pure	advertising	,	and	going	towards	other	services	,	''	Mr.	Spielvogel	said	*T*-1	.
Instead	of	*-2	being	just	an	ad	agency	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	:	``	We	have	redefined	our	mission	here	.
Our	mission	is	*	to	help	our	clients	grow	,	and	to	use	every	tool	of	marketing	communications	*	to	accomplish	that	.	''
Industry	executives	are	wishing	Mr.	Achenbaum	well	.
Leonard	Matthews	,	then-president	of	the	American	Association	of	Advertising	Agencies	,	called	Mr.	Achenbaum	a	``	quisling	''	in	an	incendiary	1987	speech	.
Yesterday	,	Mr.	Matthews	,	now	a	consultant	with	the	Stamford	,	Conn.	,	firm	Matthews	&	Johnston	,	quipped	,	``	I	think	0	he	'll	be	very	good	at	that	-LCB-	new	job	-RCB-	.
And	much	better	at	that	than	at	-LCB-	the	price-cutting	-RCB-	0	he	's	been	doing	*T*-1	recently	.	''

Cotton	Inc.	,	the	fiber	company	that	*T*-295	represents	cotton	growers	,	will	begin	a	new	ad	campaign	,	developed	*	by	Ogilvy	&	Mather	,	Thanksgiving	Day	.
J.	Nicholas	Hahn	,	Cotton	Inc.	's	president	and	chief	executive	,	was	an	outspoken	critic	of	WPP	Group	's	acquisition	of	Ogilvy	Group	earlier	this	year	.
During	the	takeover	,	Mr.	Hahn	said	0	he	would	put	his	account	up	for	review	if	WPP	's	bid	were	successful	,	but	he	did	n't	*?*	.
Cotton	Inc.	's	new	$	9	million	*U*	campaign	calls	cotton	the	``	Fabric	of	Our	Lives	.	''
The	campaign	replaces	its	``	*	Take	Comfort	in	Cotton	''	ads	and	marks	the	end	of	its	national	cooperative	advertising	efforts	.
For	years	,	the	company	's	ads	were	tied	*-246	in	with	pitches	for	Cannon	sheets	or	Martex	towels	,	for	example	,	and	an	announcer	at	the	end	of	the	ads	would	tell	customers	where	*	to	``	find	the	true	performance	label	*T*-1	.	''
With	the	new	TV	spots	,	Ogilvy	&	Mather	has	opted	for	a	family	style	with	lots	of	laughter	,	hugs	and	tears	.
``	We	're	making	a	fairly	obvious	plea	for	some	emotional	reaction	,	''	says	*T*-1	Tom	Rost	,	creative	director	at	Ogilvy	&	Mather	.
Cotton	Inc.	will	spend	nearly	$	2	million	*U*	on	broadcasting	on	Thanksgiving	Day	alone	,	*-1	advertising	on	such	programs	as	``	Good	Morning	America	,	''	``	Macy	's	Thanksgiving	Day	Parade	''	and	the	NFL	holiday	game	.
Frank	Mingo	Dies	at	49
Frank	L.	Mingo	,	one	of	the	pioneers	of	advertising	targeted	*	at	black	audiences	,	died	at	the	age	of	49	after	a	stroke	.
Mr.	Mingo	was	chief	executive	officer	of	the	Mingo	Group	,	which	he	founded	*T*-297	in	1977	and	which	*T*-296	created	ads	for	the	black	market	.
Clients	include	Miller	Brewing	Co.	and	General	Motors	.
Mr.	Mingo	was	hospitalized	*-1	Sept.	23	and	died	Monday	,	according	to	Samuel	J.	Chisholm	,	the	agency	's	president	and	chief	operating	officer	.

Revenue	increased	20	%	to	$	246.6	million	*U*	from	$	204.8	million	*U*	.
Prime	Minister	Lee	Kuan	Yew	,	Singapore	's	leader	and	one	of	Asia	's	leading	statesmen	for	30	years	,	recently	announced	his	intention	*	to	retire	next	year	--	though	not	necessarily	to	end	his	influence	.
The	prime	minister	,	whose	hair	*T*-298	is	thinning	and	gray	and	whose	face	*T*-299	has	a	perpetual	pallor	,	nonetheless	continues	*-1	to	display	an	energy	,	a	precision	of	thought	and	a	willingness	*	to	say	publicly	what	most	other	Asian	leaders	dare	*-2	say	*T*-300	only	privately	.
The	66-year-old	Mr.	Lee	recently	spent	an	hour	*-1	discussing	the	state	of	Asia	and	the	world	with	two	Journal	reporters	in	his	plainly	furnished	,	wood-paneled	office	.
The	interview	did	not	touch	on	Singapore	's	domestic	affairs	.
*-3	Skipping	personal	pleasantries	,	Mr.	Lee	picked	up	exactly	where	he	left	off	*T*-2	several	months	earlier	--	before	the	government	crackdown	in	China	--	when	he	had	warned	that	the	orthodox	leadership	in	Beijing	feared	a	plurality	of	views	*T*-1	.
Excerpts	follow	:
On	China	's	turmoil	:	``	It	is	a	very	unhappy	scene	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
``	It	took	Zhao	Ziyang	-LRB-	former	premier	and	party	chief	-RRB-	10	years	*-2	to	build	a	team	of	economists	who	*T*-301	understood	how	the	Western	economies	work	*T*-1	and	now	that	team	is	part	in	exile	,	part	being	rusticated	*	and	part	missing	.	''
*	Rebuilding	that	team	,	Mr.	Lee	predicted	0	*T*-1	,	will	take	another	10	years	.
``	That	's	very	sad	for	China	and	for	Asia	because	China	could	have	been	a	good	engine	for	growth	,	not	just	for	Hong	Kong	and	Taiwan	but	for	Japan	,	Korea	and	the	rest	of	Asia	.	''
On	similarities	between	China	and	the	Soviet	Union	:	``	In	important	particulars	,	the	Soviets	are	different	from	the	Chinese	.
They	are	already	industrialized	...	.
Their	problem	is	one	of	inefficiency	of	an	industrial	economy	.
The	Chinese	problem	is	much	greater	--	it	's	how	*	to	industrialize	*T*-1	*	to	begin	with	.	''
*-1	Asked	*-2	if	the	Soviets	,	like	Chinese	officials	,	wo	n't	one	day	face	a	similar	conflict	between	the	desire	*	to	liberalize	economically	and	yet	retain	political	control	,	Mr.	Lee	said	,	``	I	would	think	that	the	Soviets	face	a	deeper	dilemma	because	they	have	been	more	in	blinkers	than	the	Chinese	--	I	mean	*	keeping	their	people	cut	off	*-3	from	the	outside	world	.	''
Mikhail	Gorbachev	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	,	is	ahead	of	China	's	leaders	in	his	awareness	of	the	world	.
``	But	I	think	0	the	Soviet	peoples	are	more	introverted	than	the	Chinese	.	''
Regardless	,	he	said	*T*-1	,	he	still	believes	0	the	Soviet	Union	,	while	*-2	falling	far	short	of	the	efficiency	of	a	Western	economy	,	may	well	manage	*-2	to	improve	considerably	.
On	Asia-Pacific	prosperity	:	``	If	America	can	keep	up	the	present	situation	--	her	markets	open	for	another	15	years	,	with	adjustments	,	and	Japan	can	grow	and	not	cut	back	,	and	so	too	,	Korea	,	Taiwan	,	Hong	Kong	,	Singapore	,	ASEAN	,	Australia	and	New	Zealand	--	then	in	15	years	,	the	economies	of	these	countries	would	be	totally	restructured	*-2	to	be	able	*-3	to	almost	sustain	growth	by	themselves	.	''
In	such	an	arrangement	,	``	all	benefit	,	''	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
``	And	if	the	Europeans	come	in	,	they	benefit	too	.
It	's	not	a	zero-sum	game	.	''
*-2	Asked	*-3	about	the	possibility	of	greater	economic	cooperation	among	Asia-Pacific	nations	,	which	*T*-1	will	be	discussed	*-247	Nov.	6	and	7	at	a	ministerial	meeting	in	Canberra	,	Mr.	Lee	said	0	the	goal	``	is	*	to	have	a	free	and	open	world	trading	system	.	''
An	Asian	bloc	is	n't	intended	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
``	That	's	not	possible	.	''
On	U.S.-Japan	relations	:	``	I	'm	encouraged	.
I	think	0	the	earlier	strident	notes	struck	*	by	-LCB-	U.S.	Commerce	Secretary	Robert	-RCB-	Mosbacher	and	-LCB-	U.S.	Trade	Representative	-RCB-	Carla	Hills	have	been	more	rounded	.
I	believe	0	the	U.S.	is	becoming	more	patient	and	circumspect	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
``	It	's	the	total	relationship	that	*T*-2	is	important	.	''
The	total	relationship	,	as	Mr.	Lee	sees	it	,	is	``	the	flow	of	dollars	to	the	U.S.	0	*T*-2	to	fund	the	deficits	,	the	investments	0	the	Japanese	are	making	*T*-1	in	the	U.S.	in	order	*-3	to	satisfy	American	demand	that	American	products	consumed	*	in	America	should	be	made	*-248	as	much	as	possible	in	America	by	Americans	with	Japanese	technology	and	capital	.	''
Japan	's	recent	political	turbulence	,	Mr.	Lee	said	0	*T*-1	,	may	mean	0	Japan	will	slow	market	adjustments	.
``	They	'll	be	more	timorous	in	*-1	tackling	their	own	voters	,	like	*	opening	up	more	to	agricultural	imports	from	America	,	*	hurting	their	farmers	.	''
On	U.S.	military	presence	in	Asia	:	*-3	Asked	*-4	if	his	offer	*	to	allow	the	American	military	to	use	facilities	in	Singapore	would	help	preserve	America	's	presence	in	the	region	at	bases	in	the	Philippines	,	he	said	,	``	What	we	have	done	*T*-302	is	*	make	it	*EXP*-1	easier	for	the	Philippines	to	continue	*-5	to	host	American	bases	without	it	being	said	0	they	are	lackeys	of	the	imperialists	and	the	only	ones	in	Asia	or	in	Southeast	Asia	.
We	are	willing	*-1	to	share	the	political	burden	of	*	being	host	to	America	,	an	imperial	power	.
We	think	0	it	is	n't	such	a	great	burden	,	that	it	carries	no	stigma	,	and	we	are	prepared	*-1	to	do	it	.	''
On	U.S.-Philippine	relations	:	``	It	's	such	a	mixed-up	relationship	going	back	into	history	...	.
I	really	do	not	understand	how	it	is	that	Filipinos	feel	so	passionately	involved	in	this	father	figure	that	they	want	*-4	to	dispose	of	*T*-1	and	yet	they	need	*T*-1	*T*-2	.
I	just	do	n't	understand	it	.
My	relationships	with	the	British	are	totally	different	.
They	lorded	it	over	me	.
They	did	me	some	good	.
They	did	themselves	even	more	good	.
They	let	me	down	when	the	Japanese	came	down	-LCB-	during	World	War	II	-RCB-	*T*-1	...	.
I	do	n't	feel	down	or	done	in	because	I	show	British	serials	on	my	television	network	or	read	their	books	.
I	mean	0	it	is	a	normal	adult	relationship	.
``	But	the	Filipinos	and	the	Americans	,	when	I	talk	to	them	*T*-1	,	there	's	so	much	passion	about	Filipino	manhood	being	diminished	*	as	a	result	of	*	being	squatted	upon	*	by	the	Americans	and	so	on	.
The	occasional	Englishman	tries	*-1	to	put	on	airs	but	we	let	it	pass	...	.
It	's	just	comic	when	they	try	*-2	to	pretend	0	they	're	still	the	master	race	*T*-1	.	''
Mr.	Lee	added	that	the	Filipinos	are	``	making	it	*EXP*-3	very	difficult	''	for	the	U.S.	military	presence	to	last	beyond	five	or	10	years	.
On	military	alternatives	if	the	U.S.	pulls	back	:	``	The	Soviets	already	are	present	.
I	suppose	0	sooner	or	later	,	the	Japanese	would	have	*-1	to	fill	up	a	large	part	of	the	gap	on	the	naval	side	.
Maybe	the	Chinese	,	maybe	even	the	Indians	.	''
On	economic	consequences	of	a	diminished	U.S.	presence	:	``	America	is	the	only	major	power	in	recent	history	that	*T*-303	has	used	its	military	might	*-1	to	sustain	a	system	that	*T*-304	enables	all	participants	to	equally	benefit	without	her	as	the	provider	of	the	security	taking	royalties	.	''
*-3	Asked	*-4	why	so	few	nations	seem	*-2	to	share	his	views	of	America	*T*-1	,	he	said	,	``	Many	people	see	it	that	way	.
But	they	have	just	taken	it	for	*-1	granted	*-2	.	''
On	Cambodia	:	``	*	Let	's	assume	that	-LCB-	former	Cambodian	leader	Prince	Norodom	-RCB-	Sihanouk	does	what	the	press	wants	him	to	do	*T*-1	and	joins	up	with	-LCB-	Vietnamese-backed	Cambodian	leader	-RCB-	Hun	Sen	.
Is	the	trouble	over	?
Can	Sihanouk	and	Hun	Sen	knock	off	the	Khmer	Rouge	still	supported	*	by	China	?
He	ca	n't	*?*	.
``	What	*T*-305	is	the	way	forward	?
*	To	get	the	Khmer	Rouge	as	part	of	a	process	for	elections	.
And	when	they	lose	*T*-1	,	then	we	can	expect	China	to	stop	aid	.
*	Let	's	put	it	bluntly	.
The	Chinese	can	not	be	seen	*-1	to	have	made	use	of	the	Khmer	Rouge	and	then	discard	them	.	''

Everything	looked	good	as	neurosurgeon	Walter	Levy	and	colleagues	carefully	cut	away	a	woman	's	spinal	tumor	at	the	Cleveland	Clinic	in	1978	.
*-1	Using	small	electrical	shocks	applied	*	to	her	feet	,	they	were	able	*-1	to	monitor	sensory	nerves	.
The	shocks	generated	nerve	impulses	that	*T*-306	traveled	via	spine	to	brain	and	showed	up	clearly	on	a	brain-wave	monitor	,	*	indicating	no	damage	to	the	delicate	spinal	tissue	.
Then	,	says	*ICH*-1	Dr.	Levy	,	``	she	woke	up	*-2	paralyzed	.	''
The	damage	was	to	her	motor	nerves	,	which	*T*-2	could	n't	be	monitored	*-251	along	with	the	sensory	nerves	,	he	explains	0	*T*-1	.
The	tragedy	,	he	adds	0	*T*-1	,	``	galvanized	me	''	to	look	for	a	way	0	*	to	prevent	similar	cases	*T*-2	.
Dr.	Levy	's	answer	may	come	with	a	new	kind	of	magnetic	brain	probe	,	a	device	that	he	and	dozens	of	U.S.	researchers	are	studying	*T*-307	with	great	hope	.
Besides	*-1	holding	the	promise	of	safer	spinal	surgery	,	the	probe	could	improve	the	diagnosis	of	brain	and	nerve	disorders	such	as	strokes	and	multiple	sclerosis	.
*	Perhaps	most	exciting	,	the	device	is	thrusting	open	a	window	to	the	workings	of	the	brain	.
The	probe	,	which	*T*-308	is	painless	,	non-invasive	and	apparently	harmless	,	employs	strong	magnetic	fields	*-1	to	induce	small	whirlwinds	of	electricity	within	the	brain	.
If	*-1	positioned	over	the	brain	's	motor-control	area	,	the	hand-held	electromagnets	generate	nerve	impulses	that	*T*-309	zip	down	motor	nerves	and	activate	muscles	,	*	making	,	say	,	a	finger	twitch	.
In	principle	,	they	will	enable	doctors	to	check	the	body	's	motor	system	the	way	0	an	electrician	tests	a	home	's	electrical	circuits	by	*-2	running	current	through	them	*T*-1	.
``	Until	now	,	we	've	had	no	objective	way	of	*	measuring	motor	function	,	''	says	*T*-1	Keith	Chiappa	,	a	neurologist	conducting	clinical	tests	with	the	devices	at	Boston	's	Massachusetts	General	Hospital	.
``	All	0	we	could	do	*T*-1	was	tell	a	patient	,	`	*	squeeze	my	fingers	as	hard	as	you	can	*?*	'	or	`	*	raise	your	arm	.	'
``	Under	the	best	circumstances	such	tests	are	subjective	;	when	a	patient	is	unconscious	*T*-1	,	they	do	n't	work	at	all	.
Magnetic	brain	tweaking	started	in	the	early	1900s	,	when	researchers	produced	flashes	of	light	in	the	visual	field	with	magnets	*T*-1	.
In	the	1960s	,	Mayo	Clinic	researchers	developed	magnetic	devices	0	*T*-1	to	stimulate	motor	nerves	in	the	hand	and	other	limbs	.
But	for	brain	tests	,	the	unwieldy	machines	``	would	have	required	patients	to	stand	on	their	heads	,	''	says	0	*T*-1	Reginald	Bickford	,	a	researcher	at	the	University	of	California	at	San	Diego	.
The	field	took	off	in	1985	after	scientists	at	Britain	's	Sheffield	University	developed	a	handy	,	compact	magnet	for	brain	stimulation	.
Since	then	,	at	least	two	commercial	versions	have	been	put	*-252	on	the	U.S.	market	,	and	an	estimated	500	have	been	sold	*-253	.
In	August	,	a	Chicago	conference	on	such	devices	attracted	more	than	100	researchers	,	who	*T*-310	reported	studies	on	everything	from	brain	mapping	to	physical	therapy	.
``	We	do	n't	feel	0	we	can	use	-LCB-	the	devices	-RCB-	routinely	in	surgery	yet	,	but	we	're	getting	close	,	''	says	*T*-1	Dr.	Levy	,	who	*T*-311	is	now	with	the	University	of	Pittsburgh	.
A	problem	,	he	adds	0	*T*-1	,	is	that	anesthetized	brains	are	more	resistant	to	magnetic	stimulation	than	awake	ones	.
The	devices	could	help	*-1	indicate	when	surgery	would	help	*T*-2	,	says	0	*T*-3	Charles	Tator	,	a	University	of	Toronto	neurosurgeon	.
For	example	,	paralyzed	car-crash	victims	occasionally	have	some	intact	spinal	tissues	that	*T*-1	,	if	*-2	preserved	*-3	by	emergency	surgery	,	enable	partial	recovery	.
But	such	operations	typically	are	n't	performed	*-2	because	there	is	no	sign	*ICH*-1	right	after	an	injury	that	surgery	would	be	beneficial	.
``	The	cost	-LCB-	of	magnetic	stimulators	-RCB-	would	seem	like	peanuts	if	we	could	retrieve	limb	function	''	in	such	people	,	Dr.	Tator	says	0	*T*-1	.
Scientists	caution	0	there	is	a	chance	0	the	magnet	technique	might	spark	seizures	in	epileptics	.
But	no	significant	problems	have	been	reported	*-254	among	hundreds	of	people	tested	*	with	the	devices	.
The	main	sensation	,	besides	*	feeling	like	a	puppet	jerked	*	with	invisible	strings	,	is	``	like	a	rap	on	the	head	,	''	says	0	*T*-1	Sam	Bridgers	,	a	neurologist	who	*T*-313	has	studied	the	brain	stimulators	at	Yale	University	.
One	apparent	side	effect	is	a	minor	increase	in	a	brain	hormone	.
And	some	doctors	who	*T*-314	have	conducted	hours	of	tests	on	themselves	report	temporary	headaches	.
At	least	two	companies	,	Cadwell	Laboratories	Inc.	of	Kennewick	,	Wash.	,	and	Novametrix	Medical	Systems	Inc.	of	Wallingford	,	Conn.	,	now	sell	versions	of	the	magnetic	devices	.
The	machines	,	which	*T*-1	at	$	12,500	*U*	are	inexpensive	by	medical	standards	,	have	n't	been	approved	*-2	in	the	U.S.	for	marketing	as	brain	stimulators	but	are	sold	for	*	stimulating	nerves	in	the	hand	,	legs	and	other	non-brain	areas	.
Researchers	can	apply	for	permission	*	to	use	the	probes	for	brain	studies	.
At	the	University	of	Kentucky	,	a	team	led	*	by	Dean	Currier	,	a	physical	therapy	researcher	,	is	testing	the	stimulators	in	conjunction	with	electric	shocks	*	to	induce	muscle	contractions	*	to	help	*-1	prevent	wasting	of	thigh	muscles	after	knee	surgery	.
Similarly	,	a	Purdue	University	team	led	*	by	heart	researcher	W.A.	Tacker	hopes	*-2	to	develop	ways	0	*	to	magnetically	induce	cardiac	muscle	contractions	*T*-1	.
The	devices	might	someday	serve	as	temporary	pacemakers	or	restarters	for	stopped	hearts	,	says	0	*T*-1	Dr.	Tacker	,	whose	prototype	*T*-2	was	dubbed	*-255	the	``	Tacker	whacker	.	''
The	devices	'	most	remarkable	possibilities	,	though	,	involve	the	brain	.
*	Probing	with	the	stimulators	,	National	Institutes	of	Health	scientists	recently	showed	how	the	brain	reorganizes	motor-control	resources	after	an	amputation	*T*-1	.
Similar	studies	are	expected	*-3	to	reveal	how	stroke	patients	'	brains	regroup	*T*-1	--	a	first	step	toward	*	finding	ways	0	*	to	bolster	that	process	and	speed	rehabilitation	*T*-2	.
Scientists	also	are	exploring	memory	and	perception	with	the	new	machines	.
At	the	State	University	of	New	York	at	Brooklyn	,	researchers	flash	two	groups	of	different	letters	on	a	computer	screen	in	front	of	human	guinea	pigs	.
Between	flashes	,	certain	areas	in	subjects	'	brains	are	jolted	*-256	with	a	magnetic	stimulator	.
When	the	jolt	is	timed	*-257	just	right	*T*-1	,	the	subjects	do	n't	recall	*-2	seeing	the	first	group	of	letters	.
``	Where	does	that	first	stimulus	go	*T*-1	?	''	exclaims	*T*-2	SUNY	neurologist	Paul	Maccabee	.
``	*	Trying	*-2	to	answer	that	is	suggesting	all	kinds	of	theories	,	''	such	as	precisely	where	and	how	the	brain	processes	incoming	signals	from	the	eyes	*T*-1	.
He	and	others	say	that	the	machines	are	weak	enough	that	they	do	n't	jeopardize	the	memory	.
Both	the	SUNY	team	and	researchers	at	the	National	Magnet	Laboratory	in	Cambridge	,	Mass.	,	are	working	with	more	potent	magnetic	brain	stimulators	.
Among	other	things	,	the	stronger	devices	may	be	able	*-1	to	summon	forth	half-forgotten	memories	and	induce	mood	changes	,	neurologists	say	0	*T*-2	.
Du	Pont	Co.	,	Hewlett-Packard	Co.	and	Los	Alamos	National	Laboratory	said	0	they	signed	a	three-year	,	$	11	million	*U*	agreement	*	to	collaborate	on	superconductor	research	.
The	collaboration	will	include	at	least	25	researchers	and	will	be	aimed	*-2	primarily	at	*	developing	thin	films	of	high-temperature	superconductors	for	use	in	electronics	,	the	companies	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	materials	,	discovered	*	during	the	past	three	years	,	conduct	electricity	without	resistance	and	promise	smaller	,	faster	computers	and	other	new	technologies	.
Joint-research	programs	have	proliferated	as	U.S.	companies	seek	*-1	to	spread	the	risks	and	costs	of	*	commercializing	new	superconductors	and	to	meet	the	challenges	posed	*	by	foreign	consortia	,	especially	in	Japan	.
The	latest	research	pact	bolsters	Du	Pont	's	growing	portfolio	of	investments	in	superconductors	.
The	Wilmington	,	Del.	,	chemicals	concern	previously	signed	research	superconductor	agreements	with	Oak	Ridge	National	Laboratory	and	with	Argonne	National	Laboratory	.

J.C.	PENNEY	Co.	,	Dallas	,	said	0	it	issued	$	350	million	*U*	of	securities	backed	*	by	credit-card	receivables	.
The	offering	was	priced	*-258	with	an	8.95	%	coupon	rate	at	99.1875	%	*-1	to	yield	9.19	%	.
The	retailer	said	0	the	securities	are	expected	*-1	to	be	rated	*-2	triple-A	by	Standard	&	Poor	's	Corp.	and	Aaa	by	Moody	's	Investors	Service	Inc	.
They	pay	interest	only	for	115	months	,	with	principal	payments	beginning	thereafter	.
The	expected	average	life	of	the	certificates	is	10	years	,	with	the	final	scheduled	payment	in	October	,	2001	.
First	Boston	Corp.	is	sole	underwriter	.
As	part	of	the	transaction	,	J.C.	Penney	will	sell	a	portion	of	its	credit-card	receivables	to	its	JCP	Receivables	Inc.	unit	,	which	*T*-315	will	then	transfer	them	to	a	master	trust	.
The	trust	will	issue	the	certificates	.

J.C.	Penney	will	continue	*-1	to	service	the	receivables	.
Battle-tested	Japanese	industrial	managers	here	always	buck	up	nervous	newcomers	with	the	tale	of	the	first	of	their	countrymen	0	*T*-1	to	visit	Mexico	,	a	boatload	of	samurai	warriors	blown	*	ashore	375	years	ago	.
``	From	the	beginning	,	it	*EXP*-1	took	a	man	with	extraordinary	qualities	*	to	succeed	in	Mexico	,	''	says	*T*-2	Kimihide	Takimura	,	president	of	Mitsui	group	's	Kensetsu	Engineering	Inc.	unit	.
Here	in	this	new	center	for	Japanese	assembly	plants	just	across	the	border	from	San	Diego	,	turnover	is	dizzying	,	infrastructure	shoddy	,	bureaucracy	intense	.
Even	after-hours	drag	;	``	karaoke	''	bars	,	where	Japanese	revelers	sing	over	recorded	music	*T*-1	,	are	prohibited	*-2	by	Mexico	's	powerful	musicians	union	.
Still	,	20	Japanese	companies	,	including	giants	such	as	Sanyo	Industries	Corp.	,	Matsushita	Electronics	Components	Corp.	and	Sony	Corp.	have	set	up	shop	in	the	state	of	Northern	Baja	California	.
*	Keeping	the	Japanese	happy	will	be	one	of	the	most	important	tasks	facing	conservative	leader	Ernesto	Ruffo	when	he	takes	office	Nov.	1	,	as	the	first	opposition	governor	in	Mexico	's	modern	history	*T*-1	.
Mexico	,	with	its	desperate	need	for	investment	,	and	Japan	,	with	its	huge	budget	surplus	,	would	seem	like	a	perfect	match	.
But	the	two	countries	remain	separated	by	a	cultural	barrier	wider	than	the	ocean	.
Conservative	Japanese	investors	are	put	off	*-1	by	what	they	consider	*T*-2	Mexico	's	restrictive	investment	regulations	and	loose	work	habits	.
From	the	Mexicans	'	viewpoint	,	vaunted	tactics	of	methodical	Japanese	managers	do	n't	count	for	much	in	a	land	where	a	saying	says	``	there	are	no	fixed	rules	.	''	*T*-1
Japan	ranks	as	only	the	fourth	largest	foreign	investor	in	Mexico	,	with	5	%	of	the	total	investments	.
That	is	just	1	%	of	all	the	money	0	Japan	has	invested	*T*-1	abroad	.
Mexican	President	Carlos	Salinas	de	Gortari	would	like	*-1	to	change	that	.
The	young	president	so	admires	Japanese	discipline	that	he	sends	his	children	to	a	Japanese	school	in	Mexico	City	.
He	already	has	finagled	a	$	2	billion	*U*	loan	*PPA*-1	from	the	Japanese	government	.
But	Mexico	urgently	needs	more	help	.
Mr.	Salinas	's	unpopular	Institutional	Revolutionary	Party	,	or	PRI	,	faces	congressional	elections	in	1991	.
For	the	PRI	to	stand	a	chance	,	Mr.	Salinas	has	*-2	to	press	on	with	an	economic	program	that	so	far	*T*-1	has	succeeded	in	*-3	lowering	inflation	and	providing	moderate	economic	growth	.
But	*	maintaining	the	key	components	of	his	strategy	--	a	stable	exchange	rate	and	high	level	of	imports	--	will	consume	enormous	amounts	of	foreign	exchange	.
Mr.	Salinas	needs	big	investment	inflows	--	quickly	.
The	problem	is	that	Japanese	businesses	make	decisions	with	a	view	well	beyond	the	coming	months	that	*T*-2	weigh	so	heavily	on	Mr.	Salinas	.
``	The	Japanese	will	come	to	Mexico	,	but	not	immediately	,	''	says	*T*-1	Kazushige	Suzuki	,	director-general	of	the	Japanese	External	Trade	Organization	in	Mexico	.
If	not	now	,	when	?
``	When	the	fruit	is	ripe	*T*-2	,	it	falls	from	the	tree	by	itself	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
*-1	Pressed	*-2	on	the	matter	,	he	is	more	specific	.
``	There	will	be	big	Japanese	investments	probably	five	to	10	years	from	now	.	''
Ryukichi	Imai	,	Japan	's	ambassador	to	Mexico	,	agrees	that	Mexico	may	be	too	eager	.
``	There	seems	*-1	to	be	a	presumption	*ICH*-2	in	some	sectors	of	-LRB-	Mexico	's	-RRB-	government	that	there	is	a	lot	of	Japanese	money	waiting	behind	the	gate	,	and	that	by	*	slightly	opening	the	gate	,	that	money	will	enter	Mexico	.
I	do	n't	think	0	that	is	the	case	.	''
Mexican	officials	maintain	0	the	Japanese	reserve	is	only	a	result	of	unfamiliarity	.
``	Because	of	distance	,	it	*EXP*-2	takes	a	while	for	them	to	appreciate	the	economic	stability	0	we	've	achieved	*T*-1	,	''	says	*T*-3	one	economic	policymaker	.
Mexico	is	sending	a	number	of	missions	to	Japan	*-1	looking	for	a	major	breakthrough	investment	in	telecommunications	,	petrochemicals	or	tourism	.
It	is	hoped	that	other	Japanese	would	then	follow	the	leader	.
But	Japanese	investors	say	that	their	reluctance	*	to	invest	stems	not	only	from	concerns	about	Mexico	's	economic	outlook	,	but	also	reservations	about	Mexico	's	recently	revamped	investment	law	.
*-1	Unable	*-2	to	get	a	new	law	through	a	congress	with	a	strong	leftist	bloc	,	Mexico	jury-rigged	the	existing	law	's	regulations	.
It	created	special	20-year	trusts	*-1	to	allow	foreigners	100	%	ownership	in	some	once-closed	industries	.
It	also	made	artful	use	of	semantics	,	*-1	redefining	as	non-strategic	industries	some	that	*T*-3	had	been	in	the	national	domain	.
``	Those	devices	do	n't	give	sufficient	certainty	to	our	bosses	in	Japan	,	''	says	*T*-1	Yasuo	Nakamura	,	representative	of	the	Industrial	Bank	of	Japan	.
Mr.	Nakamura	cites	the	case	of	a	customer	who	*T*-4	wants	*-1	to	build	a	giant	tourism	complex	in	Baja	and	*T*-4	has	been	trying	for	eight	years	*-2	to	get	around	Mexican	restrictions	on	foreign	ownership	of	beachfront	property	.
He	could	develop	the	beach	through	a	trust	,	but	instead	is	trying	*-1	have	his	grandson	become	a	naturalized	Mexican	so	his	family	gains	direct	control	.
Some	say	0	the	best	hope	for	the	Mexicans	is	*	catching	the	eye	of	Japan	by	*-2	promoting	the	one	industry	0	the	Japanese	clearly	like	*T*-1	--	the	border	assembly	plants	,	known	*	as	``	maquiladoras	,	''	which	*T*-5	are	open	to	100	%	foreign	control	.
``	We	must	do	more	*	to	help	the	Japanese	here	in	Baja	if	we	want	them	to	invest	elsewhere	,	''	says	*T*-1	Mr.	Ruffo	,	the	governor-elect	of	the	National	Action	Party	and	himself	a	succesful	businessman	.
Plant	operators	are	heartened	*-1	by	Mr.	Ruffo	's	pledge	*	to	cut	corruption	associated	*	with	the	ruling	party	officials	.
But	Mr.	Ruffo	frets	that	an	even	bigger	problem	could	be	protectionism	from	the	U.S.	,	where	some	politicians	oppose	what	they	consider	*T*-2	Japanese	efforts	*	to	use	maquiladoras	*-3	to	crack	the	U.S.	market	through	the	back	door	*T*-1	.
*-1	Shaken	by	tumbling	stock	prices	and	pessimistic	projections	of	U.S.	economic	growth	,	currency	analysts	around	the	world	have	toned	down	their	assessments	of	the	dollar	's	near-term	performance	.
Most	of	the	10	analysts	polled	*	last	week	by	Dow	Jones	International	News	Service	in	Frankfurt	,	Tokyo	,	London	and	New	York	expect	the	U.S.	dollar	to	ease	only	mildly	in	November	.
Opinion	is	mixed	over	its	three-month	prospects	.
Half	of	those	polled	*	see	the	currency	trending	lower	over	the	next	three	months	,	while	the	others	forecast	a	modest	rebound	after	the	New	Year	.
In	late	afternoon	New	York	trading	yesterday	,	the	dollar	stood	at	1.8415	West	German	marks	,	up	from	1.8340	marks	late	Monday	,	and	at	142.85	yen	,	up	from	141.90	yen	late	Monday	.
A	month	ago	,	a	similar	survey	predicted	0	the	dollar	would	be	trading	at	1.8690	marks	and	139.75	yen	by	the	end	of	October	.
Sterling	was	trading	at	$	1.5805	*U*	,	down	from	$	1.5820	*U*	late	Monday	.
In	Tokyo	Wednesday	,	the	U.S.	currency	was	trading	at	about	142.95	yen	at	midmorning	,	up	from	142.80	yen	at	the	opening	and	up	from	Tuesday	's	Tokyo	close	of	142.15	yen	.
The	average	of	estimates	of	the	10	economists	polled	*	puts	the	dollar	around	1.8200	marks	at	the	end	of	November	and	at	141.33	yen	.
By	late	January	,	the	consensus	calls	for	the	dollar	to	be	trading	around	1.8200	marks	and	near	142	yen	.
Those	with	a	bullish	view	see	the	dollar	trading	up	near	1.9000	marks	and	145	yen	,	while	the	dollar	bears	see	the	U.S.	currency	trading	around	1.7600	marks	and	138	yen	.
A	number	of	those	polled	*	predict	0	the	dollar	will	slip	as	the	Federal	Reserve	eases	interest	rates	.
David	Owen	,	an	economist	at	Kleinwort	Benson	&	Co.	in	London	,	said	0	he	expects	further	cuts	in	short-term	U.S.	rates	in	an	effort	*	to	encourage	a	narrowing	of	the	trade	gap	and	to	ensure	a	soft	landing	in	the	U.S.	economy	.
Robert	White	,	a	vice	president	and	manager	of	corporate	trade	at	First	Interstate	of	California	,	agreed	with	that	view	and	predicted	0	the	U.S.	federal	funds	rate	will	drop	to	between	7	3\/4	%	and	8	%	*U*	within	60	days	from	its	current	level	at	8	13\/16	%	.
Fed	funds	is	the	rate	0	banks	charge	each	other	*T*-1	on	overnight	loans	;	the	Fed	influences	the	rate	by	*-2	adding	or	draining	reserves	from	the	banking	system	.
Mr.	White	also	predicted	a	half-point	cut	in	the	U.S.	discount	rate	in	the	near	future	.
The	discount	rate	,	currently	7	%	,	is	the	rate	0	the	Fed	charges	member	banks	*T*-1	for	loans	,	*	using	government	securities	as	collateral	.
He	expects	such	a	cut	``	because	of	problems	in	several	sectors	of	the	economy	,	particularly	real	estate	and	automobiles	.	''
*-1	Bolstering	his	argument	,	the	Commerce	Department	reported	yesterday	that	new	home	sales	for	September	were	down	14	%	from	August	's	revised	3.1	%	fall	.
The	drop	marked	the	largest	monthly	tumble	since	a	19	%	slide	in	January	1982	.
In	last	month	's	survey	,	a	number	of	currency	analysts	predicted	0	the	dollar	would	be	pressured	*-1	by	a	narrowing	of	interest	rate	differentials	between	the	U.S.	and	West	Germany	.
Indeed	,	in	early	October	the	West	German	central	bank	raised	its	discount	and	Lombard	rates	by	a	full	percentage	point	.
Several	other	European	central	banks	,	notably	in	Britain	,	followed	the	West	German	Bundesbank	's	lead	by	*-1	raising	their	own	key	rates	.
And	a	week	later	,	Japan	raised	its	official	discount	rate	by	a	half	point	to	3.75	%	.
The	Japanese	discount	rate	is	the	central	bank	's	base	rate	on	loans	to	commercial	banks	.
After	a	surprisingly	sharp	widening	in	the	U.S.	August	merchandise	trade	deficit	--	$	10.77	billion	*U*	from	a	revised	$	8.24	billion	*U*	in	July	and	well	above	expectations	--	and	a	startling	190-point	drop	in	stock	prices	on	Oct.	13	,	the	Federal	Reserve	relaxed	short-term	interest	rates	,	*-1	knocking	fed	funds	from	around	9	%	to	8	3\/4	%	.
But	predictions	that	central	banks	of	the	Group	of	Seven	-LRB-	G-7	-RRB-	major	industrial	nations	would	continue	their	massive	dollar	sales	went	astray	,	as	the	market	drove	the	dollar	downward	on	its	own	,	*-1	reacting	to	Wall	Street	's	plunge	and	subsequent	price	volatility	,	lower	U.S.	interest	rates	and	signs	of	a	slowing	U.S.	economy	.
G-7	consists	of	the	U.S.	,	Japan	,	Britain	,	West	Germany	,	Canada	,	France	and	Italy	.
Tomoshige	Kakita	,	senior	deputy	manager	in	the	treasury	department	of	Mitsui	Bank	Ltd.	in	Tokyo	,	suggested	that	uncertainty	about	U.S.	stocks	and	bonds	has	made	Japanese	investors	leery	of	*	holding	those	securities	in	the	near	term	,	thus	*	damping	dollar	demand	.
But	,	Mr.	Kakita	added	0	*T*-2	,	once	U.S.	equities	regain	some	stability	,	players	will	move	back	into	dollar-denominated	investments	,	especially	Treasury	bonds	,	whose	value	*T*-6	rises	when	interest	rates	decline	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Kakita	said	0	the	key	dollar-yen	exchange	rate	is	at	135	yen	.
``	If	135	is	broken	*-1	,	some	panic	will	be	seen	*-2	,	''	he	predicted	*T*-3	,	*-4	explaining	that	Japanese	institutions	are	comfortable	with	the	dollar	anywhere	between	current	levels	and	135	yen	.
Jens-Uwe	Fischer	,	a	senior	trader	at	Manufacturers	Hanover	Trust	Co.	in	Frankfurt	,	said	0	he	expects	the	dollar	to	recover	within	the	next	three	months	to	around	1.88	marks	as	U.S.	economic	data	,	particularly	U.S.	trade	figures	,	level	off	.
He	contended	that	the	Fed	wo	n't	ease	rates	further	,	but	predicted	0	Bundesbank	officials	will	relax	key	rates	in	West	Germany	.
Alfred	Zapfel	,	chief	trader	at	Bank	of	Boston	in	Frankfurt	,	took	an	opposite	stance	.
He	said	0	he	expects	U.S.	interest	rates	to	decline	,	*	dragging	the	dollar	down	to	around	1.80	marks	by	the	end	of	January	after	a	short-lived	dash	to	1.87	marks	by	the	end	of	November	.
West	German	interest	rates	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	,	will	remain	unchanged	.
``	But	I	'm	not	one	of	these	great	dollar	bears	0	you	see	more	of	*T*-1	these	days	,	''	Mr.	Zapfel	said	*T*-2	.
``	I	ca	n't	really	see	it	dropping	far	below	1.80	marks	.	''
Scott	Greene	,	chief	foreign	exchange	dealer	with	Julius	Baer	&	Co.	in	New	York	,	fits	the	description	of	a	``	great	dollar	bear	.	''
He	predicted	0	the	U.S.	unit	will	skid	below	1.80	marks	to	around	1.78	marks	this	month	and	1.75	marks	by	the	beginning	of	the	new	year	.
``	We	're	finally	seeing	the	culmination	of	all	the	recessionary	buildup	of	the	last	few	months	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	,	*-2	noting	0	a	continuing	downward	trend	in	U.S.	interest	rates	,	a	shaky	stock	market	and	``	gloomier	economic	times	ahead	''	all	signal	a	significantly	lower	dollar	.
In	the	wake	of	British	Chancellor	of	the	Exchequer	Nigel	Lawson	's	surprise	resignation	and	sterling	's	subsequent	nose-dive	,	most	analysts	had	little	good	0	*	to	say	*T*-1	about	the	pound	's	near-term	prospects	.
Mr.	Owen	of	Kleinwort	Benson	suggested	that	the	new	chancellor	,	John	Major	,	will	take	a	tough	line	in	his	autumn	statement	later	this	month	,	*-1	helping	*-2	to	underpin	the	pound	.
But	,	he	warned	0	*T*-1	,	the	currency	will	remain	at	risk	.
On	the	Commodity	Exchange	in	New	York	,	gold	for	current	delivery	dropped	$	3.10	*U*	to	$	374.70	*U*	an	ounce	in	moderate	trading	.
Estimated	volume	was	3.5	million	ounces	.
In	early	trading	in	Hong	Kong	Wednesday	,	gold	was	quoted	*-1	at	$	373.80	*U*	an	ounce	.

West	Germany	will	repeal	the	unpopular	turnover	tax	on	securities	transactions	as	of	Jan.	1	,	1991	,	Economics	Minister	Helmut	Haussmann	said	0	*T*-1	.
He	said	0	the	government	will	also	repeal	the	1	%	transaction	tax	on	the	first-time	purchase	of	stakes	in	companies	.
The	announcement	follows	several	comments	*ICH*-2	by	government	officials	that	the	government	will	speed	up	the	repeal	of	the	tax	,	which	*T*-7	was	originally	scheduled	*-1	to	fall	with	the	start	of	the	single	internal	market	in	the	European	Community	at	the	end	of	1992	.
The	securities-turnover	tax	has	been	long	criticized	*-1	by	the	West	German	financial	community	because	it	tends	*-2	to	drive	securities	trading	and	other	banking	activities	out	of	Frankfurt	into	rival	financial	centers	,	especially	London	,	where	trading	transactions	is	n't	taxed	*-4	*T*-3	.
The	tax	has	raised	less	than	one	billion	marks	-LRB-	$	545.3	million	*U*	-RRB-	annually	in	recent	years	,	but	the	government	has	been	reluctant	*-1	to	abolish	the	levy	for	budgetary	concerns	.
In	the	interview	,	Mr.	Haussmann	did	n't	specify	the	amount	of	revenue	0	the	government	will	lose	*T*-1	after	the	tax	disappears	.
The	new	date	means	that	the	tax	will	be	officially	repealed	*-1	before	the	end	of	the	current	parliamentary	term	at	the	end	of	1990	and	*-2	guarantees	its	abolition	even	if	the	current	center-right	coalition	loses	the	elections	in	December	1990	.
Earlier	this	year	,	President	Bush	made	a	final	``	take-it-or-leave	it	''	offer	on	the	minimum	wage	:	an	increase	to	$	4.25	*U*	an	hour	over	three	years	,	and	only	if	*	accompanied	*-1	by	a	lower	wage	for	the	first	six	months	of	a	job	.
Now	,	the	White	House	has	decided	*-1	to	accept	the	higher	wage	over	only	two	years	.
The	sub-minimum	wage	would	apply	only	to	first-time	teen-age	workers	for	90	days	.
The	White	House	had	enough	votes	*	to	sustain	a	veto	but	chose	*-1	to	avoid	a	confrontation	.
The	only	permanent	losers	will	be	the	200,000	or	so	workers	0	everyone	agrees	0	*T*-2	will	be	priced	*-1	out	of	a	job	at	the	$	4.25	*U*	rate	0	Congress	is	likely	*	to	approve	*T*-3	today	.
It	*EXP*-1	is	compromises	such	as	this	that	*T*-8	convince	Washington	's	liberals	that	if	they	simply	stay	the	course	,	this	administration	will	stray	from	its	own	course	on	this	and	other	issues	.
The	head	trader	of	Chemical	Banking	Corp.	's	interest-rate	options	group	has	left	the	company	,	following	valuation	errors	that	*T*-9	resulted	in	a	$	33	million	*U*	charge	against	its	third-quarter	results	.
Chemical	said	0	Steven	Edelson	resigned	recently	,	but	one	individual	close	to	the	situation	said	0	the	resignation	was	forced	*-1	.
Mr.	Edelson	could	n't	be	reached	*-1	for	comment	.
A	separate	inquiry	by	Chemical	cleared	Mr.	Edelson	of	allegations	that	he	had	been	lavishly	entertained	*-1	by	a	New	York	money	broker	.
That	inquiry	has	n't	resolved	similar	allegations	involving	another	Chemical	options	trader	.
In	other	personnel	changes	stemming	from	problems	in	its	options	unit	:
--	Chemical	named	James	Kennedy	,	a	trader	in	swaps	contracts	for	the	bank	,	to	assume	Mr.	Edelson	's	duties	and	to	be	trading	manager	for	derivative	products	,	including	swaps	and	interest-rate	options	.
--	Lee	Wakeman	,	vice	president	in	charge	of	options	research	who	*T*-10	discovered	the	valuation	errors	and	was	asked	by	senior	management	*-1	to	straighten	out	the	mess	,	resigned	*-2	to	take	a	position	in	asset	and	liability	management	at	Continental	Bank	in	Chicago	.
Mr.	Wakeman	,	whom	Chemical	tried	*-1	to	keep	*T*-2	,	did	n't	return	calls	for	comment	.
Separately	,	Chemical	confirmed	that	it	took	an	undisclosed	charge	*ICH*-1	in	the	second	quarter	for	losses	on	forward-rate	agreements	involving	foreign	currency	written	*	by	its	branch	in	Frankfurt	,	West	Germany	.
A	Chemical	spokeswoman	said	0	the	second-quarter	charge	was	``	not	material	''	and	that	no	personnel	changes	were	made	*-1	as	a	result	.
The	spokeswoman	said	0	the	Frankfurt	situation	was	``	totally	different	''	from	problems	in	the	interest-rate	options	unit	.
According	to	individuals	familiar	with	the	situation	,	the	Frankfurt	loss	stemmed	from	a	computer	program	for	*	calculating	prices	on	forward-rate	agreements	that	*T*-11	failed	*-2	to	envision	an	interest-rate	environment	where	short-term	rates	were	equal	to	*RNR*-1	or	higher	than	*RNR*-1	long-term	rates	*T*-3	.
While	the	incidents	involving	interest-rate	options	and	forward-rate	agreements	are	unrelated	,	some	observers	say	0	they	echo	a	1987	incident	in	which	Bankers	Trust	New	York	Corp.	restated	the	value	of	its	foreign	exchange	options	contracts	downward	by	about	$	80	million	*U*	*T*-1	.
These	complex	products	require	close	monitoring	because	each	must	be	valued	*-1	separately	in	light	of	current	market	conditions	.
In	an	interest-rate	options	contract	,	a	client	pays	a	fee	to	a	bank	for	custom-tailored	protection	against	adverse	interest-rate	swings	for	a	specified	period	.
In	a	forward-rate	agreement	,	a	client	agrees	to	an	exchange	rate	on	a	future	currency	transaction	.
Some	competitors	maintain	0	the	interestrate	option	loss	,	in	particular	,	may	have	resulted	more	from	Chemical	's	taking	large	and	often	contrarian	positions	than	a	valuation	problem	.
*-1	Started	*-2	three	years	ago	,	Chemical	's	interest-rate	options	group	was	a	leading	force	in	the	field	.
From	1987	to	1988	,	the	value	of	Chemical	's	option	contracts	outstanding	mushroomed	to	$	37	billion	*U*	from	$	17	billion	*U*	.
More	importantly	,	the	volume	of	options	written	*	exceeded	those	purchased	*	by	almost	2-to-1	.
With	such	a	lopsided	book	of	options	,	traders	say	0	*T*-1	,	Chemical	was	more	vulnerable	to	erroneous	valuation	assumptions	.
The	Chemical	spokeswoman	said	0	the	bank	has	examined	its	methodologies	and	internal	controls	.
``	We	consider	our	internal	controls	to	have	worked	well	,	''	she	said	*T*-1	,	*-2	adding	that	some	procedures	have	been	strengthened	*-3	.
Its	valuation	methodologies	,	she	said	0	*T*-1	,	``	are	recognized	*-2	as	some	of	the	best	on	the	Street	.
Not	a	lot	was	needed	*-1	to	be	done	*-2	.
When	Thomas	W.	Wathen	went	big	league	last	year	*T*-1	,	he	acquired	a	treasure-trove	of	Americana	along	with	a	well-known	but	ailing	security	business	:	Pinkerton	's	Inc	.
There	was	a	wanted	poster	offering	``	Rewards	for	the	Arrest	of	Express	and	Train	Robbers	Frank	James	and	Jesse	W.	James	''	and	the	original	Pinkerton	's	logo	with	an	open	eye	and	the	inscription	``	We	Never	Sleep	,	''	which	*T*-12	inspired	the	phrase	``	private	eye	.	''
Then	there	were	two	gold	watches	once	owned	*	by	Allan	Pinkerton	,	who	*T*-13	founded	the	company	in	Chicago	in	1850	.
But	there	were	supposed	*-1	to	be	three	,	Mr.	Wathen	's	company	claims	0	*T*-2	.
The	missing	watch	is	emblematic	of	the	problems	0	Mr.	Wathen	encountered	*T*-1	in	*	building	his	closely	held	California	Plant	Protection	Security	Service	into	the	largest	detective	and	security	agency	in	the	U.S.	through	acquisitions	.
The	ever-optimistic	Mr.	Wathen	has	learned	that	while	*	acquiring	a	big	brand-name	company	can	be	a	shortcut	to	growth	,	it	can	also	bring	a	host	of	unforeseen	problems	.
``	We	cleared	out	a	lot	of	rats	'	nests	,	''	says	*T*-1	the	60-year-old	security	veteran	.
Mr.	Wathen	,	who	*T*-14	started	his	career	as	an	Air	Force	investigator	and	worked	as	a	security	officer	for	several	large	companies	,	built	his	California	Plant	Protection	from	a	tiny	mom-and-pop	security	patrol	firm	here	in	the	San	Fernando	Valley	.
He	joined	the	firm	in	1963	and	*	bought	it	from	the	owners	the	next	year	.
Over	the	next	20	years	,	California	Plant	Protection	opened	125	offices	around	the	country	.
Yet	although	California	Plant	Protection	was	netting	bigger	and	bigger	clients	--	the	firm	provided	security	for	the	1984	Summer	Olympics	in	Los	Angeles	--	it	still	did	n't	have	the	name	recognition	of	Pinkerton	's	.
So	when	American	Brands	Inc.	decided	*-1	to	sell	the	unit	in	1987	as	part	of	a	divestiture	of	its	food	and	security	industries	operations	,	Mr.	Wathen	saw	a	chance	*	to	accomplish	several	objectives	.
He	decided	0	he	could	easily	merge	Pinkerton	's	operations	with	his	own	while	*-1	slashing	overhead	costs	because	the	two	already	operated	in	many	of	the	same	cities	.
He	could	acquire	a	staff	of	loyal	Pinkerton	's	employees	,	many	of	whom	*T*-15	had	spent	their	entire	careers	with	the	firm	,	he	could	eliminate	a	competitor	and	he	could	get	the	name	recognition	0	he	'd	wanted	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Wathen	also	relished	the	chance	*	to	demonstrate	0	an	entrepreneur	like	himself	,	who	*T*-16	'd	spent	his	whole	career	in	the	security	business	,	could	run	Pinkerton	's	better	than	an	unfocused	conglomerate	or	investment	banker	.
``	The	security	business	is	my	favorite	subject	.
I	love	this	business	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	Most	of	the	LBO	guys	do	n't	know	how	*	to	run	a	business	anyway	*T*-1	.	''
But	there	were	hitches	,	not	the	least	of	which	*T*-17	was	that	,	Mr.	Wathen	says	,	he	proceeded	almost	blindly	in	*	doing	the	$	95	million	*U*	acquisition	,	which	*T*-18	was	completed	*-1	in	January	1988	.
``	We	were	n't	allowed	*-1	to	do	any	due	diligence	because	of	competitive	reasons	.
If	we	had	*?*	,	it	might	have	scared	us	off	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
Five	years	of	rapid	expansion	under	American	Brands	,	with	an	emphasis	on	*	marketing	the	agency	's	services	instead	of	improving	them	,	had	hurt	Pinkerton	's	profits	,	Mr.	Wathen	claims	0	*T*-1	.
He	says	0	his	team	could	n't	tell	whether	accounts	receivable	had	been	paid	*-1	or	not	.
Pinkerton	's	had	locked	itself	into	low-price	contracts	*-1	to	win	new	business	,	with	no	hope	of	profitability	until	the	contracts	expired	*-3	,	he	adds	0	*T*-2	.
And	regional	offices	were	``	egregiously	overstaffed	,	''	he	claims	0	*T*-1	.
One	office	had	19	people	doing	the	work	of	three	,	``	and	half	of	the	employees	had	company	automobiles	.	''
American	Brands	declined	*-1	to	comment	on	Mr.	Wathen	's	accusations	.
The	acquisition	combined	the	country	's	second-largest	security	company	,	Pinkerton	's	,	with	1987	sales	of	$	410	million	*U*	,	and	the	fourth	largest	,	California	Plant	Protection	,	with	$	250	million	*U*	in	sales	,	*-1	creating	the	industry	's	biggest	firm	,	which	*T*-19	took	on	the	Pinkerton	's	name	.
Even	after	*-1	divesting	itself	of	$	120	million	*U*	of	unprofitable	business	,	the	new	Pinkerton	's	will	have	sales	of	about	$	610	million	*U*	this	year	and	operating	profit	roughly	double	the	industry	average	of	2%-3	%	*U*	of	sales	,	says	0	*T*-3	Lloyd	Greif	of	Sutro	&	Co.	in	Los	Angeles	,	which	*T*-20	arranged	the	Pinkerton	's	acquisition	.
Mr.	Wathen	says	0	his	turnaround	strategy	*ICH*-1	has	been	simple	:	*	just	hack	away	at	the	fat	.
He	began	by	*-1	closing	120	of	the	combined	companies	'	260	offices	in	two	months	,	*	eliminating	about	31	%	of	the	company	's	2,500-person	adminstrative	staff	,	including	more	than	100	sales	positions	.
He	shut	down	the	company	's	tony	New	York	headquarters	.
Pinkerton	's	world	headquarters	today	is	a	nondescript	,	two-story	office	building	across	the	street	from	the	small	Van	Nuys	Airport	.
Next	,	Mr.	Wathen	raised	Pinkerton	's	rates	,	which	*T*-21	were	75-cents-an-hour	lower	than	California	Plant	Protection	's	average	rate	of	around	$	8.63	*U*	.
And	he	got	rid	of	low-margin	businesses	that	*T*-22	just	were	n't	making	money	for	the	company	.
Mr.	Wathen	,	who	*T*-23	says	0	Pinkerton	's	had	a	loss	of	nearly	$	8	million	*U*	in	1987	under	American	Brands	,	boasts	that	he	's	made	Pinkerton	's	profitable	again	.
But	Mr.	Wathen	's	team	still	must	pay	down	about	$	82	million	*U*	of	long-term	bank	debt	from	the	acquisition	within	the	next	four	years	.
Last	year	,	earnings	of	the	combined	companies	did	n't	cover	debt	service	and	Pinkerton	's	was	forced	*-1	to	borrow	$	20	million	*U*	of	subordinated	debt	.
``	We	would	n't	have	had	*-1	to	refinance	if	a	lot	of	the	problems	had	n't	been	there	,	''	Mr.	Wathen	says	*T*-2	.
This	year	,	Mr.	Wathen	says	0	the	firm	will	be	able	*-1	to	service	debt	and	still	turn	a	modest	profit	.
Now	Pinkerton	's	could	become	entangled	in	a	protracted	legal	fracas	with	its	former	parent	.
The	company	recently	filed	suit	in	state	court	in	Los	Angeles	against	American	Brands	,	*-2	seeking	at	least	$	40	million	*U*	in	damages	from	the	Old	Greenwich	,	Conn.-based	company	.
The	suit	alleges	that	American	Brands	misrepresented	the	financial	condition	of	Pinkerton	's	before	the	sale	,	failed	*-1	to	disclose	pending	lawsuits	and	material	contracts	in	which	Pinkerton	's	was	in	default	*T*-3	,	had	n't	registered	the	Pinkerton	's	name	and	trademark	in	the	United	Kingdom	and	did	n't	tell	California	Plant	Protection	about	some	labor	controversies	.
``	We	have	previously	had	discussions	with	representatives	of	Pinkerton	's	Inc.	concerning	the	-LCB-	sale	of	the	company	-RCB-	and	we	concluded	that	we	did	not	have	liability	under	the	contract	,	''	says	*T*-1	American	Brands	.
``	As	this	is	now	a	litigation	matter	,	we	have	no	further	comment	.	''
And	then	there	's	the	case	of	the	missing	gold	watch	.
The	lawsuit	alleges	that	an	inventory	of	Pinkerton	's	memorabilia	disclosed	that	one	of	the	watches	had	n't	been	forked	*-1	over	by	American	Brands	.
``	American	Brand	's	failure	*	to	surrender	the	gold	watch	has	damaged	new	Pinkerton	's	in	an	amount	as	yet	0	-LCB-	*T*-3	to	be	-RCB-	determined	*-4	and	deprived	it	of	a	valuable	artifact	for	which	it	had	bargained	*T*-2	,	''	the	suit	charges	*T*-5	.
The	key	to	Pinkerton	's	future	will	be	*	sticking	to	what	it	does	*T*-1	best	--	*	being	a	security	company	,	says	0	*T*-2	Mr.	Wathen	.
The	company	is	also	renewing	its	emphasis	on	investigations	,	particularly	undercover	investigations	for	corporations	.
Although	investigations	now	account	for	only	about	5	%	of	Pinkerton	's	total	revenue	,	that	side	of	the	business	has	traditionally	been	the	more	``	glamorous	''	of	the	two	and	it	carries	historical	and	sentimental	value	.

Walter	Kirchberger	,	an	analyst	with	PaineWebber	Inc.	,	said	that	*	offering	holders	a	higher	,	$	70-a-share	price	is	``	a	fairly	effective	method	of	*	blocking	''	the	Stena-Tiphook	bid	.
Michael	Carstens	,	an	analyst	with	Tucker	Anthony	&	R.L.	Day	,	added	that	the	sale	of	assets	would	allow	Sea	Containers	to	focus	on	its	core	container	businesses	.

You	'd	think	0	all	the	stories	about	well-heeled	communities	and	developers	getting	HUD	grants	would	prompt	Congress	to	tighten	up	on	upscale	housing	subsidies	.
No	way	.
Congress	has	just	made	it	*EXP*-1	easier	for	the	affluent	*	to	qualify	for	insured	loans	from	the	deficit-ridden	Federal	Housing	Administration	.
It	appears	that	the	only	thing	0	Congress	is	learning	*T*-1	from	the	HUD	story	is	how	*	to	enlarge	its	control	of	the	honey	pot	going	to	special	interests	*T*-2	.
Right	now	,	the	largest	loan	0	the	FHA	can	insure	*T*-1	in	high-cost	housing	markets	is	$	101,250	*U*	.
Last	week	,	housing	lobbies	persuaded	Congress	*-1	to	raise	the	ceiling	to	$	124,875	*U*	,	*	making	FHA	loans	more	accessible	to	the	well-to-do	.
But	it	does	that	at	the	cost	of	*	deepening	the	taxpayer	's	exposure	if	the	FHA	is	forced	*-1	to	pay	for	more	loans	going	sour	.
This	is	no	idle	fear	last	year	the	FHA	lost	$	4.2	billion	*U*	in	loan	defaults	.
But	the	higher	mortgage	ceiling	is	only	the	starter	kit	for	what	Senator	Alan	Cranston	and	Majority	Leader	George	Mitchell	have	*T*-1	in	mind	for	housing	.
The	Senate	Banking	Committee	will	begin	hearings	*ICH*-1	next	week	on	their	proposal	*	to	expand	existing	federal	housing	programs	.
Other	Senators	want	*-1	to	lower	the	down	payments	required	*	on	FHA-insured	loans	.
That	would	be	a	formula	for	*	ensuring	even	more	FHA	red	ink	.
Experience	has	shown	that	the	most	important	element	in	*	predicting	a	housing-loan	default	is	the	down	payment	.
Because	a	purchaser	can	use	an	FHA	loan	*-2	to	finance	all	points	and	closing	costs	,	the	FHA	can	wind	up	*-1	lending	more	than	a	house	is	worth	.
If	housing	prices	continue	*-1	to	fall	,	many	borrowers	would	be	better	off	*-2	walking	away	from	their	homes	and	leaving	taxpayers	with	the	losses	.
Much	the	same	thing	happened	with	busted	S&Ls	,	a	problem	0	Congress	just	``	solved	''	*T*-1	with	a	$	166	billion	*U*	bailout	.
We	hear	that	HUD	Secretary	Jack	Kemp	is	toying	with	*-1	going	along	with	some	of	the	Cranston-Mitchell	proposals	.
That	sounds	like	a	formula	for	*	ensuring	that	he	gets	dragged	*-1	into	the	next	HUD	tar	pit	.
A	group	of	27	Senators	has	written	Mr.	Kemp	*-2	urging	him	*-1	to	reject	Cranston-Mitchell	and	focus	on	programs	that	*T*-29	empower	the	poor	rather	than	create	vast	new	government	obligations	.
But	even	if	he	agrees	,	Mr.	Kemp	does	n't	write	the	nation	's	housing	law	--	Congress	does	*?*	.
And	the	majority	of	Members	cynically	view	the	current	discrediting	of	HUD	as	mainly	a	chance	*	to	shove	through	their	own	slate	of	projects	.
Exhibit	A	is	last	week	's	House	vote	*	to	fund	40	pet	projects	out	of	the	same	discretionary	fund	that	*T*-30	is	at	the	heart	of	the	HUD	scandal	.
None	of	the	grants	had	been	requested	*-1	by	HUD	,	judged	*-1	competitively	or	were	the	subject	of	a	single	hearing	.
More	and	more	observers	now	realize	that	the	key	to	*	ending	future	HUD	scandals	lies	in	*	forcing	Congress	to	clean	up	its	own	act	.
This	week	,	a	Baltimore	Sun	editorial	said	0	the	Lantos	subcommittee	on	HUD	should	forget	about	Sam	Pierce	's	testimony	for	the	moment	and	call	some	other	witnesses	:	the	various	congressional	sponsors	of	the	40	pork-barrel	projects	.
The	Sun	concluded	that	Mr.	Pierce	is	only	part	of	the	problem	--	and	a	part	that	*T*-31	's	gone	.

The	New	Orleans	oil	and	gas	exploration	and	diving	operations	company	added	that	it	does	n't	expect	any	further	adverse	financial	impact	from	the	restructuring	.
In	the	third	quarter	,	the	company	,	which	*T*-34	is	61%-owned	*-1	by	Murphy	Oil	Corp.	of	Arkansas	,	had	a	net	loss	of	$	46.9	million	*U*	,	or	91	cents	a	share	,	compared	with	a	restated	loss	of	$	9	million	*U*	,	or	18	cents	a	share	,	a	year	ago	.

After	20	years	of	*	pushing	labor	proposals	0	*T*-1	to	overhaul	the	nation	's	health-care	system	,	Bert	Seidman	of	the	AFL-CIO	is	finding	interest	from	an	unlikely	quarter	:	big	business	.
Corporate	leaders	,	frustrated	*	by	double-digit	increases	in	health-care	costs	,	are	beginning	*-1	to	sound	like	liberal	Democrats	.
Failure	*	to	check	rising	medical	costs	ultimately	could	``	lead	some	of	us	who	today	*T*-1	are	free-market	advocates	to	re-examine	our	thinking	and	positions	with	respect	to	government-sponsored	national	health	insurance	,	''	Arthur	Puccini	,	a	General	Electric	Co.	vice	president	,	warned	0	*T*-3	earlier	this	year	.
The	pocketbook	impact	of	health	benefits	has	driven	business	and	labor	to	a	surprising	consensus	.
Both	the	AFL-CIO	and	the	National	Association	of	Manufacturers	are	calling	for	measures	0	*T*-1	to	control	rising	costs	,	improve	quality	and	provide	care	to	the	31	million	Americans	who	currently	*T*-35	lack	health	insurance	.
Agreement	on	these	points	is	a	long	way	from	a	specific	program	,	and	nobody	expects	the	U.S.	to	rush	toward	radical	restructuring	of	the	health-care	system	.
But	there	are	signs	that	labor-management	cooperation	could	change	the	politics	of	health-care	legislation	and	the	economics	of	medicine	.
``	I	ca	n't	remember	a	time	when	virtually	everyone	can	agree	on	what	the	problem	is	*T*-1	*T*-3	,	''	says	*T*-2	Mr.	Seidman	,	who	*T*-36	heads	the	AFL-CIO	's	department	dealing	with	health	matters	.
Because	the	Bush	administration	is	n't	taking	the	initiative	on	health	issues	,	business	executives	are	dealing	with	congressional	Democrats	who	*T*-37	champion	health-care	revision	.
``	Business	across	the	country	is	spending	more	time	*-2	addressing	this	issue	,	''	says	*T*-1	Sen.	Edward	Kennedy	-LRB-	D.	,	Mass	.	-RRB-	.
``	It	's	a	bottom-line	issue	.	''
Business	complained	earlier	this	year	when	Sen.	Kennedy	introduced	a	bill	that	*T*-38	would	require	employers	to	provide	a	minimum	level	of	health	insurance	to	workers	but	does	n't	contain	cost-control	measures	*T*-1	.
Partly	in	response	,	a	bipartisan	group	of	senators	from	the	finance	and	labor	committees	is	drafting	a	plan	0	*T*-1	to	attract	broader	support	.
It	will	feature	a	cost-containment	provision	designed	*	*	to	keep	expanded	benefits	from	*-1	fueling	higher	care	prices	.
*-1	At	11.1	%	of	gross	national	product	,	U.S.	health	costs	already	are	the	highest	in	the	world	.
By	contrast	,	Japan	's	equal	6.7	%	of	GNP	,	a	nation	's	total	output	of	goods	and	services	.
Management	and	labor	worry	that	the	gap	makes	U.S.	companies	less	competitive	.
Chrysler	Corp.	estimates	that	health	costs	add	$	700	*U*	*ICH*-1	to	the	price	of	each	of	its	cars	,	about	$	300	to	$	500	*U*	more	per	car	than	foreign	competitors	pay	for	health	.
``	The	cost	of	health	care	is	eroding	standards	of	living	and	sapping	industrial	strength	,	''	complains	*T*-1	Walter	Maher	,	a	Chrysler	health-and-benefits	specialist	.
Labor	is	upset	because	many	companies	are	using	higher	employee	insurance	premiums	,	deductibles	and	co-payments	*	to	deflect	surging	medical	costs	to	workers	.
Health	benefits	are	contentious	issues	in	the	strikes	against	Pittston	Co.	and	Nynex	Corp	.
In	their	new	contract	this	year	,	American	Telephone	&	Telegraph	Co.	and	the	Communications	Workers	of	America	agreed	*-1	to	look	for	``	prompt	and	lasting	national	solutions	''	to	rising	health-care	costs	.
Some	analysts	are	cynical	about	the	new	corporate	interest	in	health-care	overhaul	.
Carl	Schramm	,	president	of	the	Health	Insurance	Association	of	America	,	scoffs	at	``	capitalists	who	*T*-1	want	*-2	to	socialize	the	entire	financing	system	''	for	health	.
``	They	hope	0	they	can	buy	some	government	cost	discipline	,	''	but	this	is	a	false	hope	,	Mr.	Schramm	says	0	*T*-1	.
He	asserts	that	government	has	done	an	even	worse	job	of	*	controlling	its	health	bill	than	business	*?*	.
So	far	neither	the	Bush	administration	nor	Congress	is	prepared	*-1	to	lead	the	way	toward	*	revamping	health	care	.
The	administration	lacks	a	comprehensive	health-care	policy	.
Congress	still	is	struggling	*-1	to	dismantle	the	unpopular	Catastrophic	Care	Act	of	1988	,	which	*T*-39	boosted	benefits	for	the	elderly	and	*-2	taxed	them	*-3	to	pay	for	the	new	coverage	.
A	bipartisan	commission	established	*	by	Congress	and	headed	*	by	Sen.	John	Rockefeller	-LRB-	D.	,	W.Va	.	-RRB-	is	scheduled	*-1	to	present	new	plans	for	*	dealing	with	the	uninsured	and	long-term	care	for	the	elderly	by	next	March	1	.
A	quadrennial	commission	appointed	*	by	Health	and	Human	Services	Secretary	Louis	Sullivan	is	taking	a	broad	look	at	the	economics	of	Medicare	for	the	elderly	,	Medicaid	for	the	poor	and	the	health	system	in	general	.
It	is	expected	*-1	to	report	next	summer	.
``	No	magic	bullet	will	be	discovered	*-1	next	year	,	an	election	year	,	''	says	*T*-2	Rep.	Fortney	Stark	-LRB-	D.	,	Calif	.	-RRB-
But	1991	could	be	a	window	for	action	.
The	pressure	for	change	will	rise	with	costs	.
``	I	think	0	employers	are	really	going	*-1	to	be	the	ones	0	*T*-2	to	push	for	major	change	,	''	says	*T*-3	Sharon	Canner	,	a	health	expert	at	NAM	.
Any	major	attempt	*	to	revamp	the	health-care	system	is	likely	*-1	to	trigger	opposition	from	politically	powerful	interest	groups	,	particularly	the	American	Medical	Association	,	and	perhaps	from	the	public	as	well	,	if	Congress	takes	steps	that	patients	fear	0	*T*-2	will	limit	the	availability	of	care	.
The	NAM	embraces	efforts	*ICH*-2	,	which	both	the	administration	and	the	medical	profession	have	begun	*T*-1	,	*	to	measure	the	effectiveness	of	medical	treatments	and	then	*	to	draft	medical-practice	guidelines	.
Advocates	hope	that	such	standards	will	improve	treatment	while	*-1	limiting	unnecessary	tests	and	medical	procedures	.
HHS	Secretary	Sullivan	estimates	that	as	much	as	25	%	of	the	medical	procedures	performed	*	each	year	may	be	inappropriate	or	unnecessary	.
*	Limiting	care	wo	n't	be	easy	or	popular	.
``	*	To	slow	the	rise	in	total	spending	,	it	*ICH*-1	will	be	necessary	*	to	reduce	per-capita	use	of	services	,	''	the	NAM	warns	*T*-2	in	a	policy	statement	.
This	will	``	require	us	to	define	--	and	redefine	--	what	*T*-40	is	`	necessary	'	or	`	appropriate	'	care	.
This	involves	trade-offs	and	-LCB-	it	-RCB-	cuts	against	the	grain	of	existing	consumer	and	even	provider	conceptions	of	what	*T*-1	is	`	necessary	.	'	''
The	AFL-CIO	also	embraces	treatment	guidelines	.
In	addition	,	it	's	toying	with	an	approach	that	*T*-41	would	impose	health-expenditure	ceilings	or	budgets	on	the	government	as	a	whole	and	on	individual	states	as	a	way	0	*	to	slow	health-care	spending	*T*-1	.
At	a	meeting	here	on	Nov.	15	,	the	labor	federation	plans	*-1	to	launch	a	major	effort	*	to	build	grass-roots	support	for	health-care	overhaul	.
Stelco	Inc.	said	0	it	plans	*-1	to	shut	down	three	Toronto-area	plants	,	*-1	moving	their	fastener	operations	to	a	leased	facility	in	Brantford	,	Ontario	.
The	company	said	0	the	fastener	business	``	has	been	under	severe	cost	pressures	for	some	time	.	''
The	fasteners	,	nuts	and	bolts	,	are	sold	*-1	to	the	North	American	auto	market	.
A	company	spokesman	declined	*-1	to	estimate	the	impact	of	the	closures	on	earnings	.
He	said	0	the	new	facility	will	employ	500	of	the	existing	600	employees	.
The	steelmaker	employs	about	16,000	people	.
Stelco	said	0	it	has	an	option	*	to	lease	a	350,000-square-foot	building	in	Brantford	and	proposes	*-1	to	spend	24.5	million	Canadian	dollars	-LRB-	US$	20.9	million	*U*	-RRB-	on	the	facility	.
The	three	existing	plants	and	their	land	will	be	sold	*-1	.
First	Security	Corp.	said	0	it	tentatively	agreed	*-1	to	acquire	Deseret	Bancorp.	for	stock	valued	*	at	about	$	18	million	*U*	.
Terms	call	for	First	Security	to	issue	about	0.55	share	of	its	stock	for	each	Deseret	share	held	*	,	or	a	total	of	about	550,000	First	Security	shares	.
It	has	about	12.3	million	shares	outstanding	.
Deseret	,	with	about	$	100	million	*U*	in	assets	,	is	the	parent	of	the	Deseret	Bank	,	which	*T*-42	has	six	offices	and	headquarters	at	Pleasant	Grove	,	Utah	.
The	purchase	price	is	equal	to	about	1.65	times	Deseret	's	roughly	$	10.7	million	*U*	book	value	,	or	assets	less	liabilities	.
Salt	Lake	City-based	First	Security	,	with	$	5.4	billion	*U*	in	assets	,	said	0	the	agreement	is	subject	to	shareholder	and	regulatory	approval	,	and	that	it	hopes	*-1	to	complete	the	transaction	early	next	year	.
Georgia-Pacific	Corp.	's	unsolicited	$	3.19	billion	*U*	bid	for	Great	Northern	Nekoosa	Corp.	was	hailed	*-1	by	Wall	Street	despite	a	cool	reception	by	the	target	company	.
William	R.	Laidig	,	Nekoosa	's	chairman	,	chief	executive	officer	and	president	,	characterized	the	$	58-a-share	*U*	bid	as	``	uninvited	''	and	said	0	Nekoosa	's	board	would	consider	the	offer	``	in	due	course	.	''
T.	Marshall	Hahn	Jr.	,	Georgia-Pacific	's	chairman	and	chief	executive	,	said	in	an	interview	that	all	terms	of	the	offer	are	negotiable	.
He	added	that	he	had	spoken	with	Mr.	Laidig	,	whom	he	referred	to	*T*-1	as	a	friend	,	by	telephone	Monday	evening	.
``	I	'm	hopeful	that	we	'll	have	further	discussions	,	''	Mr.	Hahn	said	*T*-1	.
On	Wall	Street	,	takeover	stock	traders	bid	Nekoosa	's	stock	well	above	the	Georgia-Pacific	bid	,	*-1	assuming	that	Nekoosa	's	will	either	be	sold	*-2	to	a	rival	bidder	or	to	Georgia-Pacific	at	a	higher	price	--	as	much	as	$	75	*U*	a	share	,	according	to	some	estimates	.
Yesterday	,	Nekoosa	common	closed	in	composite	New	York	Stock	Exchange	trading	at	$	62.875	*U*	,	up	$	20.125	*U*	,	on	volume	of	almost	6.3	million	shares	.
Georgia-Pacific	closed	down	$	2.50	*U*	,	at	$	50.875	*U*	in	Big	Board	trading	.
Takeover	stock	traders	noted	that	with	the	junk-bond	market	in	disarray	,	Georgia-Pacific	's	bid	is	an	indication	of	where	the	takeover	game	is	headed	*T*-1	:	namely	,	industrial	companies	can	continue	*-2	bidding	for	one	another	,	but	financial	buyers	such	as	leveraged	buy-out	firms	will	be	at	a	disadvantage	in	*	obtaining	financing	.
``	The	way	0	the	world	is	shaping	up	*T*-2	,	the	strategic	buyer	is	going	*-3	to	be	the	rule	and	the	financial	buyer	is	going	*-4	to	be	the	exception	,	''	said	*T*-1	one	trader	.
For	the	paper	industry	specifically	,	most	analysts	said	0	the	deal	will	spur	a	wave	of	paper-company	takeovers	,	possibly	involving	such	companies	as	Union	Camp	Corp.	,	Federal	Paperboard	Co.	and	Mead	Corp	.
The	analysts	argued	that	Georgia-Pacific	's	offer	,	the	first	hostile	bid	ever	among	major	players	in	the	paper	industry	,	ends	the	unwritten	taboo	on	hostile	bids	,	and	will	push	managements	to	look	closely	at	the	industry	's	several	attractive	takeover	candidates	.
``	Consolidation	has	been	long	overdue	.
It	was	just	the	culture	of	the	industry	that	*T*-43	kept	it	from	*-1	happening	.
The	Georgia-Pacific	offer	has	definitely	changed	the	landscape	,	''	said	*T*-1	Gary	Palmero	of	Oppenheimer	&	Co	.
Added	*T*-1	Mark	Rogers	of	Prudential-Bache	Securities	Inc.	:	``	It	*EXP*-2	's	much	easier	*	to	be	second	.	''
A	Georgia-Pacific	acquisition	of	Nekoosa	would	create	the	largest	U.S.	forest-products	company	.
Based	on	1988	sales	,	Georgia-Pacific	*ICH*-1	ranked	third	at	$	9.51	billion	*U*	,	behind	Weyerhaeuser	Co.	at	$	10	billion	*U*	and	International	Paper	Co.	at	$	9.53	billion	*U*	.
Nekoosa	*ICH*-1	ranked	11th	with	sales	of	$	3.59	billion	*U*	.
The	combined	company	would	have	had	1988	sales	of	$	13.1	billion	*U*	.
But	such	a	combination	also	presents	great	risks	.
At	a	time	when	most	analysts	and	industry	consultants	say	0	pulp	and	paper	prices	are	heading	for	a	dive	*T*-1	,	*	adding	capacity	and	debt	could	squeeze	Georgia-Pacific	if	the	industry	declines	more	than	the	company	expects	.
Moreover	,	any	unexpected	strengthening	of	the	dollar	would	hurt	Georgia-Pacific	because	two	of	Nekoosa	's	major	product	lines	--	containerboard	,	which	*T*-44	is	used	*-1	*	to	make	shipping	boxes	,	and	market	pulp	--	are	exported	*-2	in	large	quantities	.
``	Nobody	knows	how	deep	the	cycle	is	going	*-2	to	be	*T*-1	,	''	said	*T*-3	Rod	Young	,	vice	president	of	Resource	Information	Systems	Inc.	,	a	Bedford	,	Mass.	,	economic-forecasting	firm	.
``	Depending	on	how	far	down	you	go	*T*-1	,	it	*EXP*-2	may	be	difficult	*	to	pay	off	that	debt	.	''
One	person	familiar	with	Georgia-Pacific	said	0	the	acquisition	would	more	than	double	the	company	's	debt	of	almost	$	3	billion	*U*	.
It	also	could	be	a	drag	on	Georgia-Pacific	earnings	because	the	roughly	$	1.5	billion	*U*	in	goodwill	--	the	amount	by	which	the	bid	exceeds	Nekoosa	's	book	value	of	$	1.5	billion	*U*	*T*-1	--	will	have	*-2	to	be	subtracted	*-3	from	earnings	over	a	period	of	decades	.
Georgia-Pacific	's	Mr.	Hahn	said	that	a	combined	operation	would	allow	savings	in	many	ways	.
The	two	companies	each	produce	market	pulp	,	containerboard	and	white	paper	.
That	means	0	goods	could	be	manufactured	*-1	closer	to	customers	,	*	saving	shipping	costs	,	he	said	0	*T*-2	.
Moreover	,	production	runs	would	be	longer	,	*	cutting	inefficiencies	from	*	adjusting	machinery	between	production	cycles	.
And	Georgia-Pacific	could	save	money	in	*	selling	pulp	,	because	the	company	uses	its	own	sales	organization	while	Nekoosa	employs	higher-cost	agents	.
Mr.	Hahn	said	0	Georgia-Pacific	has	accounted	in	its	strategy	for	a	``	significant	downturn	''	in	the	pulp	and	paper	industry	,	an	event	that	he	said	0	*T*-1	would	temporarily	dilute	earnings	.
But	he	said	that	even	under	those	conditions	,	the	company	still	would	realize	a	savings	of	tens	of	millions	of	dollars	in	the	first	year	following	a	merger	.
``	The	fit	is	so	good	,	we	see	this	as	a	time	of	opportunity	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
Georgia-Pacific	,	which	*T*-45	has	suspended	its	stock-repurchase	program	,	would	finance	the	acquisition	with	all	bank	debt	,	provided	*	by	banks	led	*	by	BankAmerica	Corp	.
Georgia-Pacific	owns	349,900	Nekoosa	shares	and	*-1	would	need	federal	antitrust	clearance	*	to	buy	more	than	$	15	million	*U*	worth	.
U.S.	clearance	also	is	needed	*-1	for	the	proposed	acquisition	.
For	Nekoosa	,	defense	options	may	be	undercut	*-1	somewhat	by	the	precarious	state	of	the	junk-bond	market	,	which	*T*-46	limits	how	much	value	the	target	could	reach	*T*-3	in	a	debt-financed	recapitalization	.
The	company	's	chairman	,	Mr.	Laidig	,	and	a	group	of	advisers	met	at	the	offices	of	Wachtel	Lipton	Rosen	&	Katz	,	a	law	firm	specializing	in	takeover	defense	.
Nekoosa	also	is	being	advised	*-1	by	Goldman	,	Sachs	&	Co	.
Georgia-Pacific	's	advisers	are	Wasserstein	,	Perella	&	Co.	,	which	*T*-47	stands	*-1	to	receive	a	$	15	million	*U*	fee	if	the	takeover	succeeds	,	and	the	law	firm	of	Shearman	&	Sterling	.
People	familiar	with	Nekoosa	said	0	its	board	is	n't	likely	*-1	to	meet	before	the	week	after	next	*-1	to	respond	to	the	bid	.
The	board	has	10	business	days	0	*	to	respond	*T*-1	.
In	addition	to	the	usual	array	of	defenses	,	including	a	so-called	poison	pill	and	a	staggered	board	,	Nekoosa	has	another	takeover	defense	:	a	Maine	state	law	barring	hostile	bidders	from	*-1	merging	acquired	businesses	for	five	years	.
Nekoosa	is	incorporated	*-1	in	Maine	.
Georgia-Pacific	has	filed	a	lawsuit	in	federal	court	in	Maine	*-1	challenging	the	poison	pill	and	the	Maine	merger	law	.
Nekoosa	's	poison	pill	allows	shareholders	to	vote	*-2	to	rescind	it	,	but	Georgia-Pacific	is	n't	likely	*-1	to	pursue	such	a	course	immediately	because	that	would	take	90	to	120	days	,	and	would	n't	affect	the	provisions	of	the	Maine	law	.
Among	companies	mentioned	*	by	analysts	as	possible	counterbidders	for	Nekoosa	are	*T*-1	International	Paper	,	Weyerhaeuser	,	Canadian	Pacific	Ltd.	and	MacMillan	Bloedel	Ltd	.
``	I	'm	sure	0	everybody	else	is	putting	pencil	to	paper	,	''	said	*T*-1	Kathryn	McAuley	,	an	analyst	with	First	Manhattan	Co	.
International	Paper	and	Weyerhaeuser	declined	*-1	to	comment	.
Canadian	Pacific	could	n't	be	reached	*-2	for	comment	,	and	MacMillan	Bloedel	said	0	it	has	n't	any	plans	*	to	make	a	bid	for	Nekoosa	.
Investors	were	quick	*-1	to	spot	other	potential	takeover	candidates	,	all	of	which	*T*-2	have	strong	cash	flows	and	low-cost	operations	.
Among	paper	company	stocks	that	*T*-48	rallied	on	the	Big	Board	because	of	the	offer	were	*T*-1	Union	Camp	,	up	$	2.75	*U*	to	$	37.75	*U*	,	Federal	Paperboard	,	up	$	1.75	*U*	to	$	27.875	*U*	,	Mead	,	up	$	2.375	*U*	to	$	38.75	*U*	,	and	Temple	Inland	Inc.	,	up	$	3.75	*U*	to	$	62.25	*U*	.
In	over-the-counter	national	trading	,	Bowater	Inc.	jumped	$	1.50	*U*	to	$	27.50	*U*	.
Some	analysts	argued	that	there	wo	n't	be	a	flurry	of	takeovers	because	the	industry	's	continuing	capacity-expansion	program	is	eating	up	available	cash	.
Moreover	,	some	analysts	said	0	they	expect	a	foreign	paper	company	with	deeper	pockets	than	Georgia-Pacific	to	end	up	*-1	acquiring	Nekoosa	,	*-2	signaling	to	the	rest	of	the	industry	that	hostile	bids	are	unproductive	.
``	This	is	a	one-time	event	,	''	said	*T*-1	Lawrence	Ross	of	PaineWebber	Inc.	,	*-2	referring	to	the	Georgia-Pacific	bid	.
But	many	analysts	believe	that	,	given	the	attractiveness	of	paper	companies	'	cash	flows	,	as	well	as	the	frantic	consolidation	of	the	paper	industry	in	Europe	,	there	will	be	at	least	a	few	more	big	hostile	bids	for	U.S.	companies	within	the	next	several	months	.
The	buyers	,	these	analysts	added	0	*T*-1	,	could	be	either	foreign	*RNR*-2	or	other	U.S.	*RNR*-2	concerns	.
``	The	Georgia-Pacific	bid	may	open	the	door	to	a	new	era	of	consolidation	''	in	the	paper	industry	,	said	*T*-1	Mark	Devario	of	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	Inc	.
``	I	do	n't	think	0	anyone	is	now	immune	from	takeover	,	''	said	*T*-1	Robert	Schneider	of	Duff	&	Phelps	Inc.	,	Chicago	.
He	added	:	``	Every	paper	company	management	has	*-1	to	be	saying	to	itself	,	`	Before	someone	comes	after	me	,	I	'm	going	*-2	to	go	after	somebody	.	'	''
Prudential-Bache	's	Mr.	Rodgers	said	0	he	does	n't	see	the	industry	's	capacity-expansion	program	hindering	takeover	activity	.
Several	projects	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	,	are	still	on	the	drawing	board	.
Moreover	,	``	it	*ICH*-1	's	a	lot	cheaper	and	quicker	*ICH*-2	*	to	buy	a	plant	than	*	to	build	one	.	''
Indeed	,	a	number	of	analysts	said	that	Japanese	paper	companies	are	hungry	*-1	to	acquire	additional	manufacturing	capacity	anywhere	in	the	world	.
Some	predicted	that	Nekoosa	will	end	up	*-1	being	owned	*-2	by	a	Japanese	company	.
Meanwhile	,	Shearson	Lehman	's	Mr.	Devario	said	that	,	*-1	to	stay	competitive	,	the	U.S.	paper	industry	needs	*-1	to	catch	up	with	the	European	industry	.
Since	the	most-recent	wave	of	friendly	takeovers	was	completed	*-2	in	the	U.S.	in	1986	,	there	have	been	more	than	100	mergers	and	acquisitions	within	the	European	paper	industry	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
Lyphomed	Inc.	,	Rosemont	,	Ill.	,	and	Medco	Research	Inc.	,	Los	Angeles	,	said	0	the	Food	and	Drug	Administration	granted	full	marketing	approval	for	a	new	drug	for	the	treatment	of	a	condition	in	which	the	heart	beats	between	150	and	200	beats	a	minute	*T*-1	.
The	condition	,	known	*	as	paroxysmal	supraventricular	tachycardia	,	leads	to	dizziness	and	fainting	.
The	typical	healthy	heart	beats	70	times	a	minute	.
The	drug	,	called	*	adenocard	,	returns	the	heart	to	a	normal	rhythm	within	seconds	,	according	to	Lyphomed	.
Medco	Research	developed	the	drug	and	licensed	it	to	Lyphomed	for	sale	in	the	U.S.	and	Canada	.
Private	industry	's	labor	costs	rose	1.2	%	in	the	third	quarter	,	*	matching	the	second-quarter	pace	,	as	health	insurance	costs	continued	*-1	to	soar	,	the	Labor	Department	said	0	*T*-2	.
The	increase	in	wage	and	benefit	costs	in	the	third	quarter	was	greater	than	the	1	%	rise	reported	*	for	the	third	quarter	of	1988	.
``	Wage	increases	and	overall	compensation	increases	are	beginning	*-1	to	curl	upward	a	little	bit	,	''	said	*T*-2	Audrey	Freedman	,	a	labor	economist	at	the	Conference	Board	,	a	business	research	organization	.
``	One	would	have	thought	0	this	would	have	happened	two	or	three	years	ago	as	the	labor	market	tightened	.
It	is	a	considerably	delayed	reaction	and	it	's	not	a	severe	one	at	all	,	''	she	added	*T*-1	.
The	new	data	underscored	the	severity	of	the	nation	's	health-care	cost	problem	.
In	the	12	months	ended	*	in	September	,	wages	and	salaries	of	private-sector	workers	rose	4.4	%	,	while	health	insurance	costs	spurted	by	13.7	%	.
The	consumer	price	index	climbed	4.3	%	in	the	same	period	.
Despite	the	big	increases	in	health-care	costs	,	wages	still	account	for	a	far	greater	share	of	overall	labor	costs	.
The	overall	private-sector	employment	cost	index	,	which	*T*-49	includes	both	wages	and	benefits	,	rose	4.7	%	in	the	12	months	ended	*	in	September	,	compared	with	4.5	%	for	both	the	12	months	ended	*	in	June	and	the	12	months	ended	September	1988	.
Labor	costs	are	climbing	at	a	far	more	rapid	pace	in	the	health	care	industry	than	in	other	industries	.
For	instance	,	wages	of	private-sector	hospital	workers	leaped	6.6	%	in	the	12	months	ended	*	in	September	,	compared	with	4.4	%	for	workers	in	all	industries	.
In	the	third	quarter	,	wages	and	salaries	in	all	private	industry	rose	1.2	%	,	compared	with	1	%	increases	in	both	the	second	quarter	and	in	the	third	quarter	of	1988	.
For	the	past	five	years	,	unions	have	n't	managed	*-1	to	win	wage	increases	as	large	as	those	granted	*	to	nonunion	workers	.
For	private-sector	union	workers	,	the	cost	of	wages	and	benefits	rose	0.9	%	in	the	third	quarter	.
For	nonunion	workers	,	the	costs	rose	1.4	%	.
Labor	costs	continued	*-1	to	rise	more	rapidly	in	service	industries	than	in	goods-producing	industries	,	the	report	showed	0	*T*-2	.
It	also	found	them	rising	much	more	in	the	Northeast	than	elsewhere	.
Including	employees	of	state	and	local	--	but	not	the	federal	--	governments	,	the	employment	cost	index	rose	1.6	%	in	the	third	quarter	,	compared	with	a	1.3	%	rise	in	the	same	quarter	in	1988	.
The	index	rose	1.1	%	in	the	second	quarter	.
For	the	12	months	ended	*	in	September	,	this	index	was	up	5.1	%	.
It	rose	4.8	%	for	the	12	months	ended	*	in	June	and	4.7	%	in	the	12	months	ended	*	in	September	1988	.
Unlike	most	economic	indicators	,	none	of	these	figures	are	adjusted	*-1	for	seasonal	variations	.
DeSoto	Inc.	said	0	it	is	dismissing	200	employees	as	part	of	a	restructuring	aimed	*	at	*	producing	pretax	savings	of	$	10	million	*U*	annually	.
Under	the	plan	,	DeSoto	said	0	it	will	sell	certain	assets	and	businesses	that	*T*-50	do	n't	meet	strategic	and	profitability	objectives	.
The	Des	Plaines	,	Ill.	,	chemical	coatings	concern	,	which	*T*-51	has	about	2,000	employees	world-wide	,	said	0	it	plans	*-1	to	sell	its	domestic	rigid	container	packaging	and	flexible	adhesives	businesses	,	and	its	Chicago	Heights	,	Ill.	,	resin	plant	.
The	company	said	0	it	plans	*-1	to	use	the	sale	proceeds	*-2	to	invest	in	business	opportunities	more	closely	identified	*	with	the	company	's	``	refocused	direction	.
StatesWest	Airlines	,	Phoenix	,	Ariz.	,	said	0	it	withdrew	its	offer	*	to	acquire	Mesa	Airlines	because	the	Farmington	,	N.M.	,	carrier	did	n't	respond	to	its	offer	by	the	close	of	business	yesterday	,	a	deadline	0	StatesWest	had	set	*T*-1	for	a	response	.
However	,	StatesWest	is	n't	abandoning	its	pursuit	of	the	much-larger	Mesa	.
StatesWest	,	which	*T*-52	has	a	7.25	%	stake	in	Mesa	,	said	0	it	may	purchase	more	Mesa	stock	or	make	a	tender	offer	directly	to	Mesa	shareholders	.
StatesWest	had	proposed	*	acquiring	Mesa	for	$	7	*U*	a	share	and	one	share	of	a	new	series	of	StatesWest	6	%	convertible	preferred	stock	0	it	values	*T*-2	at	$	3	*U*	a	share	.
Earlier	,	Mesa	had	rejected	a	general	proposal	*ICH*-1	from	StatesWest	*	to	combine	the	two	carriers	in	some	way	.
StatesWest	serves	10	cities	in	California	,	Arizona	and	Nevada	.
Mesa	flies	to	42	cities	in	New	Mexico	,	Arizona	,	Wyoming	,	Colorado	and	Texas	.
A	shiny	new	takeover	deal	sparked	a	big	rally	in	stock	prices	,	which	*T*-53	buoyed	the	dollar	.
Bond	prices	also	edged	higher	.
Georgia-Pacific	's	$	3.18	billion	*U*	bid	for	Great	Northern	Nekoosa	helped	*-1	drive	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	up	41.60	points	,	to	2645.08	,	in	active	trading	.
The	dollar	drew	strength	from	the	stock	market	's	climb	.
Long-term	bond	prices	rose	despite	trepidation	about	what	a	key	economic	report	will	show	*T*-1	today	.
Analysts	said	0	the	offer	for	Great	Northern	Nekoosa	broke	the	pall	that	*T*-54	settled	over	the	takeover	business	for	the	past	three	weeks	in	the	wake	of	the	collapsed	UAL	Corp	.	buy-out	.
Great	Northern	Nekoosa	soared	$	20.125	*U*	a	share	,	to	$	62.875	*U*	,	substantially	above	the	$	58	*U*	a	share	0	Georgia-Pacific	is	offering	*T*-1	.
That	indicates	0	speculators	are	betting	0	a	higher	offer	is	in	the	wings	.
Prices	of	other	paper	makers	rose	sharply	,	although	Georgia-Pacific	fell	$	2.50	*U*	a	share	,	to	$	50.875	*U*	.
Despite	all	the	furor	over	program	trading	,	program	trading	played	a	big	role	in	yesterday	's	rally	.
Some	traders	point	out	that	as	the	big	brokerage	firms	back	out	of	program	trading	for	their	own	accounts	or	for	clients	,	opportunities	*ICH*-1	increase	for	others	to	engage	in	the	controversial	practice	.
That	's	what	*T*-55	happened	yesterday	.
The	rally	notwithstanding	,	there	are	plenty	of	worries	about	the	short-term	course	of	stock	prices	.
A	slowing	economy	and	its	effect	on	corporate	earnings	is	the	foremost	concern	of	many	traders	and	analysts	.
Unless	the	Federal	Reserve	eases	interest	rates	soon	*	to	stimulate	the	economy	,	profits	could	remain	disappointing	.
Yesterday	's	major	economic	news	--	a	0.2	%	rise	in	the	September	index	of	leading	economic	indicators	--	had	little	impact	on	financial	markets	.
But	the	next	important	piece	of	news	on	the	economy	's	health	--	this	morning	's	release	of	the	national	purchasing	manager	's	survey	for	October	--	could	prompt	investors	into	action	.
A	report	*ICH*-1	late	yesterday	that	the	Chicago-area	purchasing	managers	survey	showed	increased	economic	activity	in	that	part	of	the	country	cut	into	bond-price	gains	.
If	the	national	survey	confirms	a	pickup	in	the	manufacturing	sector	,	it	could	further	depress	bond	prices	while	*-1	bolstering	stock	prices	and	the	dollar	.
Meanwhile	,	bond	investors	are	laboring	under	the	onus	of	a	national	debt	ceiling	debate	.
Although	the	Treasury	is	expected	*-1	to	announce	details	of	its	November	quarterly	refunding	operation	today	,	the	Nov.	79	schedule	could	be	delayed	*-2	unless	Congress	and	the	president	act	soon	*-4	to	lift	the	nation	's	debt	ceiling	.
In	major	market	activity	:
Stock	prices	rallied	in	active	trading	.
Volume	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	totaled	176.1	million	shares	.
Advancing	issues	on	the	Big	Board	surged	ahead	of	decliners	1,111	to
Bond	prices	rose	.
The	Treasury	's	benchmark	30-year	bond	gained	less	than	a	quarter	of	a	point	,	or	less	than	$	2.50	*U*	for	each	$	1,000	*U*	of	face	amount	.
The	yield	on	the	issue	slipped	to	7.91	%	.
The	dollar	gained	against	most	foreign	currencies	.
In	late	afternoon	New	York	trading	,	the	dollar	was	at	1.8415	marks	and	142.85	yen	compared	with	1.8340	marks	and	141.90	yen	late	Monday	.
Bouygues	S.A.	,	a	diversified	construction	concern	based	*	in	Paris	,	said	0	its	consolidated	profit	for	the	1989	first	half	,	after	payments	to	minority	interests	,	surged	to	188	million	French	francs	-LRB-	$	30.2	million	*U*	-RRB-	from	65	million	francs	a	year	earlier	.
Revenue	rose	21	%	to	22.61	billion	francs	from	18.69	billion	francs	.
The	company	did	n't	specify	reasons	for	the	strong	earnings	gain	.
But	Bouygues	said	0	its	first-half	profit	is	n't	indicative	of	the	full-year	trend	because	of	the	highly	seasonal	nature	of	many	of	the	company	's	activities	.
For	all	of	1988	,	Bouygues	had	consolidated	profit	of	519	million	francs	,	after	payments	to	minority	interests	,	on	revenue	of	50	billion	francs	.
The	group	has	forecast	1989	revenue	of	56.9	billion	francs	.
QVC	Network	Inc.	said	0	it	completed	its	acquisition	of	CVN	Cos.	for	about	$	423	million	*U*	.
QVC	agreed	*-1	to	pay	$	19	*U*	and	one-eighth	QVC	share	for	each	of	CVN	's	20	million	fully	diluted	shares	.
The	acquisition	brings	together	the	two	largest	competitors	to	Home	Shopping	Network	Inc.	,	which	now	*T*-56	reaches	more	viewers	than	any	other	company	in	the	video	shopping	industry	.
Among	them	,	Home	Shopping	,	QVC	and	CVN	already	control	most	of	that	young	and	fast-growing	market	,	which	last	year	*T*-57	had	sales	of	about	$	1.4	billion	*U*	.
Coast	Savings	Financial	Inc.	reported	a	third-quarter	loss	,	*-1	citing	a	previously	announced	capital	restructuring	program	.
The	Los	Angeles	thrift	holding	company	said	0	it	had	a	loss	of	$	92.2	million	*U*	,	or	$	6.98	*U*	a	share	,	for	the	quarter	ended	*	Sept.	30	.
Coast	earned	$	10.2	million	*U*	,	or	67	cents	a	share	,	in	the	year-ago	quarter	.
The	year-ago	results	have	been	restated	*-1	to	comply	with	government	regulations	.
The	restructuring	program	is	designed	*-1	to	increase	the	company	's	tangible	capital	ratio	.
It	includes	*	removing	$	242	million	*U*	in	good	will	from	the	books	,	issuing	$	150	million	*U*	in	preferred	stock	and	commencing	an	exchange	offer	for	$	52	million	*U*	in	convertible	bonds	.
During	the	third	quarter	,	the	company	charged	about	$	46	million	*U*	against	earnings	in	*	reducing	goodwill	,	added	$	20	million	*U*	to	its	general	loan	loss	reserves	and	established	a	$	30	million	*U*	reserve	for	its	high-yield	bond	portfolio	.
The	company	said	0	its	junk-bond	portfolio	after	these	moves	had	been	reduced	*-1	to	less	than	1	%	of	assets	.
Philip	Morris	Cos.	is	launching	a	massive	corporate	advertising	campaign	that	*T*-58	will	put	the	tobacco	giant	's	name	in	TV	commercials	for	the	first	time	since	the	early	1950s	,	when	it	stopped	*-2	advertising	its	namesake	cigarette	brand	on	television	*T*-1	.
The	campaign	,	a	patriotic	celebration	of	the	200th	anniversary	of	the	Bill	of	Rights	,	does	n't	mention	cigarettes	or	smoking	;	cigarette	ads	have	been	prohibited	on	television	since	1971	.
But	even	before	it	begins	,	the	campaign	is	drawing	fire	from	anti-smoking	advocates	,	who	*T*-59	criticize	Philip	Morris	's	attempt	*	to	bolster	its	beleaguered	image	by	*	wrapping	itself	in	the	document	that	*T*-60	is	a	cornerstone	of	American	democracy	.
Philip	Morris	,	which	*T*-61	became	the	U.S.	's	largest	food	company	last	year	with	its	$	12.9	billion	*U*	acquisition	of	Kraft	Inc.	,	seems	determined	*-1	to	evolve	beyond	its	roots	in	Marlboro	country	.
The	company	's	research	suggests	that	its	name	recognition	among	most	consumers	remains	unusually	low	,	although	its	array	of	brands	--	including	Maxwell	House	coffee	,	Jell-O	,	Cheez	Whiz	,	and	Miller	beer	--	blanket	supermarket	shelves	.
The	company	is	expected	*-1	to	spend	about	$	30	million	*U*	a	year	on	its	two-year	corporate	campaign	,	created	*	by	WPP	Group	's	Ogilvy	&	Mather	unit	in	New	York	.
The	initial	spots	will	appear	during	morning	and	prime-time	news	shows	.
Philip	Morris	hopes	that	by	*	taking	its	Bill	of	Rights	theme	to	the	airwaves	,	in	addition	to	publications	,	it	will	reach	the	broadest	possible	audience	.
Until	now	,	its	corporate	ads	,	mainly	promoting	its	sponsorship	of	the	arts	,	have	appeared	almost	exclusively	in	newspapers	and	magazines	.
``	Most	people	--	whether	in	Toledo	,	Tucson	or	Topeka	--	have	n't	got	a	clue	who	we	are	*T*-62	,	''	says	*T*-1	Guy	L.	Smith	,	Philip	Morris	's	vice	president	of	corporate	affairs	.
``	If	they	think	well	of	the	company	through	our	support	of	the	Bill	of	Rights	,	it	*EXP*-1	follows	0	they	'll	think	well	of	our	products	.	''
Mr.	Smith	says	0	the	Bill	of	Rights	commercial	,	which	*T*-63	trumpets	the	themes	of	liberty	and	freedom	of	expression	,	is	n't	designed	*-1	to	have	any	special	appeal	for	smokers	.
Although	Philip	Morris	typically	tries	*-1	to	defend	the	rights	of	smokers	with	free-choice	arguments	,	``	this	has	nothing	0	*	to	do	*T*-3	with	cigarettes	,	nor	will	it	ever	*?*	,	''	the	spokesman	says	0	*T*-2	.
But	some	anti-smoking	activists	disagree	,	*-1	expressing	anger	at	what	they	see	*T*-64	as	the	company	's	attempt	*	to	purchase	innocence	by	association	.
``	I	'm	outraged	because	this	company	is	portraying	itself	at	the	heart	of	American	culture	and	political	freedom	and	in	fact	it	's	a	killer	,	''	says	*T*-1	Michael	Pertschuk	,	former	chairman	of	the	Federal	Trade	Commission	and	a	tobacco-industry	critic	.
``	It	should	be	treated	*-1	like	the	Medellin	-LCB-	drug	-RCB-	mafia	,	not	the	Founding	Fathers	.	''
Mr.	Pertschuk	adds	that	the	new	commercial	dovetails	perfectly	with	major	aspects	of	Philip	Morris	's	political	strategy	.

Many	marketers	say	0	Philip	Morris	's	approach	will	be	effective	,	but	they	agree	that	the	ads	'	implied	smoking	message	is	unmistakable	.
``	This	is	clever	,	subliminal	advertising	that	really	*T*-65	says	,	`	Smokers	have	rights	,	too	,	'	''	says	*T*-1	Al	Ries	,	chairman	of	Trout	&	Ries	Inc.	,	a	Greenwich	,	Conn.	,	marketing	strategy	firm	.
``	This	is	designed	*-1	to	get	the	wagons	in	a	circle	and	defend	the	smoking	franchise	.	''

RJR	Nabisco	Inc.	and	American	Brands	Inc.	say	0	they	have	no	plans	*	to	follow	Philip	Morris	's	lead	.

Technology	stocks	woke	up	,	*	helping	the	over-the-counter	market	rise	from	its	recent	doldrums	.
The	Nasdaq	Composite	Index	surged	4.26	,	or	about	0.94	%	,	to	455.63	.
It	was	the	market	's	biggest	gain	since	*	rising	more	than	7	points	on	Oct.	19	.
Advancing	OTC	stocks	outpaced	decliners	by	1,120	to	806	.
But	the	move	lagged	a	stronger	rise	in	New	York	Stock	Exchange	issues	.
The	Big	Board	's	composite	index	was	up	more	than	1.4	%	,	and	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	jumped	1.6	%	.
Nasdaq	's	gain	was	led	*-1	by	its	biggest	industrial	stocks	.
The	Nasdaq	100	rose	7.08	to	445.23	.
The	Financial	Index	of	100	biggest	banks	and	insurance	issues	added	2.19	to	447.76	.
Other	strong	sectors	were	indicated	*-1	in	gains	of	the	Transportation	Index	,	up	7.55	to	475.35	,	and	the	Utility	Index	,	up	8.68	to	730.37	.
National	Market	System	volume	improved	to	94,425,000	shares	from	71.7	million	Monday	.
Many	of	Nasdaq	's	biggest	technology	stocks	were	in	the	forefront	of	the	rally	.
Microsoft	added	2	1\/8	to	81	3\/4	and	Oracle	Systems	rose	1	1\/2	to	23	1\/4	.
Intel	was	up	1	3\/8	to	33	3\/4	.
But	traders	who	*T*-68	watch	the	stocks	warned	0	the	rise	may	be	yet	another	``	one-day	phenomenon	.	''
Technology	stocks	bore	the	brunt	of	the	OTC	market	's	recent	sell-off	,	and	traders	say	0	it	*EXP*-1	's	natural	that	they	rebound	sharply	now	that	the	market	has	turned	around	.
But	,	they	caution	*T*-2	,	conservative	investors	would	do	well	*-1	to	sell	into	the	strength	.
``	They	are	always	the	first	0	*T*-2	to	be	sold	*-1	when	people	are	taking	profits	*T*-3	,	because	people	are	most	scared	of	the	high-technology	stocks	,	''	said	*T*-4	Robin	West	,	director	of	research	for	Ladenburg	Thalmann	's	Lanyi	division	,	which	*T*-69	specializes	in	emerging	growth	stocks	.
The	technology	group	includes	many	of	the	OTC	market	's	biggest	stocks	,	which	*T*-70	dominate	the	market-weighted	Nasdaq	Composite	Index	.
Analysts	say	0	rallies	in	the	group	historically	have	lifted	the	market	,	while	weakness	in	the	sector	often	sank	unlisted	share	prices	broadly	.
But	increasing	volatility	in	the	sector	has	exhausted	investors	who	*T*-71	try	*-1	to	follow	its	dips	and	swings	.
The	stocks	have	been	pummeled	*-1	repeatedly	by	inventory	gluts	and	disappointing	earnings	as	the	industry	matures	and	slows	.
Some	even	claim	0	the	group	has	become	a	lagging	,	not	leading	,	indicator	.
The	technology	sector	of	the	Dow	Jones	Equity	Market	Index	has	risen	only	about	6.24	%	this	year	,	while	the	Nasdaq	Composite	Index	has	gained	18.35	%	.
While	the	composite	index	lost	less	than	a	third	of	its	year-to-date	gains	in	the	market	's	recent	decline	,	the	technology	group	's	gains	were	more	than	halved	.
The	OTC	technology	sector	is	far	from	a	cohesive	unit	.
The	group	is	divided	*-1	primarily	between	software	,	semiconductors	and	computers	.
While	computer	stocks	have	taken	the	biggest	hit	from	the	slowdown	in	the	industry	,	many	software	and	semiconductor	stocks	have	continued	*-1	to	outperform	the	market	.
Microsoft	is	up	more	than	50	%	this	year	,	while	Intel	is	up	more	than	40	%	.
The	technology	group	is	also	split	between	large	companies	and	small	,	with	the	biggest	stocks	trading	as	blue-chip	issues	in	the	institutional	marketplace	,	while	the	smaller	stocks	churn	on	their	individual	merits	or	faults	,	analysts	say	*T*-1	.
The	volatility	of	smaller	technology	companies	has	served	the	group	well	overall	in	recent	stock	trading	,	according	to	Hambrecht	&	Quist	's	technology	stock	indexes	.
The	brokerage	firm	tracks	technology	stocks	with	its	Technology	Index	,	which	*T*-72	appreciated	only	10.59	%	in	the	first	nine	months	of	this	year	.
But	the	firm	also	tracks	smaller	technology	companies	as	a	subset	of	the	larger	group	.
That	index	,	which	*T*-73	contains	technology	companies	with	annual	revenues	of	$	200	million	*U*	or	less	,	gained	17.97	%	by	Sept.	30	this	year	--	*	still	lagging	the	S&P	500	,	but	leading	larger	technology	firms	.
Yesterday	,	bank	stocks	lagged	behind	the	overall	OTC	market	.
The	Nasdaq	Bank	Index	rose	0.17	to	432.78	.
George	Jennison	,	who	*T*-74	trades	bank	stocks	for	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	,	said	0	the	stocks	tend	*-1	to	fall	behind	because	they	are	n't	traded	as	much	as	many	other	issues	.
But	,	he	added	0	*T*-1	,	interest-rate-sensitive	stocks	in	general	are	stalled	*-2	.
``	The	interest-rate	sensitives	are	n't	rallying	with	the	rest	of	the	market	because	of	fears	about	what	the	-LRB-	Federal	Reserve	-RRB-	will	do	,	''	Mr.	Jennison	said	*T*-1	.
He	said	that	investors	will	scour	the	October	employment	report	,	due	out	Friday	,	for	clues	about	the	direction	of	the	economy	and	the	immediate	outlook	for	interest	rates	.
On	the	other	hand	,	Mr.	Jennison	noted	that	the	recent	slide	in	bank	and	thrift	stocks	was	at	least	halted	*-1	yesterday	.
Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	gave	small	investors	some	welcome	news	by	*-1	announcing	that	it	would	no	longer	handle	index-arbitrage-related	program	trades	for	its	accounts	.
Shearson	,	with	its	in-house	order	execution	system	,	has	handled	the	bulk	of	such	program	trades	in	the	over-the-counter	market	.
The	trading	has	been	blamed	*-1	for	much	of	the	market	's	recent	volatility	.
Jaguar	topped	the	most-active	list	,	as	its	American	depository	receipts	climbed	1	3\/4	to	13	5\/8	with	more	than	6.6	million	ADRs	traded	*-1	.
Britain	said	0	it	would	waive	its	``	golden	share	''	in	the	luxury	auto	maker	if	shareholders	vote	*-1	to	allow	a	suitor	to	acquire	more	than	15	%	of	the	company	.
The	announcement	effectively	removes	the	British	government	as	an	impediment	to	a	takeover	of	the	company	,	which	*T*-75	is	being	stalked	*-1	by	General	Motors	and	Ford	.
Gen-Probe	was	another	active	takeover	stock	.
It	surged	2	3\/4	to	6	on	volume	of	more	than	1.7	million	shares	after	the	company	agreed	*-1	to	be	acquired	*-2	by	Japan	's	Chugai	Pharmaceutical	for	about	$	110	million	*U*	--	almost	double	the	market	price	of	Gen-Probe	's	stock	.
Priam	Corp.	lost	5\/32	to	3\/32	after	*-1	filing	for	protection	from	its	creditors	under	Chapter	11	of	the	federal	Bankruptcy	Code	.
MCI	Communications	added	1	1\/2	to	43	3\/8	.
The	company	has	toted	up	over	$	40	million	*U*	in	contracts	in	the	past	two	days	.
Monday	,	MCI	announced	a	$	27	million	*U*	multiyear	contract	with	the	investment	bank	Stuart-James	.
Yesterday	,	it	received	a	$	15	million	*U*	,	three-year	contract	from	Drexel	Burnham	Lambert	.
Florida	National	Banks	of	Fla.	slid	1	1\/8	to	24	3\/4	.
Late	Monday	,	the	Federal	Reserve	Board	said	0	it	is	delaying	approval	of	First	Union	Corp.	's	proposed	$	849	million	*U*	acquisition	of	Florida	National	Banks	pending	the	outcome	of	an	examination	into	First	Union	's	lending	practices	in	low-income	heighborhoods	.
Florida	National	said	yesterday	that	it	remains	committed	to	the	merger	.
Dycom	Industries	gained	3\/4	to	16	3\/4	after	it	said	0	it	agreed	*-1	to	buy	Ansco	&	Associates	and	two	affiliates	for	cash	and	stock	.
The	value	of	the	transaction	was	n't	disclosed	*-1	.
The	companies	being	acquired	*	provide	telecommunications	services	to	the	telephone	industry	.
Willamette	Industries	,	whose	stock	*T*-76	has	suffered	steep	losses	in	recent	sessions	,	surged	1	1\/2	to	49	.
The	stock	was	one	of	many	in	the	paper	products	industry	that	*T*-77	rose	following	Georgia-Pacific	's	$	3.18	billion	*U*	bid	for	Great	Northern	Nekoosa	.
A	permanent	smoking	ban	on	virtually	all	domestic	airline	routes	won	approval	from	the	House	,	which	*T*-78	separately	sent	to	President	Bush	a	nearly	$	67	billion	*U*	fiscal	1990	bill	including	the	first	construction	funds	for	the	space	station	.
The	smoking	prohibition	remains	attached	to	a	$	27.1	billion	*U*	transportation	bill	that	*T*-79	must	still	overcome	budget	obstacles	in	Congress	.
But	yesterday	's	action	put	to	rest	any	lingering	resistance	from	tobacco	interests	.
*-2	Faced	*-1	with	inevitable	defeat	,	the	once	dominant	industry	declined	any	recorded	vote	on	the	ban	,	which	*T*-80	covers	all	but	a	fraction	of	1	%	of	daily	flights	in	the	U.S.	.
The	sole	exceptions	are	an	estimated	30	flights	of	six	hours	or	more	beginning	or	ending	in	Hawaii	and	Alaska	.
*-1	Assuming	final	enactment	this	month	,	the	prohibition	will	take	effect	96	days	later	,	or	in	early	February	.
On	a	394-21	roll	call	,	the	House	adopted	the	underlying	transportation	measure	.
But	the	bill	still	faces	budget	questions	because	it	also	is	the	vehicle	for	an	estimated	$	3.1	billion	*U*	in	supplemental	appropriations	for	law	enforcement	and	anti-drug	programs	.
The	additional	spending	pushes	the	measure	more	than	$	2	billion	*U*	above	its	prescribed	budget	ceiling	,	and	the	House	Appropriations	Committee	leadership	must	now	seek	a	waiver	in	hopes	of	*-1	completing	action	today	.
The	separate	$	67	billion	*U*	bill	sent	*	to	the	White	House	had	budget	difficulties	,	too	,	but	*-1	was	saved	*-2	ultimately	by	its	importance	to	a	broad	spectrum	of	interests	in	Congress	and	the	administration	itself	.
No	single	bill	this	year	includes	more	discretionary	spending	for	domestic	programs	and	,	apart	from	the	space	station	,	the	measure	incorporates	far-reaching	provisions	affecting	the	federal	mortgage	market	.
The	current	ceiling	on	home	loans	insured	*	by	the	Federal	Housing	Administration	is	increased	*-1	to	$	124,875	*U*	during	fiscal	1990	.
And	in	anticipation	of	increased	lending	,	the	cap	on	FHA	loan	guarantees	would	rise	to	approximately	$	73.8	billion	*U*	.
Separately	,	the	bill	gives	authority	*ICH*-1	to	the	Department	of	Housing	and	Urban	Development	*	to	facilitate	the	refinancing	of	high-interest	loans	subsidized	*	by	the	government	under	the	so-called	Section	235	home-ownership	program	for	lower-income	families	.
This	provision	met	early	and	strong	resistance	from	investment	bankers	worried	*	about	disruptions	in	their	clients	'	portfolios	.
But	the	promise	of	at	least	$	15	million	*U*	in	new	savings	helped	*-1	to	forge	a	partnership	between	HUD	Secretary	Jack	Kemp	and	lawmakers	wanting	*	to	protect	their	projects	elsewhere	.
The	estimated	$	1.8	billion	*U*	for	the	space	station	would	be	double	last	year	's	level	,	and	total	appropriations	for	the	National	Aeronautics	and	Space	Administration	would	grow	16	%	to	nearly	$	12.4	billion	*U*	.
A	string	of	costly	projects	,	including	the	high-speed	national	aerospace	plane	and	the	advanced	communications	technology	satellite	,	would	continue	*-1	to	be	developed	*-2	within	these	limits	.
And	while	*-1	imposing	a	statutory	cap	of	$	1.6	billion	*U*	on	future	spending	,	the	bill	would	give	NASA	$	30	million	*U*	for	the	start-up	of	the	CRAF-Cassini	mission	,	a	successor	to	the	Voyager	space	probe	.
Separately	,	the	National	Science	Foundation	is	promised	*-1	a	7.7	%	increase	*	to	bring	its	appropriations	to	$	2.07	billion	*U*	.
And	while	*-1	pursuing	these	initiatives	,	Congress	and	the	White	House	are	squeezed	*-1	*ICH*-2	too	by	steady	increases	--	$	551	million	*U*	--	in	veteran	's	medical	care	.
The	result	is	that	all	sides	resort	to	sleight	of	hand	*	to	make	room	for	competing	housing	and	environmental	programs	,	and	the	commitments	now	will	drive	excess	spending	into	fiscal	1991	.
Senior	members	of	the	House	Budget	Committee	are	reduced	*-1	in	frustration	to	*	raising	doomed	parliamentary	obstacles	to	individual	bills	,	yet	admit	that	much	of	the	disorder	now	stems	from	the	fiscal	legerdemain	associated	*	with	their	own	summit	agreement	with	the	White	House	this	past	spring	.
``	It	*EXP*-3	's	hard	*	to	get	the	administration	's	attention	on	anything	,	''	said	*T*-2	Rep.	Bill	Frenzel	-LRB-	R.	,	Minn.	-RRB-	,	``	because	the	whole	agreement	was	built	*-1	on	gimmickry	.	''
Among	the	subsidies	continued	*	in	the	transportation	bill	is	*T*-1	$	30.7	million	*U*	0	*	to	maintain	commercial	air	service	*T*-2	for	an	estimated	92	communities	,	often	in	rural	areas	.
Senate	Appropriations	Committee	Chairman	Robert	Byrd	-LRB-	D.	,	W.Va	.	-RRB-	strongly	resisted	deeper	cuts	sought	*	by	the	House	.
But	at	a	time	when	the	White	House	wants	*-2	to	kill	the	entire	program	*T*-1	,	Republicans	have	been	among	its	leading	champions	.
Sen.	Pete	Domenici	-LRB-	R.	,	N.M.	-RRB-	,	the	ranking	Republican	on	the	Senate	Budget	Committee	,	used	his	influence	*-1	to	preserve	more	than	$	132,000	*U*	in	subsidies	for	air	service	to	Sante	Fe	,	N.M.	,	and	more	than	$	2.1	million	*U*	would	go	for	service	to	eight	communities	in	the	western	Nebraska	district	of	GOP	Rep.	Virginia	Smith	on	the	House	Appropriations	Committee	.
GP	Express	,	an	independent	airline	serving	much	of	Nebraska	,	estimates	that	nearly	40	%	of	its	revenues	come	from	the	subsidies	that	*T*-1	,	in	some	cases	,	exceed	the	cost	of	a	ticket	.
For	example	,	a	passenger	can	fly	from	Chardon	,	Neb.	,	to	Denver	for	as	little	as	$	89	to	$	109	*U*	,	according	to	prices	quoted	*	by	the	company	.
But	given	the	few	number	of	users	,	the	cost	to	the	federal	government	per	passenger	is	estimated	*-1	at	$	193	*U*	,	according	to	House	and	Senate	appropriations	committees	.
The	House	action	yesterday	came	as	the	Senate	remained	mired	in	difficulties	over	a	$	17.25	billion	*U*	measure	covering	the	budgets	for	the	State	,	Commerce	,	and	Justice	departments	in	fiscal	1990	.
The	compromise	bill	passed	the	House	last	week	but	*-1	has	now	provoked	jurisdictional	fights	with	the	Senate	Foreign	Relations	Committee	,	which	*T*-81	jealously	protects	its	prerogatives	over	operations	at	the	State	Department	.
The	same	jealousy	can	breed	confusion	,	however	,	in	the	absence	of	any	authorization	bill	this	year	.
House	and	Senate	appropriators	sought	*-1	to	establish	a	Nov.	30	deadline	after	which	their	bill	would	become	the	last	word	on	how	funds	are	distributed	*T*-3	*T*-2	.
But	on	a	53-45	roll	call	this	provision	was	stripped	*-1	from	the	bill	last	night	after	Foreign	Relations	Chairman	Claiborne	Pell	-LRB-	D.	,	R.I	.	-RRB-	complained	that	it	was	an	intrusion	on	exclusive	powers	vested	*	in	his	panel	for	more	than	three	decades	.
Coda	Energy	Inc.	said	0	it	arranged	a	$	50	million	*U*	credit	facility	with	NCNB	Texas	National	Bank	,	a	unit	of	NCNB	Corp.	,	of	Charlotte	,	N.C	.
The	Dallas	oil	and	gas	concern	said	that	$	10	million	*U*	of	the	facility	would	be	used	*-1	*-3	to	consolidate	the	company	's	$	8.1	million	*U*	of	existing	bank	debt	,	to	repurchase	4	million	of	its	4.9	million	shares	outstanding	of	Series	D	convertible	preferred	stock	,	and	to	purchase	a	10	%	net-profits	interest	in	certain	oil	and	gas	properties	from	one	of	its	existing	lenders	,	National	Canada	Corp	.
The	remaining	$	40	million	*U*	can	be	used	*-1	over	three	years	for	oil	and	gas	acquisitions	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-2	.
Ted	Eubank	,	Coda	's	president	,	said	0	the	loan	carries	an	interest	rate	of	prime	plus	one	percentage	point	,	with	85	%	of	the	company	's	net	oil	and	gas	revenue	each	month	dedicated	*	to	repayment	.
The	company	put	up	``	virtually	all	''	of	its	oil	and	gas	properties	as	collateral	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
General	Dynamics	Corp.	was	given	*-1	an	$	843	million	*U*	Air	Force	contract	for	F-16	aircraft	and	related	equipment	.
Loral	Corp.	's	defense	systems	division	received	a	$	54.9	million	*U*	Air	Force	contract	for	a	F-15	weapons	system	trainer	.
Southern	Air	Transport	Inc.	won	$	47.5	million	*U*	in	Air	Force	and	Navy	contracts	for	transportation	services	.
International	Business	Machines	Corp.	was	given	*-1	a	$	31.2	million	*U*	Air	Force	contract	for	satellite	data	systems	equipment	.
Directed	Technologies	received	a	$	28.3	million	*U*	Defense	Advanced	Research	Projects	Agency	contract	for	advanced	propulsion	systems	research	.
Propper	International	Inc.	got	a	$	22.8	million	*U*	Defense	Logistics	Agency	contract	for	combat	camouflage	trousers	.
Santa	Fe	Pacific	was	the	kind	of	story	0	Wall	Street	loved	*T*-1	.
Since	the	value	of	its	assets	was	n't	known	*-1	,	analysts	were	free	*-2	to	pick	a	number	.
In	one	of	many	rosy	scenarios	,	Bear	Stearns	's	Gary	Schneider	wrote	in	March	that	its	real	estate	alone	had	a	value	of	$	4.5	billion	*U*	.
*	Throw	in	its	railroad	,	minerals	,	pipeline	and	oil	assets	,	he	and	others	argued	*T*-1	,	and	the	Chicago-based	conglomerate	should	be	worth	30	a	share	.
And	why	should	holders	expect	*-1	to	realize	that	presumed	``	worth	?	''
That	was	another	reason	0	the	Street	loved	Santa	Fe	*T*-1	.
With	real	estate	experts	Olympia	&	York	and	Samuel	Zell	's	Itel	owning	close	to	40	%	of	Santa	Fe	's	stock	,	management	was	under	pressure	--	in	a	favored	phrase	of	Wall	Street	--	*-1	to	quickly	``	maximize	values	.	''
But	value	,	it	turns	out	0	*T*-1	,	is	only	what	a	buyer	will	pay	*T*-82	.
And	with	the	company	's	recent	announcement	that	it	is	contemplating	a	partial	sale	of	its	real	estate	,	the	values	suddenly	look	poorer	.
Santa	Fe	has	disclosed	that	it	is	negotiating	*-1	to	sell	a	20	%	interest	in	its	real	estate	unit	to	the	California	Public	Employees	Retirement	System	for	roughly	$	400	million	*U*	.
Since	the	real	estate	unit	also	includes	debt	,	the	imputed	value	of	the	real	estate	itself	is	close	to	$	3	billion	*U*	.
``	The	implied	current	net	asset	value	of	22.70	-LCB-	per	share	-RCB-	is	well	below	the	30	level	that	the	Street	believed	*T*-83	,	''	PaineWebber	says	*T*-1	.
``	The	upside	was	in	the	intangible	real	estate	...	which	*T*-84	is	no	longer	an	intangible	.	''
So	what	is	Santa	Fe	worth	*T*-1	?
If	the	railroad	is	valued	*-1	on	a	private	market	basis	--	at	the	same	multiple	of	earnings	as	in	the	recent	sale	of	CNW	--	it	would	have	a	value	of	$	1.65	billion	*U*	.
A	compromise	between	bulls	and	bears	puts	remaining	assets	and	cash	--	including	its	44	%	stake	in	its	publicly	traded	pipeline	--	at	$	2	billion	*U*	.
Santa	Fe	also	has	$	3.7	billion	*U*	in	debt	.
In	addition	,	its	railroad	lost	a	$	750	million	*U*	antitrust	suit	,	which	*T*-85	is	on	appeal	,	and	which	analysts	say	0	*T*-86	could	be	settled	*-1	for	one-third	that	amount	.
That	nets	out	to	about	$	17	*U*	a	share	for	the	company	on	a	private	market	basis	.
But	Santa	Fe	,	currently	trading	at	18	7\/8	,	is	n't	likely	*-1	to	realize	private	market	values	by	*-2	selling	assets	,	because	the	tax	against	it	would	be	onerous	.
Its	plan	,	instead	,	is	*-1	to	spin	off	the	remainder	of	its	real	estate	unit	and	to	possibly	do	the	same	with	its	mining	and	energy	assets	.
Robert	D.	Krebs	,	Santa	Fe	's	chairman	,	argues	that	since	its	businesses	are	valued	in	different	ways	,	``	the	sum	of	the	parts	may	be	greater	than	the	whole	.	''
But	it	*EXP*-1	is	n't	clear	why	that	should	be	so	*T*-2	.
The	spinoff	argument	,	after	all	,	reverses	the	current	notion	that	assets	are	worth	more	to	private	buyers	than	to	public	shareholders	.
And	real	estate	usually	has	n't	traded	well	under	public	ownership	.
Salomon	Brothers	says	,	``	We	believe	0	the	real	estate	properties	would	trade	at	a	discount	...	after	the	realty	unit	is	spun	off	...	.
And	what	about	the	cost	,	and	risk	,	of	*	waiting	*-1	to	realize	the	hypothetical	private	market	values	?	''
Some	analysts	remain	bullish	.
Mr.	Schneider	of	Bear	Stearns	says	0	he	is	recalculating	the	worth	of	the	company	's	assets	and	,	in	the	meantime	,	is	sticking	to	his	``	buy	''	recommendation	on	the	belief	that	he	will	find	``	values	''	of	30	a	share	.
He	adds	:	``	If	for	any	reason	I	do	n't	have	the	values	,	then	I	wo	n't	recommend	it	.	''
First	Boston	's	Graeme	Anne	Lidgerwood	values	Santa	Fe	at	24	,	down	from	her	earlier	estimate	of	29	.
Her	recent	report	classifies	the	stock	as	a	``	hold	.	''
But	it	appears	*-1	to	be	the	sort	of	hold	0	one	makes	*T*-2	while	*-3	heading	for	the	door	.
*	Quoting	from	the	report	:	``	The	stock	's	narrow	discount	to	asset	valuation	makes	it	a	relatively	unappealing	investment	at	current	prices	,	especially	given	the	risk	that	our	projections	could	be	on	the	aggressive	side	.	''
Chairman	Krebs	says	0	the	California	pension	fund	is	getting	a	bargain	price	that	*T*-87	would	n't	have	been	offered	*-1	to	others	.
In	other	words	:	The	real	estate	has	a	higher	value	than	the	pending	deal	suggests	*?*	.
Since	most	of	the	unit	's	real	estate	is	in	California	,	the	pension	fund	will	be	a	useful	political	ally	in	a	state	where	development	is	often	held	*-2	hostage	to	zoning	boards	*T*-1	.
And	,	as	Mr.	Zell	says	*T*-2	,	with	Itel	and	O&Y	on	the	unit	's	board	,	the	real	estate	will	be	run	*-1	by	``	a	very	unusual	group	''	*	to	say	the	least	.
It	*EXP*-1	is	possible	then	that	Santa	Fe	's	real	estate	--	even	in	a	state	imperiled	*	by	earthquakes	--	could	,	one	day	,	fetch	a	king	's	ransom	.
But	as	Drexel	analyst	Linda	Dunn	*T*-1	notes	,	its	properties	will	be	developed	*-2	over	15	to	20	years	.
So	despite	Wall	Street	's	rosy	talk	of	*	quickly	``	maximizing	values	,	''	holders	could	be	in	for	a	long	wait	.

The	acceptances	give	Orkem	a	controlling	53.2	%	stake	in	the	company	.
Orkem	and	Coates	said	last	Wednesday	that	the	two	were	considering	a	merger	,	through	Orkem	's	British	subsidiary	,	Orkem	Coatings	U.K.	Ltd	.
Orkem	,	France	's	third-largest	chemical	group	,	said	0	it	would	fund	the	acquisition	through	internal	resources	.

But	Asher	B.	Edelman	,	who	*T*-89	controls	about	16	%	of	the	San	Antonio	,	Texas	,	computer-servicing	company	,	insisted	that	the	announcement	did	n't	have	anything	0	*	to	do	*T*-1	with	the	ongoing	battle	for	control	of	Datapoint	Corp	.
Any	sale	of	Intelogic	could	have	an	impact	on	the	battle	between	Mr.	Edelman	and	New	York	attorney	Martin	Ackerman	for	control	of	Datapoint	.
Intelogic	holds	27.5	%	of	Datapoint	's	common	shares	outstanding	.
Mr.	Edelman	said	0	the	decision	``	has	nothing	0	*	to	do	*T*-1	with	Marty	Ackerman	.	''
Mr.	Ackerman	contended	that	it	was	a	direct	response	to	his	efforts	*	to	gain	control	of	Datapoint	.

Federal	and	state	thrift	examiners	said	0	they	saw	evidence	of	criminal	wrongdoing	in	the	collapse	of	Lincoln	Savings	&	Loan	Association	,	and	a	California	regulator	described	an	attempted	``	whitewash	''	by	deputies	of	chief	federal	regulator	Danny	Wall	.
In	a	riveting	day	of	hearings	before	the	House	Banking	Committee	,	the	examiners	described	*	finding	shredded	documents	,	a	mysterious	Panamanian	subsidiary	,	millions	of	dollars	funneled	*	into	a	Swiss	bank	,	and	a	complacent	attitude	by	Mr.	Wall	's	deputies	,	one	of	whom	*T*-1	was	portrayed	*-2	as	*	acting	more	like	a	public-relations	man	for	the	thrift	than	a	federal	regulator	.
A	California	official	also	said	0	he	sent	the	Federal	Bureau	of	Investigation	a	packet	of	documents	relating	to	a	previously	reported	$	400,000	*U*	contribution	from	Lincoln	's	parent	solicited	*	by	Sen.	Alan	Cranston	-LRB-	D.	,	Calif	.	-RRB-	.
Federal	examiner	Alex	Barabolak	said	0	Lincoln	's	operations	amounted	to	``	*	pyramiding	debt	*	to	provide	a	luxurious	life	style	for	its	owners	.	''
Another	federal	examiner	,	John	Meek	,	said	0	Lincoln	's	principal	owner	,	Charles	Keating	Jr.	,	and	his	family	drew	off	at	least	$	34	million	*U*	from	the	thrift	in	salaries	,	bonuses	and	proceeds	from	securities	sales	in	the	3	1\/2	years	before	federal	authorities	seized	it	earlier	this	year	.
Lincoln	's	collapse	may	cost	taxpayers	as	much	as	$	2.5	billion	*U*	,	according	to	estimates	,	*	making	it	the	most	expensive	thrift	failure	in	history	.
``	I	think	0	there	's	overwhelming	evidence	0	*T*-1	to	indicate	probable	criminal	activity	,	''	said	*T*-2	Mr.	Meek	,	who	*T*-91	participated	last	year	in	an	examination	of	the	Irvine	,	Calif.	,	thrift	.
He	said	0	the	evidence	pointed	to	wrongdoing	by	Mr.	Keating	``	and	others	,	''	although	he	did	n't	allege	any	specific	violation	.
Richard	Newsom	,	a	California	state	official	who	last	year	*T*-92	examined	Lincoln	's	parent	,	American	Continental	Corp.	,	said	0	he	also	saw	evidence	that	crimes	had	been	committed	*-1	.
``	It	sure	smells	like	it	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
He	said	0	30	%	of	the	loans	0	he	sampled	*T*-1	were	``	dead	meat	on	the	day	0	they	were	made	*-3	*T*-2	.	''
The	state	examiner	also	said	0	supervisors	of	a	parallel	federal	examination	seemed	so	reluctant	*-1	to	demand	write-downs	of	Lincoln	's	bad	loans	that	he	immediately	grew	suspicious	.
``	Later	on	,	my	concerns	about	a	whitewash	became	even	more	serious	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
He	called	the	sour	loans	``	appalling	''	and	added	,	``	You	opened	the	file	up	and	it	just	jumped	at	you	.	''
Leonard	Bickwit	,	a	Washington	attorney	for	Lincoln	's	parent	corporation	,	said	in	an	interview	,	``	We	deny	any	criminal	behavior	by	the	association	or	its	officers	.	''
``	Those	who	*T*-93	testified	-LCB-	yesterday	-RCB-	have	consistently	maintained	that	anyone	who	*T*-94	did	n't	agree	with	them	is	part	of	a	coverup	,	a	whitewash	,	or	the	subject	of	excessive	influence	,	''	Mr.	Bickwit	said	*T*-1	.
``	We	simply	do	n't	agree	with	that	or	the	findings	of	their	investigation	.	''
Mr.	Wall	's	deputies	complained	that	they	had	n't	been	given	*-1	an	opportunity	*	to	respond	to	the	criticism	brought	out	during	the	Banking	Committee	's	hearings	,	which	Committee	Chairman	Henry	Gonzalez	-LRB-	D.	,	Texas	-RRB-	has	used	*T*-2	as	a	forum	*	to	flay	Mr.	Wall	's	handling	of	the	affair	and	to	demand	that	he	step	aside	from	his	job	.
``	A	couple	of	things	0	Mr.	Newsom	said	*T*-1	were	at	least	misleading	,	''	said	*T*-2	Kevin	O'Connell	,	one	of	the	Washington	regulators	responsible	for	the	handling	of	Lincoln	.
In	an	interview	,	he	said	0	federal	regulators	eventually	declared	one	of	the	loans	0	the	state	regulator	cited	*T*-1	to	be	a	total	loss	,	and	forced	Lincoln	to	make	an	$	18	million	*U*	downward	adjustment	on	another	.
``	Our	response	to	the	whitewash	would	simply	be	,	0	*	look	what	*T*-95	happened	,	''	another	Washington	official	,	Alvin	Smuzynski	,	said	*T*-1	in	an	interview	.
Federal	officials	seized	the	association	in	April	,	a	day	after	the	parent	corporation	entered	bankruptcy-law	proceedings	.
The	government	later	brought	a	$	1.1	billion	*U*	fraud	suit	against	Mr.	Keating	and	others	.
Rep.	Gonzalez	has	complained	that	regulators	waited	far	too	long	,	however	,	*-1	ignoring	a	recommendation	*ICH*-2	from	regional	officials	*	to	place	Lincoln	into	receivership	two	years	before	it	failed	.
``	He	took	the	reckless	course	of	*	ignoring	the	evidence	,	''	Rep.	Gonzalez	said	*T*-1	.
State	thrift	examiner	Eugene	Stelzer	said	0	he	found	the	chief	federal	examiner	Steve	Scott	to	be	totally	uninterested	in	one	allegedly	fraudulent	series	of	transactions	.
``	Frankly	,	it	was	like	he	worked	for	the	Lincoln	public-relations	department	,	''	Mr.	Stelzer	testified	*T*-1	.
And	David	Riley	,	a	federal	examiner	who	*T*-96	worked	under	Mr.	Scott	,	said	0	he	found	his	chief	oddly	upbeat	about	Lincoln	.

Mr.	Meek	said	that	a	day	or	two	before	Lincoln	's	parent	entered	bankruptcy	proceedings	,	he	and	other	examiners	saw	``	a	truck	with	a	sign	on	it	that	*T*-98	said	0	it	was	from	the	`	Document	Destruction	Center	.	'
We	observed	at	least	two	large	plastic	bags	of	shredded	paper	loaded	*-1	into	this	truck	.	''
Mr.	Bickwit	said	0	the	paper	had	been	donated	*-1	to	``	a	charitable	organization	that	*T*-99	sells	it	for	recycling	.
They	shredded	it	simply	because	it	contained	financial	information	about	their	creditors	and	depositors	.	''
Mr.	Meek	said	0	his	suspicions	were	aroused	*-1	by	several	foreign	investments	by	Lincoln	,	including	$	22	million	*U*	paid	*	to	Credit	Suisse	of	Switzerland	,	an	$	18	million	*U*	interest	in	Saudi	European	Bank	in	Paris	,	a	$	17.5	million	*U*	investment	in	a	Bahamas	trading	company	,	and	a	recently	discovered	holding	in	a	Panama-based	company	,	Southbrook	Holdings	.
Mr.	Bickwit	said	,	``	I	can	see	why	an	S&L	examiner	would	regard	these	as	unusual	activities	*T*-2	,	''	but	said	0	the	overseas	investments	``	essentially	broke	even	''	for	the	S&L	.
LTV	Steel	Co.	is	boosting	the	prices	of	flat	rolled	steel	products	by	an	average	of	3	%	following	a	recent	erosion	in	the	prices	of	such	crucial	steel	products	.
The	big	questions	are	whether	the	increase	,	effective	Jan.	1	,	1990	,	will	stick	,	and	whether	other	major	steelmakers	will	follow	suit	.
It	is	widely	expected	that	they	will	*?*	.
The	increase	is	on	the	base	price	,	which	*T*-100	is	already	being	discounted	*-1	by	virtually	all	steel	producers	.
But	LTV	's	move	marks	the	first	effort	*ICH*-1	by	a	major	steelmaker	*	to	counter	the	free	fall	in	spot	prices	.
Major	steel	producers	are	selling	cold	rolled	sheet	steel	at	about	$	370	*U*	a	ton	,	compared	with	a	peak	price	of	$	520	*U*	a	ton	in	1988	.
Second-tier	companies	are	receiving	even	less	per	ton	.
LTV	's	planned	increase	,	which	*T*-101	was	announced	*-1	in	an	Oct.	26	memo	to	district	managers	,	does	n't	affect	electrogalvanized	steel	or	tin	plate	.
LTV	confirmed	the	price-increase	plan	,	*-1	saying	0	the	move	is	designed	*-2	to	more	accurately	reflect	the	value	of	products	and	to	put	steel	on	more	equal	footing	with	other	commodities	.
A	spokesman	for	LTV	Steel	,	which	*T*-102	is	a	unit	of	Dallas-based	LTV	Corp.	,	noted	that	steel	prices	,	adjusted	*	for	inflation	,	increased	only	1.7	%	between	1981	and	the	fourth	quarter	of	1988	,	while	the	prices	of	other	industrial	commodities	increased	nearly	five	times	as	much	.
At	the	same	time	,	steelmakers	are	trying	*-1	to	invest	more	*-2	to	modernize	technology	and	make	themselves	more	competitive	.
But	analysts	say	0	the	company	is	also	trying	*-1	to	prevent	further	price	drops	.
Moreover	,	they	note	that	LTV	may	be	trying	*-2	*-2	to	send	a	signal	*ICH*-1	to	major	customers	,	such	as	Chrysler	Corp.	and	Whirlpool	Corp.	,	that	steelmakers	need	more	money	.
Both	companies	are	in	the	process	of	*	negotiating	contracts	with	LTV	and	others	.
``	They	-LCB-	LTV	-RCB-	may	believe	0	this	can	impact	contract	negotiations	and	is	their	signal	*ICH*-3	to	the	world	that	now	is	the	time	0	*	to	get	tough	on	prices	*T*-2	,	''	said	*T*-1	Peter	Marcus	,	an	analyst	with	PaineWebber	Inc	.
Mr.	Marcus	believes	0	spot	steel	prices	will	continue	*-1	to	fall	through	early	1990	and	then	reverse	themselves	.
He	is	n't	convinced	,	though	,	that	the	price	decline	reflects	falling	demand	because	the	world	economy	remains	relatively	strong	.
And	while	customers	such	as	steel	service	centers	are	continuing	*-1	to	reduce	inventories	through	the	fourth	quarter	,	they	eventually	will	begin	stocking	up	again	,	he	notes	0	*T*-2	.
It	*EXP*-1	wo	n't	be	clear	for	months	whether	the	price	increase	will	stick	.
Steelmakers	announced	a	round	of	base-price	increases	last	year	,	but	began	*-1	offering	sizable	discounts	over	the	summer	.
In	fact	,	LTV	was	the	first	steelmaker	0	*T*-1	to	publicly	boost	discounts	for	buyers	of	cold	rolled	sheet	steel	and	hot-dipped	galvanized	sheet	steel	.
In	composite	New	York	Stock	Exchange	trading	yesterday	,	LTV	common	shares	fell	12.5	cents	*-1	to	close	at	$	1.50	*U*	.
The	Treasury	plans	*-1	to	raise	$	2.3	billion	*U*	in	new	cash	with	the	sale	Monday	of	about	$	16	billion	*U*	in	short-term	bills	*	to	redeem	$	13.71	billion	*U*	in	maturing	bills	.
However	,	the	Treasury	said	0	it	will	postpone	the	auction	unless	it	has	assurances	of	enactment	of	legislation	0	*T*-1	to	raise	the	statutory	debt	limit	before	the	scheduled	auction	date	.
The	offering	will	be	divided	*-1	evenly	between	13-week	and	26-week	bills	maturing	on	Feb.	8	,	1990	,	and	May	10	,	1990	,	respectively	.

Twenty	years	later	,	two	California	academics	,	Stanley	Cohen	and	Herbert	Boyer	,	made	``	recombinant	''	DNA	,	*-1	transplanting	a	toad	's	gene	into	bacteria	,	which	then	*T*-104	reproduced	toad	genes	.
When	Boyer	met	Robert	Swanson	,	an	M.I.T.-trained	chemist-turned-entrepreneur	in	1976	*T*-1	,	they	saw	dollar	signs	.
With	$	500	*U*	apiece	and	an	injection	of	outside	capital	,	they	formed	Genentech	Inc	.
Commercial	gene-splicing	was	born	*-1	.
Genentech	's	first	product	,	a	brain	protein	called	*	somatostatin	,	proved	its	technology	.
The	next	0	*T*-1	to	be	cloned	*-2	,	human	insulin	,	had	market	potential	and	Genentech	licensed	it	to	Eli	Lilly	,	which	*T*-105	produced	80	%	of	the	insulin	used	*	by	1.5	million	U.S.	diabetics	.
Their	laboratory	credentials	established	*	,	Boyer	and	Swanson	headed	for	Wall	Street	in	1980	.
At	the	time	,	Genentech	had	only	one	profitable	year	behind	it	-LRB-	a	modest	$	116,000	*U*	on	revenue	of	$	2.6	million	*U*	in	1979	-RRB-	and	no	product	of	its	own	on	the	market	.
Nonetheless	,	the	$	36	million	*U*	issue	0	they	floated	*T*-1	in	1980	opened	at	$	35	*U*	and	leaped	to	$	89	*U*	within	20	minutes	.
The	trip	from	the	test	tube	was	not	without	snags	.
Boyer	and	Cohen	,	for	instance	,	both	still	university	researchers	,	had	*-1	to	be	talked	*-2	into	*	applying	for	a	patent	on	their	gene-splicing	technique	--	and	then	the	Patent	Office	refused	*-3	to	grant	it	.
That	judgment	,	in	turn	,	was	reversed	*-1	by	the	U.S.	Supreme	Court	,	*	leaving	Cohen	and	Boyer	holding	the	first	patents	for	*	making	recombinant	DNA	-LRB-	now	assigned	to	their	schools	-RRB-	.
Gene-splicing	now	is	an	integral	part	of	the	drug	business	.
Genentech	's	1988	sales	were	$	335	million	*U*	,	both	from	licensing	and	its	own	products	.
The	portfolio	unit	of	the	French	bank	group	Credit	Lyonnais	told	stock	market	regulators	that	it	bought	43,000	shares	of	Cie.	de	Navigation	Mixte	,	apparently	*	to	help	*-1	fend	off	an	unwelcome	takeover	bid	for	the	company	.
Earlier	yesterday	,	the	Societe	de	Bourses	Francaises	was	told	*-1	that	a	unit	of	Framatome	S.A.	also	bought	Navigation	Mixte	shares	,	this	purchase	covering	more	than	160,000	shares	.
Both	companies	are	allies	of	Navigation	Mixte	in	its	fight	against	a	hostile	takeover	bid	launched	*	last	week	by	Cie	.
Financiere	de	Paribas	at	1,850	French	francs	-LRB-	$	297	*U*	-RRB-	a	share	.
Navigation	Mixte	's	chairman	had	suggested	that	friendly	institutions	were	likely	*-1	to	buy	its	stock	as	soon	as	trading	opened	Monday	.
The	Credit	Lyonnais	purchase	,	for	33,000	regular	common	shares	and	10,000	newly	created	shares	,	is	valued	*-1	at	about	slightly	more	than	80	million	French	francs	.
Unocal	Corp.	,	Los	Angeles	,	said	0	it	and	Petroleos	de	Venezuela	S.A.	would	create	a	petroleum	marketing	and	refining	general	partnership	in	the	Midwest	.
The	joint	venture	,	Uno-Ven	Co.	,	would	generate	total	annual	revenue	of	about	$	500	million	*U*	and	have	1,100	employees	,	a	Unocal	spokesman	said	0	*T*-1	.
Unocal	said	0	the	venture	would	enable	it	to	recover	more	of	its	refining	and	marketing	investment	and	prepare	for	expected	growth	in	exploration	,	production	,	chemicals	and	other	areas	.
It	said	0	financing	would	consist	of	$	250	million	*U*	from	a	private	placement	obtained	*	through	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	Inc.	and	a	$	150	million	*U*	revolving	credit	line	underwritten	*	by	Chase	Manhattan	Bank	.
In	addition	to	Unocal	's	153,000	barrel-a-day	refinery	near	Lemont	,	Ill.	,	the	new	venture	would	control	17	distribution	terminals	,	a	lubricating-oil	blending	and	packaging	plant	,	and	131	company-owned	Unocal	service	stations	.
It	said	0	the	venture	,	expected	*	to	take	control	of	the	facilities	Dec.	1	,	would	also	serve	another	3,300	independent	Unocal	gasoline	stations	.
Petroleos	will	supply	135,000	barrels	of	oil	a	day	for	the	refinery	,	Unocal	said	0	*T*-1	.
Mitsubishi	Heavy	Industries	Ltd.	said	0	unconsolidated	pretax	earnings	in	the	fiscal	first	half	surged	79	%	to	a	record	63.25	billion	yen	-LRB-	$	445.7	million	*U*	-RRB-	,	*	reflecting	strong	demand	for	a	variety	of	products	.
In	the	period	ended	*	Sept.	30	,	net	income	rose	90	%	to	31.18	billion	yen	,	or	9.34	yen	a	share	,	from	16.38	billion	yen	,	or	5.05	yen	a	share	.
A	year	ago	,	the	Tokyo	company	had	pretax	profit	of	35.38	billion	yen	.
Sales	amounted	to	1.011	trillion	yen	,	*-1	climbing	29	%	from	787.02	billion	yen	.
*-2	Encouraged	*-1	by	the	brisk	performance	,	Mitsubishi	plans	*-2	to	raise	its	per-share	dividend	to	3.50	yen	from	three	yen	.
Company	officials	said	0	the	current	robust	domestic	demand	that	*T*-106	has	been	fueling	sustained	economic	expansion	helped	push	up	sales	of	products	like	ships	,	steel	structures	,	power	systems	and	machinery	and	resulted	in	sharply	higher	profit	.
Senate	leaders	traded	proposals	aimed	*	at	*	speeding	action	on	legislation	0	*T*-1	to	narrow	the	deficit	and	raise	the	federal	government	's	debt	limit	--	but	the	major	stumbling	block	remains	President	Bush	's	proposal	*	to	cut	the	capital-gains	tax	rate	.
Democrats	want	the	tax	provision	to	be	a	separate	bill	,	subject	to	the	usual	procedural	obstacles	.
Republicans	,	meanwhile	,	want	*-1	to	try	*-2	to	protect	the	measure	by	*	combining	it	with	two	politically	popular	issues	that	Democrats	could	find	*T*-107	hard	0	*-3	to	block	*T*-4	.
The	talks	between	Senate	Majority	Leader	George	Mitchell	of	Maine	and	his	GOP	counterpart	,	Sen.	Robert	Dole	of	Kansas	,	are	expected	*-1	to	resume	today	.
Last	night	,	after	*	meeting	with	Mr.	Bush	and	administration	officials	at	the	White	House	,	Mr.	Dole	proposed	*	streamlining	the	fiscal	1990	deficit-reduction	bill	,	now	stalled	in	a	House-Senate	conference	committee	,	and	passing	a	long-term	extension	of	the	federal	debt	ceiling	without	any	accompanying	amendments	.
Under	this	plan	,	two	provisions	currently	in	the	House	version	of	the	deficit-cutting	bill	--	repeal	of	both	the	catastrophic-illness	insurance	program	and	a	controversial	1986	tax	provision	intended	*	to	counter	discrimination	in	employee-benefit	plans	--	would	be	made	*	into	a	separate	bill	.
Republicans	would	try	*-1	to	attach	a	capital-gains	provision	to	that	legislation	,	*-1	hoping	0	the	political	popularity	of	its	other	two	parts	would	dissuade	Democrats	from	*	blocking	it	.
Democrats	want	*-1	to	avoid	*-2	having	*-3	to	make	that	choice	by	*	making	the	capital-gains	tax	cut	an	individual	bill	.
Sen.	Mitchell	is	confident	0	he	has	sufficient	votes	*	to	block	such	a	measure	with	procedural	actions	.
Both	plans	would	drop	child-care	provisions	from	the	House	version	of	the	deficit-reduction	legislation	and	let	it	progress	as	a	separate	bill	.
While	that	could	make	it	vulnerable	to	a	veto	by	Mr.	Bush	,	Democrats	argue	that	a	presidential	rejection	would	give	their	party	a	valuable	issue	in	next	year	's	congressional	elections	.
Senate	Democrats	are	*-1	to	meet	today	*-1	to	consider	the	GOP	proposal	.
Yesterday	,	Mr.	Dole	seemed	weary	of	the	Bush	administration	's	strategy	of	*	pushing	the	capital-gains	measure	at	every	chance	in	the	face	of	Democratic	procedural	hurdles	.
*	Pushing	the	issue	on	legislation	needed	*	*	to	avoid	default	by	the	federal	government	,	he	told	reporters	0	*T*-2	,	``	does	n't	seem	*-3	to	be	very	good	strategy	to	me	.	''
At	12:01	a.m.	EST	today	,	the	federal	government	's	temporary	$	2.87	trillion	*U*	debt	limit	expired	.
*-1	To	avoid	default	,	lawmakers	must	pass	legislation	raising	the	limit	to	$	3.12	trillion	*U*	from	$	2.80	trillion	*U*	by	next	Wednesday	,	according	to	the	Treasury	.
*-2	Pressed	*-1	by	Chairman	Dan	Rostenkowski	-LRB-	D.	,	Ill	.	-RRB-	of	the	House	Ways	and	Means	Committee	,	Treasury	Undersecretary	Robert	Glauber	told	a	congressional	hearing	that	the	administration	would	give	up	its	demand	for	the	capital-gains	tax	cut	if	*-3	faced	with	a	potential	default	.
Price	Stern	Sloan	Inc.	said	0	it	hired	an	investment	banking	firm	0	*T*-1	to	assist	in	*	evaluating	restructuring	or	merger	alternatives	and	reported	a	net	loss	of	$	8.1	million	*U*	,	or	$	2.14	*U*	a	share	,	for	the	third	quarter	ended	*	Sept	.
These	results	compare	with	net	income	of	$	1.8	million	*U*	,	or	44	cents	a	share	,	for	the	corresponding	period	last	year	.
This	quarter	's	loss	includes	pretax	charges	of	$	4.9	million	*U*	on	the	proposed	discontinuation	of	the	company	's	troubled	British	subsidiary	,	and	$	3.7	million	*U*	of	other	write-offs	0	the	company	said	0	*T*-1	were	non-recurring	and	principally	related	to	inventory	,	publishing	advances	and	pre-publication	costs	.
The	publishing	concern	said	0	it	retained	the	investment	banking	firm	of	Donaldson	,	Lufkin	&	Jenrette	Securities	Inc.	0	*T*-1	to	act	as	its	financial	adviser	,	*-2	assisting	in	the	evaluation	of	various	financial	and	strategic	alternatives	,	including	debt	refinancing	,	*	raising	capital	,	recapitalization	,	a	merger	or	sale	of	the	company	.
The	company	also	retained	attorney	Martin	P.	Levin	,	a	director	of	the	company	and	former	head	of	the	Times-Mirror	Publishing	Group	,	as	an	adviser	.
Net	sales	for	this	year	's	third	quarter	were	$	14	million	*U*	,	down	from	$	21.4	million	*U*	last	year	.
The	company	attributed	the	decrease	in	part	to	the	exclusion	of	the	company	's	British	sales	from	the	current	year	's	figures	as	a	result	of	the	subsidiary	's	status	as	a	proposed	discontinued	operation	and	,	in	part	,	to	lower	sales	in	certain	key	foreign	and	domestic	accounts	.
U.K.	sales	for	last	year	's	quarter	were	about	$	3	million	*U*	.
Stock	prices	surged	as	a	multibillion-dollar	takeover	proposal	helped	*-1	restore	market	players	'	confidence	about	the	prospects	for	further	deal-making	.
Paper	and	forest-products	stocks	were	especially	strong	,	as	the	offer	for	Great	Northern	Nekoosa	by	Georgia-Pacific	triggered	speculation	that	the	industry	could	be	in	for	a	wave	of	merger	activity	.
The	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	climbed	41.60	to	2645.08	even	though	some	late	selling	caused	the	market	to	retreat	from	session	highs	.
Trading	was	moderate	,	with	176,100,000	shares	changing	hands	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	.
Aside	from	the	takeover	news	,	big	buy	orders	were	placed	*-1	for	blue-chip	shares	in	afternoon	trading	.
Traders	said	0	the	buy	programs	came	from	very	large	institutional	accounts	that	*T*-108	were	also	active	in	the	stock-index	futures	markets	.
At	one	point	,	almost	all	of	the	shares	in	the	20-stock	Major	Market	Index	,	which	*T*-109	mimics	the	industrial	average	,	were	sharply	higher	.
Some	1,111	Big	Board	issues	advanced	in	price	and	only	448	declined	,	while	broader	market	averages	rose	sharply	.
Standard	&	Poor	's	500-Stock	Index	climbed	5.29	to	340.36	,	the	Dow	Jones	Equity	Market	Index	added	4.70	to	318.79	and	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	Composite	Index	climbed	2.65	to
Great	Northern	surged	20	1\/8	to	62	7\/8	,	well	above	Georgia-Pacific	's	offering	price	of	$	58	*U*	a	share	,	amid	speculation	that	other	suitors	for	the	company	would	surface	or	that	the	bid	would	be	raised	*-1	.
Nearly	6.3	million	shares	,	or	about	11.5	%	of	the	company	's	shares	outstanding	,	changed	hands	in	Big	Board	composite	trading	.
With	stocks	having	been	battered	*-1	lately	because	of	the	collapse	of	takeover	offers	for	UAL	,	the	parent	company	of	United	Airlines	,	and	AMR	,	the	parent	of	American	Airlines	,	analysts	viewed	the	proposal	as	a	psychological	lift	for	the	market	.
The	$	3.18	billion	*U*	bid	,	which	*T*-110	had	been	rumored	*-1	since	last	week	,	``	creates	a	better	feeling	that	there	's	value	in	the	market	at	current	levels	and	renews	prospects	for	a	hot	tape	,	''	says	0	*T*-2	A.C.	Moore	,	director	of	research	at	Argus	Research	Corp	.
Traders	and	analysts	alike	said	0	the	market	's	surge	also	reflected	an	easing	of	concerns	about	volatility	because	of	moves	*ICH*-1	by	a	number	of	brokerage	firms	*	to	curtail	or	cease	stock-index	arbitrage	.
Much	of	the	instability	in	stock	prices	lately	has	been	blamed	*-1	on	arbitrage	trading	,	designed	*	to	profit	from	differences	in	prices	between	stocks	and	index	futures	.
``	People	are	looking	for	an	ability	*	to	try	and	read	the	market	,	rather	than	be	manipulated	*-1	,	''	said	*T*-2	Dudley	A.	Eppel	,	manager	of	equity	trading	at	Donaldson	,	Lufkin	&	Jenrette	.
He	noted	that	institutional	investors	showed	``	pretty	general	''	interest	in	stocks	in	the	latest	session	.
But	traders	also	said	0	arbitrage-related	trading	contributed	to	the	market	's	surge	,	as	buy	programs	boosted	prices	shortly	after	the	opening	and	sporadically	through	the	remainder	of	the	session	.
Georgia-Pacific	fell	2	1\/2	to	50	7\/8	,	but	most	paper	and	forest-products	stocks	firmed	as	market	players	speculated	about	other	potential	industry	takeover	targets	.

BankAmerica	climbed	1	3\/4	to	30	after	PaineWebber	boosted	its	investment	opinion	on	the	stock	to	its	highest	rating	.
The	upgrade	reflected	the	20	%	decline	in	shares	of	the	bank	since	the	firm	lowered	its	rating	in	early	October	,	based	on	the	belief	0	the	stock	had	become	expensive	.

*-1	Under	attack	by	its	own	listed	companies	and	powerful	floor	traders	,	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	is	considering	*-1	reinstituting	a	``	collar	''	on	program	trading	that	it	abandoned	*T*-134	last	year	,	according	to	people	familiar	with	the	Big	Board	.
The	exchange	also	may	step	up	its	disclosure	of	firms	engaged	*	in	program	trading	,	these	people	said	0	*T*-1	.
Big	Board	officials	would	n't	comment	publicly	.
But	in	an	interview	in	which	he	called	the	stock	market	's	volatility	a	``	national	problem	*T*-3	,	''	Big	Board	Chairman	John	J.	Phelan	Jr.	said	,	``	We	are	going	*-1	to	try	*-2	to	do	some	things	0	*ICH*-4	in	the	short	intermediate	term	''	*T*-5	to	help	the	situation	.
Mr.	Phelan	has	been	viewed	*-1	by	many	exchange	members	as	*	being	indifferent	to	stock-price	swings	caused	*	by	program	trades	.
He	said	0	he	is	``	very	surprised	''	by	the	furor	over	program	trading	and	the	exchange	's	role	in	it	that	*T*-135	has	raged	in	recent	days	.
Mr.	Phelan	said	that	the	Big	Board	has	been	trying	*-1	to	deal	quietly	with	the	issue	,	but	that	*	banning	computer-assisted	trading	strategies	entirely	,	as	some	investors	want	,	would	be	like	``	*	taking	everybody	out	of	an	automobile	and	making	them	ride	a	horse	.	''
The	exchange	has	a	board	meeting	scheduled	*	for	tomorrow	,	and	it	is	expected	that	some	public	announcement	could	be	made	*-1	after	that	.
Big	Board	officials	have	been	under	seige	from	both	investors	and	the	exchange	's	own	floor	traders	since	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	's	190-point	tumble	on	Oct.	13	.
Mr.	Phelan	has	n't	been	making	public	remarks	in	recent	days	,	and	many	people	have	urged	him	*-1	to	take	more	of	a	leadership	role	on	the	program	trading	issue	.
What	the	Big	Board	is	considering	*T*-1	is	re-establishing	a	``	collar	''	on	program	trading	when	the	market	moves	significantly	*T*-2	.
Early	last	year	,	after	a	140-point	,	one-day	drop	in	the	Dow	,	the	Big	Board	instituted	the	collar	,	which	*T*-136	banned	program	trading	through	the	Big	Board	's	computers	whenever	the	Dow	moved	50	points	up	or	down	in	a	day	*T*-1	.
It	did	n't	work	.
``	The	collar	was	penetrated	*-1	on	a	number	of	occasions	,	''	*	meaning	0	securities	firms	figured	out	ways	0	*	to	conduct	program	trades	*	to	circumvent	the	collar	and	use	the	Big	Board	's	electronic	trading	system	*T*-2	,	Mr.	Phelan	said	0	*T*-3	.
That	was	when	the	exchange	took	a	new	tack	by	*-2	publishing	monthly	statistics	listing	the	top	15	program	trading	firms	*T*-1	.
Exchange	officials	emphasized	that	the	Big	Board	is	considering	a	variety	of	actions	0	*	to	deal	with	program	trading	*T*-1	.
People	familiar	with	the	exchange	said	0	another	idea	likely	*	to	be	approved	*-1	is	*	expanding	the	monthly	reports	on	program	trading	*-2	to	cover	specific	days	or	even	hours	of	heavy	program	trading	and	who	*T*-137	was	doing	it	.
Meanwhile	,	another	big	Wall	Street	brokerage	firm	joined	others	that	*T*-138	have	been	pulling	back	from	program	trading	.
American	Express	Co.	's	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	Inc.	unit	said	0	it	ceased	all	index-arbitrage	program	trading	for	client	accounts	.
In	stock-index	arbitrage	,	traders	buy	and	sell	large	amounts	of	stock	with	offsetting	trades	in	stock-index	futures	*-1	to	profit	from	fleeting	price	discrepancies	between	the	two	markets	.
Shearson	,	which	in	September	*T*-1	was	the	11th-biggest	program	trader	on	the	Big	Board	,	had	already	suspended	stock-index	arbitrage	for	its	own	account	.
Also	,	CS	First	Boston	Inc.	's	First	Boston	Corp.	unit	,	the	fifth-biggest	program	trader	in	September	,	is	``	preparing	a	response	''	to	the	program-trading	outcry	,	officials	of	the	firm	said	0	*T*-1	.
First	Boston	is	one	of	the	few	major	Wall	Street	firms	that	*T*-139	have	n't	pulled	back	from	program	trading	in	recent	days	.
Mr.	Phelan	is	an	adroit	diplomat	who	normally	*T*-1	appears	*-2	to	be	solidly	in	control	of	the	Big	Board	's	factions	.
But	he	has	been	getting	heat	from	all	sides	over	program	trading	.
Mr.	Phelan	's	recent	remarks	that	investors	simply	must	get	used	to	the	stock-market	volatility	from	program	trading	have	drawn	criticism	from	both	the	exchange	's	stock	specialists	,	who	*T*-140	make	markets	in	individual	stocks	,	and	from	many	companies	that	*T*-141	have	shares	listed	*	on	the	Big	Board	.
Mr.	Phelan	said	that	his	predicting	continued	volatility	is	just	``	how	the	world	is	*T*-1	.
If	*	bringing	the	message	is	a	crime	,	I	'm	guilty	of	it	.	''
But	he	said	0	this	does	n't	mean	0	he	is	satisfied	with	the	market	's	big	swings	.
``	We	're	trying	*-1	to	take	care	of	a	heck	of	a	lot	of	constituents	,	''	Mr.	Phelan	said	*T*-2	.
``	Each	one	has	a	different	agenda	.	''
For	example	,	in	a	special	meeting	Monday	with	Mr.	Phelan	,	senior	officials	of	some	of	the	Big	Board	's	49	stock	specialist	firms	complained	that	the	exchange	is	no	longer	representing	their	interests	.
``	We	are	looking	for	representation	0	we	have	n't	had	*T*-1	,	''	a	specialist	said	*T*-2	.
``	We	've	had	dictation	.	''
After	another	session	0	Mr.	Phelan	held	*T*-1	yesterday	with	major	brokerage	firms	such	as	Morgan	Stanley	&	Co.	,	Goldman	,	Sachs	&	Co.	,	PaineWebber	Group	Inc.	and	First	Boston	--	all	of	which	*T*-142	have	engaged	in	program	trading	--	an	executive	of	a	top	brokerage	firm	said	,	``	Clearly	,	the	firms	want	the	exchange	to	take	leadership	.	''
Many	specialist	firms	resent	the	Big	Board	's	new	``	basket	''	product	that	*T*-143	allows	institutions	to	buy	or	sell	all	stocks	in	the	Standard	&	Poor	's	500-stock	index	in	one	shot	.
Ultimately	,	the	specialists	view	this	as	yet	another	step	toward	electronic	trading	that	*T*-144	could	eventually	destroy	their	franchise	.
``	His	-LCB-	Phelan	's	-RCB-	own	interests	are	in	*	building	an	electronic	marketplace	,	''	said	*T*-1	a	market	maker	.
The	basket	product	,	while	it	has	got	off	to	a	slow	start	,	is	being	supported	*-1	by	some	big	brokerage	firms	--	another	member	of	Mr.	Phelan	's	splintered	constituency	.
Mr.	Phelan	has	had	difficulty	*	convincing	the	public	that	the	Big	Board	is	serious	about	*	curbing	volatility	,	especially	as	the	exchange	clearly	relishes	its	role	as	the	home	for	$	200	billion	*U*	in	stock-index	funds	,	which	*T*-145	buy	huge	baskets	of	stocks	*	to	mimic	popular	stock-market	indexes	like	the	Standard	&	Poor	's	500	,	and	which	sometimes	*T*-146	employ	program	trading	.
The	Big	Board	wants	*-1	to	keep	such	index	funds	from	*	fleeing	to	overseas	markets	,	but	only	as	long	as	it	``	handles	it	intelligently	,	''	Mr.	Phelan	said	*T*-2	.
Despite	what	some	investors	are	suggesting	*T*-2	,	the	Big	Board	is	n't	even	considering	a	total	ban	on	program	trading	or	stock	futures	,	exchange	officials	said	0	*T*-1	.
Most	revisions	0	it	will	propose	*T*-1	will	be	geared	*-2	toward	*	slowing	down	program	trading	during	stressful	periods	,	said	0	*T*-3	officials	working	with	the	exchange	.
Computers	have	made	trading	more	rapid	,	but	that	can	be	fixed	*-1	with	some	fine-tuning	.
``	I	think	0	if	you	-LCB-	can	-RCB-	speed	things	up	,	you	can	slow	them	down	,	''	Mr.	Phelan	said	*T*-1	.
``	That	's	different	than	*	wrecking	them	.	''
While	volatility	wo	n't	go	away	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	,	``	Volatility	is	greater	than	program	trading	.
What	I	'm	trying	*-1	to	say	to	people	is	,	0	it	*EXP*-2	's	proper	*	to	worry	about	program	trading	,	but	it	's	only	a	piece	of	the	business	.	''
For	example	,	Mr.	Phelan	said	that	big	institutions	have	so	much	control	over	public	investments	that	they	can	cause	big	swings	in	the	market	,	regardless	of	index	arbitrage	.
``	A	lot	of	people	would	like	*-2	to	go	back	to	1970	,	''	before	program	trading	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
``	I	would	like	*-1	to	go	back	to	1970	.
But	we	're	not	going	back	to	1970	.	''
Indeed	,	Mr.	Phelan	said	that	if	stock-market	volatility	persists	,	the	U.S.	may	lose	its	edge	as	*	being	the	best	place	0	*	to	raise	capital	*T*-1	.
``	Japan	's	markets	are	more	stable	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
``	If	that	continues	,	a	significant	number	of	-LCB-	U.S.	.	-RCB-	companies	will	go	over	there	*-1	to	raise	money	.	''
In	coming	days	,	when	the	Big	Board	formulates	its	responses	to	the	program-trading	problem	*T*-1	,	Mr.	Phelan	may	take	a	more	public	role	in	the	issue	.
Lewis	L.	Glucksman	,	vice	chairman	of	Smith	Barney	,	Harris	Upham	&	Co.	,	said	:	``	This	is	a	problem	that	*T*-147	's	taking	on	a	life	of	its	own	.
The	program	trading	situation	seems	*-1	to	have	driven	individual	investors	as	well	as	others	out	of	the	market	,	and	even	Europeans	are	suspicious	.
The	exchange	should	take	a	pro-active	position	.	''
For	now	,	however	,	Mr.	Phelan	said	:	``	I	refuse	*-1	to	get	out	there	and	tell	everybody	0	everything	is	hunky-dory	.
We	have	a	major	problem	,	and	that	problem	is	volatility	.	''

A	reading	below	50	%	indicates	that	the	manufacturing	industry	is	slowing	while	a	reading	above	50	%	suggests	that	the	industry	is	expanding	.
Bond	prices	fell	after	the	Chicago	report	was	released	*-1	.
By	the	end	of	the	day	,	bond	prices	were	mixed	.
The	benchmark	30-year	bond	was	nearly	1\/4	point	higher	,	or	up	about	$	2.50	*U*	for	each	$	1,000	*U*	face	amount	.
New	two-year	notes	ended	unchanged	while	three-year	and	four-year	notes	were	slightly	lower	.
Municipal	bonds	ended	unchanged	to	as	much	as	1\/2	point	higher	while	mortgage-backed	securities	were	up	about	1\/8	point	.
Corporate	bonds	were	unchanged	.
In	the	corporate	market	,	an	expected	debt	offering	today	by	International	Business	Machines	Corp.	generated	considerable	attention	.
The	giant	computer	maker	is	slated	*-1	to	offer	$	500	million	*U*	of	30-year	non-callable	debentures	through	underwriters	led	*	by	Salomon	Brothers	Inc	.
Traders	expect	the	bonds	to	yield	about	0.60	to	0.65	percentage	point	above	the	Treasury	's	benchmark	30-year	bond	,	which	*T*-152	ended	Tuesday	with	a	yield	of	about	7.90	%	.
The	last	time	0	IBM	tapped	the	corporate	debt	market	*T*-2	was	in	April	1988	,	when	it	offered	$	500	million	*U*	of	debt	securities	*T*-1	.
IBM	's	visits	to	the	debt	market	are	closely	watched	*-1	by	treasurers	at	other	corporations	and	by	credit	market	analysts	.
Some	analysts	believe	0	the	company	has	the	ability	*	to	pinpoint	the	trough	in	interest-rate	cycles	.
In	October	1979	,	just	days	before	the	Federal	Reserve	raised	interest	rates	,	IBM	offered	$	1	billion	*U*	in	debt	securities	.
The	boost	in	rates	sent	IBM	's	bonds	*-2	tumbling	,	*-1	leaving	underwriters	with	millions	of	dollars	of	losses	and	triggering	a	sell-off	in	the	overall	market	.
The	company	``	ca	n't	be	bullish	if	they	're	doing	a	sizable	30-year	bullet	,	''	said	0	*T*-1	one	analyst	.
Others	said	0	IBM	might	increase	the	size	of	the	offering	to	as	much	as	$	1	billion	*U*	if	investor	demand	is	strong	.
The	company	has	$	1	billion	*U*	in	debt	filed	*	with	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	.
``	I	think	0	the	$	500	million	*U*	is	a	little	bit	of	a	fire	drill	,	''	said	*T*-1	Jim	Ednee	,	head	of	the	industrial	bond	department	at	Drexel	Burnham	Lambert	Inc	.
``	I	think	0	as	the	pricing	time	arrives	,	the	bonds	will	come	*	a	little	richer	and	in	a	larger	amount	.	''
Treasury	Securities
Treasury	prices	ended	mixed	in	light	trading	.
The	benchmark	30-year	bond	was	quoted	*-1	late	at	102	12\/32	*-2	to	yield	7.90	%	compared	with	102	7\/32	0	*T*-3	to	yield	7.92	%	Monday	.
The	latest	10-year	notes	were	unchanged	at	100	16\/32	0	*T*-1	to	yield	7.904	%	.
Short-term	rates	also	were	mixed	.
The	discount	rate	on	three-month	Treasury	bills	rose	slightly	from	the	average	rate	at	Monday	's	auction	to	7.79	%	for	a	bond-equivalent	yield	of	8.04	%	.
The	discount	rate	on	six-month	Treasury	bills	fell	slightly	to	7.60	%	for	a	bond-equivalent	yield	of	7.99	%	.
Corporate	Issues
Two	junk	bond	issues	were	priced	*-1	yesterday	,	including	a	scaled-backed	offering	by	Beatrice	Co	.
A	spokesman	for	underwriters	Salomon	Brothers	Inc.	said	0	Beatrice	cut	its	high-yield	offering	to	$	251	million	*U*	from	a	planned	$	350	million	*U*	after	it	*EXP*-2	became	clear	0	the	company	would	have	*-1	to	give	investors	higher	yields	.
In	the	two-part	offering	,	$	151	million	*U*	of	senior	subordinated	reset	notes	were	priced	*-1	at	99.75	and	carried	a	rate	of	13	3\/4	%	,	while	the	$	100	million	*U*	of	senior	subordinated	floating	rate	notes	were	priced	*-2	to	float	at	4.25	percentage	points	above	the	London	Interbank	Offered	Rate	,	or	LIBOR	.
The	one-year	LIBOR	rate	yesterday	was	8	7\/16	%	.
Since	the	recent	deterioration	of	the	junk-bond	market	,	at	least	two	other	junk	issuers	have	said	0	they	plan	*-1	to	scale	back	planned	high-yield	offerings	,	and	several	issues	have	been	postponed	*-2	.
William	Carmichael	,	Beatrice	chief	financial	officer	,	said	0	favorable	market	conditions	in	September	prompted	the	company	to	plan	more	debt	than	necessary	.
``	However	,	given	the	changes	in	the	market	conditions	that	*T*-153	have	occurred	since	then	,	we	decided	*-1	to	sell	only	the	amount	needed	*	to	proceed	with	our	contemplated	recapitalization	,	''	he	said	*T*-2	.
Under	the	firm	's	original	bank	credit	agreement	,	it	was	required	*-1	to	raise	$	250	million	*U*	of	subordinated	debt	0	*T*-2	to	be	used	*-3	*-4	to	repay	some	of	the	bank	borrowings	drawn	*	to	redeem	$	526.3	million	*U*	of	increasing	rate	debentures	in	August	.
A	month	ago	,	when	Beatrice	first	filed	*-1	to	sell	debt	*T*-3	,	the	company	had	planned	*-2	to	offer	$	200	million	*U*	of	its	senior	subordinated	reset	notes	at	a	yield	of	12	3\/4	%	.
The	$	150	million	*U*	in	senior	subordinated	floating-rate	notes	were	targeted	*-1	to	be	offered	*-2	at	a	price	*-2	to	float	four	percentage	points	above	the	three-month	LIBOR	.
By	October	,	however	,	market	conditions	had	deteriorated	and	the	reset	notes	were	targeted	*-1	to	be	offered	*-2	at	a	yield	of	between	13	1\/4	%	and	13	1\/2	%	.
Mr.	Carmichael	said	0	investors	also	demanded	stricter	convenants	.
Continental	Cablevision	Inc.	,	via	underwriters	at	Morgan	Stanley	&	Co.	,	priced	$	350	million	*U*	of	junk	bonds	at	par	*	to	yield	12	7\/8	%	.
Mortgage-Backed	Securities
J.C.	Penney	&	Co.	issued	$	350	million	*U*	of	securities	backed	*	by	credit-card	receivables	.
The	securities	were	priced	*-1	at	99.1875	*	to	yield	about	9.19	%	.
Underwriters	at	First	Boston	Corp.	said	0	the	J.C.	Penney	credit-card	securities	are	the	first	with	a	10-year	average	life	,	which	*T*-154	is	much	longer	than	previous	such	issues	.
Elsewhere	,	Ginnie	Mae	's	9	%	issue	for	November	delivery	was	quoted	*-1	at	98	18\/32	bid	*	,	up	5\/32	from	late	Monday	,	*	to	yield	about	9.333	%	to	a	12-year	average	life	assumption	.
Freddie	Mac	's	9	1\/2	%	issue	was	quoted	*-1	at	99	20\/32	,	up	3\/32	from	Monday	.
Fannie	Mae	's	9	%	issue	was	at	98	7\/32	,	up	1\/8	.
On	the	pricing	front	,	an	11-class	issue	of	$	500	million	*U*	Federal	Home	Loan	Mortgage	Corp	.
Remic	mortgage	securities	was	launched	*-1	by	a	Morgan	Stanley	group	.
The	offering	is	backed	*-1	by	Freddie	Mac	's	10	%	issue	with	a	weighted	average	term	to	maturity	of	29.583	months	.
Municipal	Issues
Municipal	bonds	were	little	changed	to	1\/2	point	higher	in	late	dealings	.
``	We	were	oversold	*-1	and	today	we	bounced	back	.
Some	accounts	came	in	for	some	blocks	in	the	secondary	-LCB-	market	-RCB-	,	which	we	have	n't	seen	*T*-1	for	a	while	,	''	said	*T*-2	one	trader	.
``	There	were	no	-LCB-	sell	-RCB-	lists	and	the	calendar	is	lightening	up	a	bit	.
There	's	light	at	the	end	of	the	tunnel	for	municipals	,	''	he	said	*T*-2	,	*-1	adding	that	he	expects	prices	to	``	inch	up	''	in	the	near	term	.
The	market	's	tone	improved	after	Monday	's	pricing	of	$	813	million	*U*	New	York	City	general	obligation	bonds	.
The	issue	's	smooth	absorption	eased	fears	that	supply	would	overwhelm	demand	in	coming	sessions	,	traders	said	0	*T*-1	.
Demand	for	the	bonds	was	strong	enough	*	to	permit	underwriters	to	trim	some	yields	in	the	tax-exempt	portion	of	the	offering	late	Monday	.
A	two-part	$	75.1	million	*U*	offering	of	wastewater	treatment	bonds	by	the	New	Jersey	Wastewater	Treatment	Trust	was	more	than	half	sold	*-1	by	late	in	the	session	,	according	to	lead	underwriter	Merrill	Lynch	Capital	Markets	.
The	debt	was	reoffered	*-1	*-1	priced	*-2	to	yield	from	6	%	in	1991	to	7.15	%	in	2008-2009	.
Foreign	Bonds
Most	foreign	government	bonds	markets	were	quiet	.
West	German	bonds	firmed	a	bit	after	Monday	's	fall	,	but	traders	said	0	the	market	remains	bearish	due	to	speculation	that	interest	rates	could	rise	again	.
In	a	speech	given	*	Friday	but	released	*	late	Monday	,	Bundesbank	Vice	President	Helmut	Schlesinger	suggested	that	it	*EXP*-1	was	risky	*	to	claim	that	the	booming	German	economy	has	reached	the	peak	of	its	cycle	.
His	comments	were	interpreted	*-1	as	a	sign	that	higher	interest	rates	are	possible	.
On	Oct.	5	,	the	Bundesbank	raised	the	Lombard	and	discount	rates	by	one	percentage	point	to	8	%	and	6	%	*U*	,	respectively	,	the	highest	levels	in	seven	years	.
Germany	's	7	%	bond	due	October	1999	was	unchanged	at	99.35	*-1	to	yield	7.09	%	while	the	6	3\/4	%	notes	due	July	1994	rose	0.025	point	to	97.275	*-2	to	yield	7.445	%	.
Japanese	government	bonds	showed	little	change	.
Japan	's	benchmark	No.	111	issue	due	1998	ended	on	brokers	'	screens	at	95.90	,	down	0.02	point	,	*-1	to	yield	5.435	%	.
British	government	bonds	were	little	changed	as	investors	awaited	an	address	on	economic	policy	by	John	Major	,	the	new	Chancellor	of	the	Exchequer	.
Britain	's	benchmark	11	3\/4	%	bond	due	2003\/2007	rose	2\/32	to	111	1\/2	*-1	to	yield	10.14	%	while	the	11	3\/4	%	notes	due	1991	were	unchanged	at	98	21\/32	*-2	to	yield	12.95	%	.
Paramount	Communications	Inc.	said	0	it	sold	two	Simon	&	Schuster	information	services	units	to	Macmillan	Inc.	,	a	subsidiary	of	Maxwell	Communication	Corp	.
The	two	units	are	Prentice	Hall	Information	Services	,	which	*T*-155	publishes	tax	,	financial	planning	and	business	law	information	,	among	other	services	,	and	Prentice	Hall	Information	Network	,	which	*T*-156	electronically	delivers	tax	information	.
Terms	were	n't	disclosed	*-1	,	but	industry	executives	said	0	the	units	were	sold	*-2	for	$	40	million	*U*	.
Arthur	H.	Rosenfeld	,	previously	president	of	the	Prentice	Hall	Tax	and	Professional	Services	division	,	was	named	*-1	president	of	the	newly	formed	Macmillan	Professional	and	Business	Reference	division	.
Simon	&	Schuster	retains	the	Corporation	Law	looseleaf	service	,	which	*T*-157	will	become	part	of	its	Prentice	Hall	Law	&	Business	unit	.
A	governing	body	of	both	the	Financial	Accounting	Standards	Board	and	the	Governmental	Accounting	Standards	Board	voted	*-1	to	give	the	FASB	jurisdiction	over	accounting	standards	for	certain	government-owned	entities	.
The	Financial	Accounting	Foundation	voted	12-2	that	FASB	accounting	rules	supercede	GASB	rules	in	regard	to	utilities	,	hospitals	,	and	colleges	and	universities	owned	*	by	the	government	.
GASB	rules	still	apply	for	other	government	units	.
After	the	GASB	was	founded	*-1	in	1984	,	11	years	after	the	FASB	,	the	government-owned	entities	were	supposed	*-2	to	follow	FASB	rules	unless	the	GASB	superceded	them	.
The	GASB	had	told	governments	0	they	did	n't	have	*-1	to	follow	FASB	rules	on	depreciation	,	*	making	it	*EXP*-2	difficult	for	bond-rating	agencies	to	compare	private	and	state-owned	schools	,	which	*T*-158	compete	in	the	public	bond	market	.
The	foundation	vote	is	effective	for	the	affected	government	entities	with	fiscal	years	that	*T*-159	begin	*	starting	next	Jan.	1	and	makes	the	financial	results	of	the	hospitals	,	colleges	and	schools	easier	*	to	compare	with	for-profit	businesses	.
But	it	may	lead	to	separate	financial	reports	based	*	on	different	rules	for	the	government	entities	under	FASB	rules	and	those	still	under	GASB	rules	.
``	Managers	of	government	entities	are	often	more	concerned	with	the	political	and	legal	structure	and	financial-report	comparability	with	profit-making	businesses	is	n't	always	as	high	a	priority	,	''	a	foundation	spokesman	said	*T*-1	.
Avery	Inc.	said	0	it	completed	the	sale	of	Uniroyal	Chemical	Holding	Co.	to	a	group	led	*	by	management	of	Uniroyal	Chemical	Co.	,	the	unit	's	main	business	.
It	valued	the	transaction	at	$	800	million	*U*	.
Avery	,	which	*T*-160	continues	*-1	to	operate	a	coal	company	0	it	expects	*-3	to	sell	*T*-2	at	a	loss	,	said	in	proxy	materials	0	it	intends	*-4	to	seek	control	of	one	or	more	companies	.
After	fees	and	repayment	of	debt	,	Avery	is	left	*-1	with	about	$	24	million	*U*	in	cash	and	securities	from	the	Uniroyal	sale	.
Avery	paid	$	750	million	*U*	,	including	various	legal	and	financing	fees	,	*-1	to	acquire	Uniroyal	Chemical	,	Middlebury	,	Conn.	,	in	1986	--	a	move	that	*T*-161	burdened	Avery	with	debt	.
In	over-the-counter	trading	,	Avery	shares	were	quoted	*-1	yesterday	at	a	bid	price	of	93.75	cents	a	share	.
According	to	Avery	,	for	the	year	ended	Sept.	30	,	1988	,	Uniroyal	Chemical	had	sales	of	$	734.2	million	*U*	and	a	net	loss	of	$	47.1	million	*U*	.
An	Avery	spokesman	said	that	the	loss	was	magnified	*-1	by	accounting	adjustments	and	that	the	company	's	loss	was	smaller	on	a	cash	basis	.
Uniroyal	has	2,600	employees	and	facilities	in	the	U.S.	,	Canada	,	Brazil	,	Italy	and	Taiwan	.
In	a	related	development	,	Avery	said	0	it	completed	a	recapitalization	in	which	its	controlling	shareholders	and	top	officers	,	Nelson	Peltz	and	Peter	W.	May	,	surrendered	warrants	and	preferred	stock	in	exchange	for	a	larger	stake	in	Avery	's	common	shares	*T*-1	.
On	a	fully	diluted	basis	,	the	two	raised	their	stake	to	68	%	from	51	%	.
In	December	1988	,	Messrs.	Peltz	and	May	sold	their	stock	in	Triangle	Industries	Inc.	,	a	packaging	company	0	they	controlled	*T*-1	,	to	Pechiney	Corp.	of	France	.
The	executives	had	profited	handsomely	by	*	building	American	National	Can	Co.	,	Triangle	's	chief	asset	.
In	January	1989	,	the	two	men	acquired	the	non-packaging	assets	of	Triangle	,	including	a	controlling	stake	in	Avery	and	,	by	extension	,	Uniroyal	Chemical	.
In	the	August	proxy	material	,	Avery	said	that	unless	it	sold	Uniroyal	,	its	ability	*	to	service	debt	would	be	hurt	*-1	and	Avery	's	shareholder	value	would	``	continue	*-2	to	erode	.	''
Until	Avery	makes	an	acquisition	,	Messrs.	Peltz	and	May	will	waive	their	direct	salaries	and	bonuses	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-1	.
For	at	least	the	next	six	months	,	however	,	Avery	will	continue	*-1	to	pay	$	200,000	*U*	a	month	for	management	services	to	a	company	controlled	*	by	Messrs.	Peltz	and	May	,	according	to	the	proxy	material	.
Clarcor	Inc.	said	0	a	plan	*	to	sell	its	J.L.	Clark	Inc.	subsidiary	to	a	group	headed	*	by	Anderson	Industries	Inc.	for	$	70.3	million	*U*	has	been	terminated	*-1	.
Clarcor	,	a	maker	of	packaging	and	filtration	products	,	said	0	the	two	companies	could	n't	agree	on	terms	of	a	definitive	agreement	.
The	sale	price	of	the	unit	,	which	*T*-162	makes	packaging	products	,	was	*-1	to	consist	of	cash	,	notes	and	an	amount	0	*T*-2	to	be	determined	*-3	by	the	unit	's	future	performance	.
Clarcor	said	0	it	is	inviting	proposals	from	other	prospective	purchasers	of	the	unit	.
Both	Clarcor	and	Anderson	are	based	in	Rockford	,	Ill	.
Rally	's	Inc.	said	0	it	adopted	a	shareholders	rights	plan	*	to	protect	shareholders	from	an	inadequately	priced	takeover	offer	.
The	plan	provides	for	the	distribution	of	one	common	stock-purchase	right	as	a	dividend	for	each	share	of	common	outstanding	.
Each	right	entitles	shareholders	to	buy	one-half	share	of	common	for	$	30	*U*	.
Earlier	this	month	,	a	group	led	*	by	three	of	the	company	's	directors	,	Burt	Sugarman	,	James	M.	Trotter	III	and	Willam	E.	Trotter	II	,	indicated	0	it	had	a	45.2	%	stake	in	the	Louisville	,	Ky.	,	fast-food	company	and	that	it	planned	*-1	to	seek	a	majority	of	seats	on	Rally	's	nine-member	board	.
The	company	said	0	it	was	``	concerned	about	the	announced	intent	*	to	acquire	control	of	the	company	''	by	a	Sugarman-led	group	.
Fujitsu	Ltd.	said	0	it	wants	*-1	to	withdraw	its	controversial	one-yen	bid	*	to	design	a	waterworks	computer	system	for	the	city	of	Hiroshima	.
Meanwhile	,	Japan	's	Fair	Trade	Commission	said	0	it	was	considering	*-1	launching	an	investigation	into	whether	the	bid	,	the	equivalent	of	less	than	a	penny	,	violates	anti-monopoly	laws	.
Hiroshima	last	week	held	an	auction	*-1	to	pick	the	contractor	,	*-1	expecting	*-2	to	pay	about	11	million	yen	for	the	project	.
Eight	companies	submitted	bids	,	but	Fujitsu	won	the	contract	by	*-1	essentially	saying	0	it	would	do	the	job	for	free	.
News	of	the	bid	drew	sharp	criticism	from	other	computer	companies	and	industry	observers	.
Fujitsu	itself	,	which	*T*-163	said	0	the	bid	had	n't	been	approved	*-1	by	its	headquarters	,	was	clearly	embarrassed	.
The	bid	was	n't	``	socially	acceptable	,	''	a	company	spokeswoman	said	0	*T*-1	.
Hiroshima	officials	said	0	they	still	consider	the	contract	in	effect	and	had	no	immediate	plans	*	to	cancel	it	.
They	said	0	they	wanted	*-1	to	wait	for	the	outcome	of	any	government	investigation	before	*-2	deciding	what	*-3	to	do	*T*-164	.
The	city	's	Department	of	Consumer	Affairs	charged	Newmark	&	Lewis	Inc.	with	*	failing	*-1	to	deliver	on	its	promise	of	*	lowering	prices	.
In	a	civil	suit	commenced	in	state	Supreme	Court	in	New	York	,	the	agency	alleged	that	the	consumer-electronics	and	appliance	discount-retailing	chain	engaged	in	deceptive	advertising	by	*-2	claiming	*-1	to	have	``	lowered	every	price	on	every	item	''	as	part	of	an	advertising	campaign	that	*T*-165	began	June	1	.
The	agency	said	0	it	monitored	Newmark	&	Lewis	's	advertised	prices	before	and	after	the	ad	campaign	,	and	found	that	the	prices	of	at	least	50	different	items	either	increased	or	stayed	the	same	.
In	late	May	,	Newmark	&	Lewis	announced	a	plan	*	to	cut	prices	5	%	to	20	%	and	eliminate	what	it	called	*T*-166	a	``	standard	discount-retailing	practice	''	of	*	negotiating	individual	deals	with	customers	.
The	consumer	agency	also	disputed	Newmark	&	Lewis	's	continuing	strategy	of	*	advertising	``	new	lower	prices	''	when	allgedly	there	have	n't	been	price	reductions	since	June	1	.
Richard	D.	Lewis	,	president	of	the	47-store	chain	,	defended	the	company	's	pricing	campaign	,	*-1	saying	0	it	did	n't	use	``	the	misleading	expression	`	reduced	from	original	prices	.	'	''
Mr.	Lewis	said	0	the	company	marked	price	tags	and	advertised	at	its	``	lowest	possible	prices	''	for	all	its	merchandise	*-1	to	reduce	public	confusion	.
Mr.	Lewis	said	0	the	company	gave	the	Consumer	Affairs	department	``	volumes	of	documents	''	*-1	to	substantiate	its	statements	,	and	made	``	every	effort	*	to	comply	''	with	all	the	agency	's	policies	.
In	its	suit	,	the	consumer	agency	seeks	fines	of	$	1,000	*U*	per	violation	of	the	city	's	Consumer	Protection	Law	,	costs	of	investigation	,	and	an	injunction	0	*T*-1	to	prevent	Newmark	&	Lewis	from	*-2	continuing	its	allegedly	deceptive	advertising	.
Wary	investors	have	been	running	for	the	stock	market	's	equivalent	of	bomb	shelters	,	*-1	buying	shares	of	gold-mining	and	utility	companies	.
Those	two	groups	have	recently	been	leading	the	list	of	stocks	setting	new	highs	.
On	Friday	,	when	only	a	dozen	common	stocks	hit	52-week	highs	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	*T*-1	,	five	were	gold-mining	issues	,	and	another	four	were	utilities	.
On	Monday	,	when	a	mere	seven	common	stocks	managed	new	highs	*T*-1	,	six	were	utilities	or	golds	.
At	first	glance	,	gold	and	utilities	seem	strange	bedfellows	.
After	all	,	gold	prices	usually	soar	when	inflation	is	high	*T*-1	.
Utility	stocks	,	on	the	other	hand	,	thrive	on	disinflation	,	because	the	fat	dividends	0	utilities	pay	*T*-1	look	more	attractive	when	prices	are	falling	-LRB-	or	rising	slowly	-RRB-	*T*-2	.
But	the	two	groups	have	something	very	important	in	common	:	They	are	both	havens	for	scared	money	,	stocks	for	people	who	*T*-167	hate	stocks	.
It	's	as	if	investors	,	the	past	few	days	,	are	betting	that	something	is	going	*-1	to	go	wrong	--	even	if	they	do	n't	know	what	.
If	the	stock	market	and	the	economy	catch	their	breath	and	show	that	they	're	on	firmer	footing	,	these	stocks	might	well	fall	back	.
Indeed	,	that	happened	to	some	extent	yesterday	,	as	industrial	stocks	rebounded	,	partly	on	news	of	takeovers	in	the	paper	industry	.
Still	,	a	lot	of	investors	clearly	have	revived	their	interest	in	gold	and	utility	shares	.
``	The	primary	overriding	thing	is	that	people	are	frightened	,	''	says	*T*-1	Martin	Sass	,	a	New	York	money	manager	.
``	The	aftershocks	of	Oct.	13	-LRB-	when	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	dropped	190	points	*T*-1	-RRB-	are	still	reverberating	.	''
Certainly	,	the	Oct.	13	sell-off	did	n't	settle	any	stomachs	.
Beyond	that	,	money	managers	and	analysts	see	other	problems	.
Inventories	are	creeping	up	;	car	inventories	are	already	high	,	and	big	auto	makers	are	idling	plants	.
Takeover	fever	has	cooled	,	*	removing	a	major	horse	from	the	market	's	cart	.
Britain	's	unsettled	political	scene	also	worries	some	investors	.
``	The	gyrations	in	the	British	government	''	add	political	uncertainty	on	top	of	high	inflation	and	a	ragged	stock	market	,	says	0	*T*-1	John	Hoffman	,	assistant	director	of	research	at	Smith	Barney	,	Harris	Upham	&	Co	.
``	One	of	the	three	major	markets	in	the	world	is	getting	chewed	*-1	up	pretty	bad	.	''
``	If	the	Fed	does	not	come	to	the	rescue	and	produce	lower	short-term	interest	rates	over	the	next	30	days	,	the	market	's	going	*-1	to	flounder	,	''	says	Larry	Wachtel	,	a	market	analyst	with	Prudential-Bache	Securities	.
With	this	sort	of	sentiment	common	,	it	*EXP*-1	's	natural	for	investors	to	seek	out	``	defensive	''	investments	.
Utilities	are	a	classic	example	:	Even	in	recessions	,	people	continue	*-1	to	use	electric	power	,	water	and	gas	at	a	fairly	steady	rate	.
Such	defensive	issues	as	food	,	tobacco	,	and	drug	stocks	have	been	in	favor	for	some	time	.
But	many	of	these	stocks	have	now	become	expensive	.
Mr.	Wachtel	points	to	Coca-Cola	Co.	and	PepsiCo	Inc.	as	examples	:	They	're	selling	for	18	to	22	times	estimated	1990	per-share	earnings	.
Gold	stocks	are	n't	cheap	on	this	basis	,	either	,	with	many	selling	for	20	times	earnings	or	more	.
Even	utility	stocks	are	n't	all	that	inexpensive	,	*-1	at	an	average	of	14	times	earnings	.
But	the	two	groups	represent	a	further	step	in	defensiveness	.
If	gold	stocks	and	utilities	continue	*-1	to	lead	,	it	may	signal	that	the	market	is	in	for	rough	times	.
That	's	just	what	Joseph	Granville	expects	*T*-168	.
``	We	are	going	*-1	to	explode	lower	,	''	says	*T*-2	the	flamboyant	market	seer	,	who	*T*-169	had	a	huge	following	a	few	years	back	.
``	Anyone	telling	you	*-1	to	buy	stocks	in	this	market	is	technically	irresponsible	.
You	do	n't	want	*-1	to	own	anything	*ICH*-2	long	except	gold	stocks	.	''
One	reason	for	his	gloom	is	a	weekly	tally	0	he	keeps	*T*-1	of	stocks	within	a	point	of	*	hitting	new	highs	or	lows	.
Last	Friday	,	96	stocks	on	the	Big	Board	hit	new	12-month	lows	.
But	by	Mr.	Granville	's	count	,	493	issues	were	within	one	point	of	such	lows	.
Robert	Stovall	,	a	veteran	New	York	money	manager	and	president	of	Stovall\/Twenty-First	Securities	,	has	money	in	both	gold	and	utility	issues	.
``	I	think	0	we	could	very	well	have	-LCB-	an	economic	-RCB-	slowdown	,	beginning	very	soon	if	not	already	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Stovall	does	n't	expect	an	actual	recession	.
But	he	does	expect	``	a	muffler	dragger	''	of	an	economy	,	with	``	very	slow	growth	,	maybe	one	quarter	of	no	growth	at	all	.	''
In	such	a	climate	,	utility	stocks	look	good	to	him	.
He	favors	FPL	Group	Inc.	,	Florida	Progress	Corp.	,	TECO	Energy	Inc.	,	Wisconsin	Energy	Corp.	,	and	Dominion	Resources	Inc	.
The	appeal	of	gold	issues	,	Mr.	Stovall	says	0	*T*-1	,	is	that	``	they	're	a	counter	group	.
You	go	into	them	because	they	move	counter	to	the	general	market	.	''
He	adds	that	gold	stocks	had	been	down	so	long	0	they	were	``	ready	for	a	bounce	.	''
His	favorites	are	American	Barrick	Resources	Corp.	,	Echo	Bay	Mines	Ltd.	and	Coeur	d'Alene	Mines	Corp	.
Nevertheless	,	Mr.	Stovall	emphasizes	that	``	you	do	n't	buy	-LCB-	gold	stocks	-RCB-	based	on	powerful	fundamentals	.	''
In	addition	to	*-1	having	high	price-earnings	ratios	,	most	pay	puny	dividends	,	if	any	.
``	The	earning	power	-LCB-	of	gold	mining	companies	-RCB-	is	restricted	unless	the	gold	price	hops	up	over	$	425	*U*	an	ounce	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
Abby	Cohen	,	an	investment	strategist	for	Drexel	Burnham	Lambert	,	also	thinks	0	it	*EXP*-1	makes	sense	*	to	have	some	money	in	both	utilities	and	gold	.
``	My	outlook	is	for	a	decline	of	about	10	%	in	corporate	profits	''	in	1990	,	she	says	*T*-1	.
But	``	a	bunch	of	utilities	''	should	post	profit	increases	.
Among	utilities	,	Drexel	currently	favors	Entergy	Corp.	and	General	Public	Utilities	Corp	.
As	for	gold	,	she	notes	that	it	usually	rises	when	the	dollar	is	weak	*T*-1	,	as	it	has	been	*?*	lately	.
Among	gold	stocks	,	Drexel	likes	Battle	Mountain	Gold	Co.	,	Newmont	Gold	Co.	and	Freeport-McMoRan	Gold	Co	.
It	*EXP*-2	never	ceases	*-1	to	amaze	me	how	the	business	world	continues	*-3	to	trivialize	the	world	's	environmental	problems	-LRB-	``	Is	Science	,	or	Private	Gain	,	Driving	Ozone	Policy	?	''	by	George	Melloan	,	Business	World	,	Oct.	24	-RRB-	.
*	To	suggest	that	a	10	%	drop	in	ozone	by	the	middle	of	the	next	century	would	be	negligible	is	irresponsible	and	shortsighted	.
*	Consider	the	fact	that	a	mere	2	%	drop	in	ozone	would	increase	birth	defects	and	mutations	by	*-1	allowing	solar	radiation	to	alter	the	DNA	structure	.
Even	a	small	reduction	is	unacceptable	and	*	to	suggest	otherwise	is	penny-wise	and	pound-foolish	.
The	reason	0	environmentalists	``	do	n't	mind	*-1	seeing	new	crises	arise	*T*-2	''	is	because	there	are	new	crises	.
Crises	larger	and	more	dangerous	to	the	quality	of	life	than	they	were	*?*	10	years	ago	.
If	you	are	doubtful	,	*	consider	for	a	moment	that	the	Pomton	Lakes	Reservoirs	in	northern	New	Jersey	,	which	*T*-170	supply	the	tristate	area	with	drinking	water	,	are	riddled	*-1	with	toxic	PCBs	.
This	is	a	fact	and	not	the	product	of	some	environmental	doomsayer	or	a	group	's	ploy	*	to	create	a	market	.
It	's	time	0	business	leaders	and	the	general	public	learn	that	mankind	does	not	rule	over	this	natural	environment	but	is	rather	the	integral	,	symbiotic	player	within	nature	's	workings	*T*-1	.
Mark	T.	Kuiper	Jersey	City	,	N.J	.
Mr.	Melloan	's	column	was	right	on	the	money	,	but	I	wish	0	it	could	have	gone	one	step	further	.
As	an	employee	of	a	major	refrigerator	and	freezer	manufacturer	,	I	have	been	heavily	involved	in	*	dealing	with	the	political	manifestations	of	the	Rowland-Molina	theory	-LRB-	named	*	after	the	researchers	who	*T*-171	found	in	1974	that	chlorofluorocarbons	contributed	to	the	depletion	of	ozone	in	the	earth	's	atmosphere	-RRB-	and	the	Montreal	Protocol	.
An	important	part	of	my	effort	has	been	*	to	understand	the	science	so	I	can	explain	it	to	corporate	colleagues	facing	major	changes	in	product	design	.
In	my	research	,	I	have	found	a	paper	by	Joseph	Scotto	of	the	National	Cancer	Institute	and	several	colleagues	reporting	an	11-year	decrease	in	UV-B	radiation	at	eight	U.S.	measurement	sites	.
Our	concern	for	the	ozone	layer	,	of	course	,	grows	out	of	the	potential	for	increasing	UV-B	radiation	,	which	*T*-172	could	damage	flora	and	fauna	.
The	last	of	the	measurements	reported	*	was	in	1985	,	but	recent	conversations	with	Mr.	Scotto	indicated	that	he	knew	of	no	recent	changes	in	the	trend	.
I	understand	,	but	have	n't	yet	verified	*ICH*-1	,	that	there	are	studies	by	Norwegians	,	Russians	and	the	Max	Planck	Institute	that	*T*-173	show	either	unchanging	or	declining	UV-B	at	the	surface	.
To	me	,	this	calls	into	question	the	validity	of	the	Rowland-Molina	theory	and	hence	the	whole	chlorofluorocarbons	replacement	effort	.
This	,	in	turn	,	threatens	the	massive	vested	interests	of	which	you	have	written	*T*-1	.
My	questions	on	this	subject	at	a	recent	meeting	at	the	World	Resources	Institute	with	representatives	of	the	National	Resource	Development	Commission	,	the	Environmental	Protection	Agency	,	Friends	of	the	Earth	,	etc.	were	greeted	*-1	with	derision	and	some	mumbled	comments	about	that	report	being	discredited	*	.
When	I	expressed	amazement	that	no	one	was	undertaking	a	more	current	and	credible	UV-B	study	*T*-1	,	I	was	urged	*-2	to	get	back	to	the	agenda	topic	,	which	*T*-174	was	,	ironically	,	a	schedule	for	*	getting	rid	of	HCFCs	,	the	so-called	soft	CFCs	that	*T*-175	are	such	an	important	part	of	the	CFC	substitution	scenario	.
Subsequently	,	I	have	learned	that	a	private	group	,	of	which	Du	Pont	is	a	part	*T*-1	,	is	funding	a	modest	program	*	to	continue	data	gathering	at	the	Scotto	report	stations	as	well	as	to	develop	more	sophisticated	UVB	measuring	instruments	.
But	this	is	almost	an	underground	activity	.
To	my	knowledge	,	no	government	entities	,	including	the	EPA	,	are	pursuing	UV-B	measurements	.
The	topic	never	comes	up	in	ozonedepletion	``	establishment	''	meetings	,	of	which	I	have	attended	many	*T*-1	.
It	seems	to	me	that	such	measurements	are	a	vital	part	of	any	intellectually	honest	evaluation	of	the	threat	posed	*	by	CFCs	.
While	*-1	recognizing	that	professional	environmentalists	may	feel	threatened	,	I	intend	*-1	to	urge	that	UV-B	be	monitored	*-2	whenever	I	can	*?*	*T*-3	.

The	relationship	between	surface	release	of	CFCs	and	global	stratospheric	ozone	loss	was	identified	*-1	back	in	1974	.
Although	,	like	all	scientific	theories	,	it	had	its	initial	opponents	,	few	experts	question	the	connection	now	.
The	discovery	of	the	ozone	``	hole	''	over	Antarctica	and	the	results	of	ground-based	and	high-altitude	aircraft	experiments	conducted	*	over	the	past	several	years	serve	as	evidence	that	ozone	depletion	is	related	*-1	to	CFC	concentrations	.
In	the	September	issue	of	Scientific	American	,	Thomas	E.	Graedel	,	distinguished	member	of	the	technical	staff	at	AT&T	Bell	Laboratories	,	and	Paul	J.	Crutzen	,	director	of	the	air	chemistry	division	of	the	Max	Planck	Institute	for	Chemistry	in	Mainz	,	West	Germany	,	wrote	,	``	It	*EXP*-1	is	now	quite	evident	that	chlorofluorocarbons	,	particularly	CFC-11	and	CFC-12	are	the	major	culprits	responsible	for	ozone	depletion	.	''
Mr.	Melloan	quotes	Peter	Teagan	and	invokes	the	name	of	Arthur	D.	Little	Inc.	*	to	support	his	statement	.
However	,	unlike	Messrs.	Graedel	and	Crutzen	,	who	*T*-176	are	both	pioneers	in	the	study	of	atmospheric	chemistry	,	Mr.	Teagan	has	no	special	expertise	in	the	area	.
He	is	a	mechanical	engineer	,	not	an	atmospheric	chemist	.
It	*EXP*-1	is	insulting	and	demeaning	*	to	say	that	scientists	``	needed	new	crises	*	to	generate	new	grants	and	contracts	''	and	that	environmental	groups	need	them	*-2	to	stay	in	business	.

Nearly	two	months	after	*-1	saying	0	it	had	been	the	victim	of	widespread	fraud	,	MiniScribe	Corp.	disclosed	0	it	had	a	negative	net	worth	of	$	88	million	*U*	as	of	July	2	and	hinted	that	it	might	be	forced	*-2	to	file	for	protection	under	bankruptcy	laws	.
Richard	Rifenburgh	,	chairman	and	chief	executive	of	the	Longmont	,	Colo.	,	disk-drive	maker	,	also	said	0	the	company	continued	*-1	losing	money	in	the	third	quarter	and	expects	*-1	to	sustain	further	losses	through	the	end	of	the	year	.
Mr.	Rifenburgh	told	industry	analysts	0	he	is	moving	``	aggressively	''	*	to	negotiate	out-of-court	settlements	on	a	number	of	shareholder	lawsuits	,	but	noted	that	the	company	could	file	for	bankruptcy-law	protection	if	settlement	talks	fail	.
Mr.	Rifenburgh	also	noted	that	150	million	shares	of	MiniScribe	common	stock	were	traded	*-1	during	the	past	three	years	,	``	so	there	's	a	tremendous	amount	of	exposure	.	''
MiniScribe	has	said	that	its	financial	results	for	the	past	three	fiscal	years	would	have	*-1	to	be	restated	*-2	because	of	the	allegedly	fraudulent	accounting	and	marketing	practices	that	*T*-177	inflated	revenues	and	net	income	.
MiniScribe	also	has	n't	filed	any	financial	statements	for	1989	.
Mr.	Rifenburgh	said	0	such	statements	should	be	ready	by	the	end	of	November	.
He	said	0	he	expects	the	company	to	have	$	500	million	*U*	in	sales	for	this	year	.
He	did	n't	say	what	the	company	expected	*-1	to	report	*T*-2	for	year-earlier	sales	,	which	*T*-178	will	be	restated	*-3	from	the	previously	reported	$	603	million	*U*	.
The	release	of	MiniScribe	's	new	balance	sheet	came	one	day	after	it	introduced	its	new	line	of	one-inch	disk	drives	,	on	which	it	is	pinning	much	of	its	hope	for	survival	*T*-1	.
Although	it	is	not	the	first	company	0	*T*-2	to	produce	the	thinner	drives	,	which	*T*-179	store	information	in	personal	computers	,	MiniScribe	says	0	it	is	the	first	with	an	80-megabyte	drive	;	the	company	plans	*-1	to	introduce	a	120-megabyte	drive	next	year	.
Analysts	and	consultants	had	mixed	reactions	to	yesterday	's	announcements	,	*-1	praising	Mr.	Rifenburgh	's	efforts	but	questioning	whether	the	company	can	survive	in	a	highly	competitive	marketplace	.
``	It	's	a	wait-and-see	attitude	,	''	said	*T*-1	Dave	Vellante	,	vice	president	of	storage	research	for	International	Data	Corp	.
Others	pointed	out	that	at	least	four	other	disk-drive	makers	will	have	competitive	one-inch	drives	early	next	year	and	that	the	industry	already	operates	on	very	thin	margins	.
The	company	also	faces	delisting	by	the	National	Association	of	Securities	Dealers	.
The	company	continues	*-1	to	trade	in	the	over-the-counter	market	with	an	exception	to	listing	requirements	.
MiniScribe	filed	a	status	report	*ICH*-1	with	the	NASD	on	Monday	,	detailing	its	efforts	*	to	comply	with	listing	requirements	and	requesting	an	extension	of	the	exception	,	but	has	n't	received	a	response	.
MiniScribe	common	closed	yesterday	at	$	1.9375	*U*	,	down	6.25	cents	,	and	has	been	trading	for	several	months	at	less	than	$	3	*U*	a	share	.
Meanwhile	,	U.S.	Attorney	Jerry	Rafferty	in	Denver	is	reviewing	the	report	prepared	*	by	MiniScribe	's	outside	directors	,	*-1	to	determine	if	criminal	charges	should	be	brought	*-2	before	a	grand	jury	.

The	internal	investigation	also	criticized	MiniScribe	's	auditors	,	Coopers	&	Lybrand	,	for	*-1	allegedly	ignoring	numerous	red	flags	.
Mr.	Rifenburgh	said	0	the	board	still	has	n't	acted	on	most	of	the	internal	report	's	recommendations	,	*	pending	restatement	of	the	balance	sheet	.
He	added	that	he	expects	*-2	to	make	a	recommendation	*ICH*-1	within	a	few	weeks	on	whether	MiniScribe	should	file	its	own	lawsuits	against	former	company	officers	and	directors	.

But	,	by	*-1	allowing	BT	Securities	Inc.	to	handle	private	placements	,	the	Fed	boosted	the	volume	of	new	types	of	underwriting	that	the	unit	can	do	*T*-186	.
Private	placements	involve	debt	and	equity	securities	,	typically	in	denominations	of	$	1	million	*U*	,	that	*T*-187	are	sold	*-1	to	institutional	investors	and	are	n't	registered	*-1	with	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	.
Last	year	,	Bankers	Trust	said	0	it	placed	$	10	billion	*U*	of	corporate	debt	and	equities	privately	.
Companies	listed	*	below	reported	quarterly	profit	substantially	different	from	the	average	of	analysts	'	estimates	.
The	companies	are	followed	*-1	by	at	least	three	analysts	,	and	had	a	minimum	five-cent	change	in	actual	earnings	per	share	.
Estimated	and	actual	results	involving	losses	are	omitted	*-1	.
The	percent	difference	compares	actual	profit	with	the	30-day	estimate	where	at	least	three	analysts	have	issues	forecasts	in	the	past	30	days	*T*-1	.
Otherwise	,	actual	profit	is	compared	*-1	with	the	300-day	estimate	.
Bonnie	J.	Stedt	was	named	*-1	an	executive	vice	president	of	the	American	Express	Travel	Related	Services	Co.	unit	of	this	travel	and	financial	services	firm	.
She	retains	her	duties	of	human-resources	director	.
Joe	F.	Lynch	,	the	56-year-old	chairman	and	chief	executive	officer	of	First	Continental	Real	Estate	Investment	Trust	,	was	named	*-1	to	the	new	post	of	vice	chairman	of	this	bank	holding	company	.
Every	workday	at	11	a.m.	,	40-year-old	Mike	Sinyard	dons	cycling	clothes	,	hops	on	a	bike	0	he	keeps	*T*-1	at	his	Morgan	Hill	,	Calif.	,	office	and	sets	out	*	to	cover	a	distance	0	most	people	would	travel	*T*-2	only	by	car	.
As	many	as	50	of	his	employees	at	Specialized	Bicycle	Components	Inc.	ride	with	him	.
When	they	return	to	their	desks	at	1	p.m.	*T*-1	,	they	have	pedaled	20	miles	.
Such	fervor	for	cycling	helped	Mr.	Sinyard	build	a	creative	company	at	the	forefront	of	its	industry	.
*-2	Founded	*-1	by	bike	enthusiasts	rather	than	businessmen	,	Specialized	spotted	the	appeal	of	fat-tired	bikes	that	*T*-188	go	almost	anywhere	and	began	*-2	mass-producing	them	in	1981	.
In	the	past	five	years	,	the	company	's	sales	have	grown	to	$	80	million	*U*	from	$	26	million	*U*	.
Today	,	so-called	mountain	bikes	account	for	two-thirds	of	the	$	2	billion	*U*	spent	*	annually	on	all	bicycles	in	the	U.S.	.
With	65	%	of	its	sales	coming	from	mountain	bikes	,	Specialized	is	widely	considered	*-1	to	be	a	market	leader	.
-LRB-	Accessories	,	largely	for	mountain-bike	users	,	account	for	much	of	the	rest	of	sales	.	-RRB-
But	today	,	the	company	needs	its	entrepreneurial	spirit	more	than	ever	.
One	large	competitor	after	another	is	leaping	into	the	booming	market	0	Specialized	helped	*-2	create	*T*-1	,	*-3	turning	out	mountain	bikes	with	such	well-known	names	as	Schwinn	,	Peugeot	,	Raleigh	and	Nishiki	.
Thus	,	Mr.	Sinyard	's	company	must	innovate	more	than	ever	*-1	to	stay	ahead	of	them	,	by	*-1	developing	new	products	specifically	for	mountain	biking	.
At	the	same	time	,	though	,	it	must	become	more	structured	*-1	to	better	manage	its	growth	.
*	Accomplishing	both	will	be	a	balancing	act	as	challenging	as	*	riding	a	unicycle	.
It	is	a	problem	common	to	small	companies	that	*T*-189	have	grown	fast	--	especially	when	their	success	attracts	big-time	competitors	*T*-1	.
``	The	big	word	around	Specialized	is	passion	,	''	says	*T*-1	Erik	Eidsmo	,	a	former	ski-industry	executive	whom	Mr.	Sinyard	recruited	*T*-190	from	Citicorp	*-2	to	run	marketing	and	sales	.
``	What	I	hope	*-1	to	bring	*T*-2	to	this	is	another	word	:	process	.
That	's	my	challenge	.
It	's	Mike	's	challenge	as	well	.	''
Mr.	Eidsmo	is	one	of	several	key	people	from	outside	the	cycling	industry	who	*T*-191	were	hired	*-1	*-2	to	bring	the	free-wheeling	,	fast-growing	company	under	tighter	control	.
``	We	had	a	lot	of	problems	,	''	Mr.	Sinyard	says	*T*-1	.
While	the	company	's	sales	were	soaring	,	``	We	still	had	a	system	that	*T*-192	was	probably	appropriate	for	$	10	million	to	$	20	million	*U*	in	sales	.	''
Adds	*T*-1	Mr.	Eidsmo	,	``	What	*T*-193	felt	good	that	day	was	done	that	day	.	''
Since	his	arrival	in	May	,	Mr.	Eidsmo	has	put	in	place	techniques	learned	*	while	*-1	working	for	Citicorp	,	such	as	management-by-objective	,	detailed	project	plans	and	forecasts	of	company	sales	and	product	trends	.
``	We	're	finally	getting	--	and	it	's	been	very	painful	--	some	understanding	of	what	the	company	's	long-term	horizon	should	begin	*-1	to	look	like	*T*-2	,	''	Mr.	Eidsmo	says	*T*-3	.
``	But	it	's	risky	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	of	Specialized	's	attempt	*	to	adopt	a	corporate	structure	.
``	You	do	n't	want	*-1	to	lose	the	magic	''	of	the	company	's	creative	drive	.
*-2	Hoping	*-1	to	stay	ahead	of	the	pack	,	the	company	is	emphasizing	innovation	.
At	a	recent	trade	show	,	convention-goers	lined	up	*-1	to	view	a	new	Specialized	bike	frame	that	*T*-194	weighs	just	2.7	pounds	--	a	pound	less	than	the	lightest	mountain-bike	frame	on	the	market	*?*	.
By	*-1	replacing	the	frame	's	steel	lugs	with	titanium	ones	,	Mr.	Sinyard	's	company	plans	*-1	to	make	its	next	generation	of	frames	even	lighter	.
At	the	trade	show	,	Specialized	also	unveiled	a	revolutionary	three-spoked	bike	wheel	developed	*	jointly	by	Specialized	and	Du	Pont	Co	.
*-2	Made	*-1	of	space-age	materials	,	the	wheel	spokes	are	designed	like	airplane	wings	*-2	to	shave	10	minutes	off	the	time	of	a	rider	in	a	100-mile	race	,	the	company	claims	0	*T*-3	.
It	currently	costs	$	750	*U*	,	though	Mr.	Sinyard	thinks	0	the	price	can	be	reduced	*-1	within	three	years	to	between	$	200	and	$	250	*U*	.
He	was	able	*-1	to	slash	the	price	of	the	company	's	least	expensive	mountain	bike	to	$	279	*U*	from	$	750	*U*	in
But	demands	on	the	company	's	creativity	are	certain	*-1	to	grow	.
Competition	is	intensifying	as	larger	companies	invade	a	mountain-bike	market	0	Mr.	Sinyard	's	company	once	had	*T*-1	virtually	all	to	itself	.
U.S.	Cycling	Federation	official	Philip	Milburn	says	0	mountain	biking	is	``	growing	at	such	a	monstrous	rate	that	a	lot	of	companies	are	getting	into	this	.	''
One	especially	coveted	Specialized	market	0	the	new	players	are	targeting	*T*-1	is	mountain-bike	accessories	,	which	Mr.	Eidsmo	calls	*T*-2	``	the	future	of	our	business	.	''
Accessories	not	only	sell	faster	than	whole	bikes	,	they	also	offer	profit	margins	nearly	double	the	25	%	to	30	%	or	so	*U*	on	sales	of	complete	cycles	.
*-1	To	get	a	piece	of	the	business	,	Nike	Inc.	,	Beaverton	,	Ore.	,	introduced	a	line	of	mountain-bike	shoes	.
About	a	month	ago	,	Michelin	Tire	Corp.	,	Greenville	,	S.C.	,	began	*-1	selling	mountain-bike	tires	,	for	years	a	Specialized	stronghold	.
Competition	in	the	sale	of	complete	bikes	is	heating	up	too	.
Trek	Bicycle	Corp.	,	which	*T*-195	accounts	for	one-quarter	of	the	$	400	million	*U*	in	annual	sales	at	its	Milwaukee-based	parent	,	Intrepid	Corp.	,	entered	the	mountain-bike	business	in	1983	.
Trek	previously	made	only	traditional	road	bikes	,	but	``	it	*EXP*-2	did	n't	take	a	rocket	scientist	*	to	change	a	road	bike	into	a	mountain	bike	,	''	says	*T*-1	Trek	's	president	,	Dick	Burke	.
The	segment	now	makes	up	roughly	two-thirds	of	his	company	's	total	sales	.
At	Giant	Bicycle	Inc.	,	Rancho	Dominguez	,	Calif.	,	sales	have	tripled	since	the	company	entered	the	U.S.	mountain-bike	business	in	1987	.
A	subsidiary	of	a	Taiwanese	holding	company	with	world-wide	sales	of	$	150	million	*U*	,	Giant	*T*-1	is	one	example	of	the	sudden	globalization	of	Mr.	Sinyard	's	once-cozy	market	niche	.
Schwinn	Bicycle	Co.	,	Chicago	,	established	joint	ventures	with	bike	companies	in	mainland	China	and	Hungary	*-1	to	sell	bikes	.
In	the	past	year	,	Derby	International	Corp.	,	Luxembourg	,	has	acquired	such	major	brands	as	Peugeot	,	Raleigh	and	Nishiki	.
In	response	to	the	internationalization	of	the	business	,	Mr.	Sinyard	's	company	is	replacing	independent	distributors	overseas	with	wholly	owned	subsidiaries	.
The	move	will	cut	out	the	cost	of	a	middleman	and	give	Specialized	more	control	over	marketing	and	sales	.
But	as	Bill	Austin	,	Giant	's	president	,	puts	it	*T*-1	,	``	With	some	of	the	bigger	players	consolidating	their	strength	,	the	game	has	changed	.
Carl	E.	Pfeiffer	,	chief	executive	officer	,	was	named	*-1	to	the	additional	post	of	chairman	of	this	specialty-metals	manufacturing	concern	.
Robert	C.	Snyder	,	a	director	and	chief	operating	officer	of	the	company	,	succeeds	Mr.	Pfeiffer	as	president	.
Roger	M.	Marino	,	president	,	was	named	*-1	to	the	new	post	of	vice	chairman	.

Richard	J.	Riordan	was	elected	*-1	a	director	of	this	single-family	home	builder	,	*	increasing	the	board	to	nine	.
He	is	a	senior	partner	with	the	law	firm	of	Riordan	&	McKinzie	and	is	a	partner	in	Riordan	Venture	Management	.
John	Franco	,	47	years	old	,	formerly	vice	chairman	of	Capital	Holding	Corp.	and	president	of	its	Accumulation	Investment	Group	,	was	named	*-1	chief	executive	officer	of	this	insurance	holding	company	,	effective	Dec.	1	,	*-1	succeeding	Robert	T.	Shaw	,	who	*T*-197	remains	chairman	.
I.C.H.	also	named	Steven	B.	Bing	,	42	,	senior	vice	president	since	1986	,	as	president	,	*-3	succeeding	John	W.	Gardiner	,	who	*T*-198	will	join	the	HMS	Acquisition	Corp.	division	of	Hicks	,	Muse	&	Co.	,	which	*T*-199	has	agreed	*-2	to	buy	most	of	I.C.H.	's	Denver-based	subsidiaries	.
MCI	Communications	Corp.	said	0	it	won	a	$	27	million	*U*	contract	*ICH*-1	from	Stuart-James	Co.	,	a	Denver	investment	banking	concern	,	*	to	provide	voice	and	data	telecommunications	services	.
The	agreement	calls	for	MCI	to	provide	data	service	,	800	and	Vnet	service	,	a	virtual	private	network	service	.
The	companies	would	n't	disclose	the	length	of	the	contract	except	*-1	to	say	0	it	was	a	multiyear	agreement	.

He	said	0	he	believes	0	the	bank	loan	,	0	*T*-1	to	be	arranged	*-2	by	February	,	will	supply	about	half	of	the	financing	.
British	Satellite	,	which	already	*T*-200	has	raised	#	423.5	million	*U*	from	10	backers	,	initially	expected	*-1	to	seek	an	additional	#	400	million	*U*	.
Mr.	Simonds-Gooding	said	0	the	additional	financing	may	leave	British	Satellite	owned	*-1	by	about	20	investors	,	including	Australian	entrepreneur	Alan	Bond	,	whose	nearly	36	%	stake	*T*-201	would	be	reduced	*-2	to	as	little	as	20	%	.
Bond	Corp.	,	British	Satellite	's	biggest	investor	,	would	like	*-1	to	withdraw	from	the	satellite-TV	consortium	,	and	analysts	have	speculated	0	Hollywood	studios	might	buy	the	Bond	stake	.
But	Mr.	Simonds-Gooding	said	0	he	is	n't	talking	to	any	studios	about	investing	.
Besides	Bond	Corp.	,	British	Satellite	's	other	backers	include	Pearson	PLC	,	Reed	International	PLC	and	Granada	Group	PLC	.
The	consortium	faced	a	setback	in	May	when	technical	problems	forced	it	to	postpone	the	September	launch	until	next	spring	*T*-1	.
Continued	uncertainty	about	the	timing	of	the	consortium	's	debut	could	make	it	*EXP*-1	hard	*	to	find	a	#	450	million	*U*	cash	injection	.
Mr.	Simonds-Gooding	conceded	that	British	Satellite	's	potential	U.K.	lenders	``	are	saying	,	`	When	you	're	on	the	air	*T*-1	,	you	'll	-LCB-	actually	-RCB-	get	the	money	.	'	''
The	bankers	also	insist	that	the	loans	depend	on	the	consortium	raising	more	money	from	new	and	existing	backers	.
British	Satellite	today	is	unveiling	a	#	30	million	*U*	advertising	and	promotional	drive	for	the	consortium	's	planned	five	channels	of	movies	,	sports	,	entertainment	and	news	shows	.

Turnover	was	also	down	substantially	from	840.8	million	shares	on	Friday	.
Dealers	said	0	the	market	was	supported	*-1	to	some	extent	by	a	firmer	pound	,	gains	on	Wall	Street	and	shopping	by	market-makers	*	to	cover	internal	requirements	for	selected	stocks	in	the	100-share	index	.
Dealers	attributed	most	of	the	day	's	gains	to	market-makers	moving	prices	higher	,	rather	than	an	outbreak	of	significant	buying	interest	.
Prices	were	up	across	the	board	,	with	most	blue-chip	stocks	registering	solid	gains	.
Though	the	market	was	stronger	,	dealers	said	0	fresh	buying	interest	was	sidelined	*-1	ahead	of	a	potential	market-affecting	debate	in	the	House	of	Commons	set	*	for	Tuesday	.

The	energy	of	participating	investors	streamed	into	Tokyu	Group	shares	,	*-1	pushing	prices	of	its	companies	up	across	the	board	.
Tokyu	Group	announced	during	the	weekend	that	each	Group	company	will	buy	the	others	'	stocks	*-1	to	defend	themselves	against	a	rumored	takeover	.

Tokyu	Construction	gained	170	to	1610	.
Other	winners	Monday	included	nonferrous	metals	,	which	*T*-207	attracted	investors	because	of	a	surge	in	gold	prices	on	the	back	of	the	unstable	dollar	.
Petroleum	companies	were	also	popular	because	of	expectations	of	a	weaker	dollar	,	which	*T*-208	cuts	dollar-denominated	crude-oil	prices	.

Deere	&	Co.	said	0	it	reached	a	tentative	agreement	with	the	machinists	'	union	at	its	Horicon	,	Wis.	,	plant	,	*	ending	a	month-old	strike	by	workers	*PPA*-1	at	the	facility	.
The	maker	of	farm	equipment	said	0	the	three-year	labor	agreement	with	the	International	Association	of	Machinists	and	Aerospace	Workers	at	John	Deere	Horicon	Works	,	Deere	's	primary	facility	for	*	producing	lawn	and	grounds-care	equipment	,	takes	effect	immediately	and	extends	through	Oct.	1	,	1992	.
About	1,150	employees	are	covered	*-1	by	the	new	agreement	,	Deere	said	0	*T*-2	.
Courtaulds	PLC	announced	plans	*	to	spin	off	its	textiles	operations	to	existing	shareholders	in	a	restructuring	*	to	boost	shareholder	value	.
The	British	chemical	and	textile	company	's	plan	,	which	*T*-210	requires	shareholder	approval	,	would	create	a	new	,	listed	U.K.	stock	with	a	probable	market	capitalization	between	#	300	million	*U*	-LRB-	$	473	million	*U*	-RRB-	and	#	400	million	*U*	,	analysts	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	establishment	of	the	separate	company	,	0	*T*-1	to	be	called	*-2	Courtaulds	Textiles	,	could	be	effective	as	early	as	next	year	's	first	quarter	.
Investors	welcomed	the	move	.
Courtaulds	'	shares	rose	15	pence	to	362	pence	,	*-1	valuing	the	entire	company	at	about	#	1.44	billion	*U*	.
Courtaulds	'	spinoff	reflects	pressure	*ICH*-1	on	British	industry	*	to	boost	share	prices	beyond	the	reach	of	corporate	raiders	.
Courtaulds	'	restructuring	is	among	the	largest	thus	far	in	Britain	,	though	it	is	dwarfed	*-1	by	B.A.T	Industries	PLC	's	plans	*	to	spin	off	roughly	#	4	billion	*U*	in	assets	*	to	help	*-2	fend	off	a	takeover	bid	from	Anglo-French	financier	Sir	James	Goldsmith	.
The	divested	Courtaulds	textile	operations	had	operating	profit	of	#	50	million	*U*	on	#	980	million	*U*	in	revenue	in	the	year	ended	March	31	.
Some	analysts	have	said	0	Courtaulds	'	moves	could	boost	the	company	's	value	by	5	%	to	10	%	,	because	the	two	entities	separately	will	carry	a	higher	price	earnings	multiple	than	they	did	*?*	combined	.
In	addition	,	Courtaulds	said	0	the	moves	are	logical	because	they	will	allow	both	the	chemicals	and	textile	businesses	to	focus	more	closely	on	core	activities	.
Courtaulds	has	been	under	pressure	*	to	enhance	shareholder	value	since	takeover	speculators	--	including	Australian	financier	Kerry	Packer	--	surfaced	*-1	holding	small	stakes	last	year	.
Though	Mr.	Packer	has	since	sold	his	stake	,	Courtaulds	is	moving	*-1	to	keep	its	institutional	shareholders	happy	.
Even	without	a	specific	takeover	threat	,	Courtaulds	is	giving	shareholders	``	choice	and	value	,	''	said	0	*T*-1	Julia	Blake	,	an	analyst	at	London	stockbrokers	Barclays	de	Zoete	Wedd	.
In	a	statement	,	the	company	said	:	``	Both	parts	can	only	realize	their	full	potential	and	be	appropriately	valued	*-1	by	the	market	if	they	are	separately	quoted	companies	.
The	sharper	definition	and	the	autonomy	which	each	will	thereby	gain	*T*-1	will	benefit	shareholders	,	customers	and	employees	.	''
Courtaulds	Chairman	and	Chief	Executive	Sir	Christopher	Hogg	will	remain	in	both	posts	at	the	surviving	chemical	company	after	the	spinoff	.
Sanwa	Shutter	Corp.	said	0	its	affiliated	company	in	Malaysia	,	established	*	this	April	,	will	begin	*-1	manufacturing	steel	doors	Wednesday	.
Its	partner	in	the	joint	venture	is	Sin	Kean	Boon	Metal	Industries	,	Penang	,	Malaysia	.
Company	officials	said	0	the	new	company	,	Sin	Kean	Boon-Sanwa	-LRB-	J.V	.	-RRB-	is	capitalized	*-1	at	the	equivalent	of	54	million	yen	-LRB-	$	381,000	*U*	-RRB-	.
The	Japanese	concern	has	a	40	%	stake	,	while	the	local	partner	has	a	60	%	stake	.
The	new	company	was	created	*-1	*	to	meet	growing	demand	for	steel	doors	,	concurrent	with	increasing	local	concern	about	fire	prevention	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-2	.
Barbara	Hackman	Franklin	,	president	of	Franklin	Associates	,	was	elected	*-1	a	director	of	this	building	products	maker	.
Ms.	Franklin	,	49	years	old	,	fills	the	position	vacated	*	by	Naomi	G.	Albanese	,	who	*T*-211	retired	earlier	this	year	at	age	72	.
NEC	Corp.	said	0	it	plans	*	to	more	than	double	its	British	subsidiary	's	capacity	for	the	production	of	semiconductor	wafers	.
Officials	at	the	Japanese	semiconductor	maker	said	0	the	company	intends	*-1	to	increase	investment	in	plant	and	equipment	by	10	billion	yen	-LRB-	$	70.6	million	*U*	-RRB-	,	to	90	billion	yen	,	in	the	year	ending	March	31	,	with	the	extra	funds	used	*	to	increase	production	overseas	.
Officials	said	0	they	were	n't	sure	how	the	money	will	be	distributed	*-1	among	overseas	units	*T*-2	,	but	added	that	NEC	Semiconductors	U.K.	Ltd.	will	receive	priority	.
Officials	also	disclosed	0	it	*EXP*-1	's	possible	that	NEC	may	reduce	domestic	production	of	one-megabit	chips	to	five	million	a	month	from	six	million	,	*	beginning	January	,	because	of	deteriorating	market	prices	.
Japan	's	steel	exports	fell	12.2	%	in	September	from	a	year	earlier	and	were	down	1.1	%	from	the	previous	month	,	the	Japan	Iron	and	Steel	Federation	reported	0	*T*-1	.
September	was	the	10th	consecutive	month	in	which	steel	exports	failed	*-2	to	reach	the	year-earlier	level	*T*-1	.
A	federation	official	attributed	the	decline	to	brisk	demand	from	domestic	industries	backed	*	by	continuing	economic	expansion	in	Japan	.
Japanese	steel	companies	are	apparently	focusing	on	domestic	sales	,	but	the	official	said	0	it	does	n't	necessarily	mean	that	local	sales	contracts	are	increasing	that	markedly	.
``	They	are	just	too	busy	0	*T*-2	to	meet	domestic	demand	and	have	little	room	for	overseas	shipments	,	''	the	official	said	*T*-1	.
After	a	bad	start	,	Treasury	bonds	were	buoyed	*-1	by	a	late	burst	of	buying	*-1	to	end	modestly	higher	.
``	The	market	was	pretty	dull	''	for	most	of	the	day	,	said	0	*T*-1	Robert	H.	Chandross	,	vice	president	at	Lloyds	Bank	PLC	.
He	said	0	some	investors	were	reluctant	*-1	to	plunge	into	the	market	ahead	of	several	key	economic	indicators	due	this	week	,	especially	Friday	's	potentially	market-moving	employment	report	.
During	the	first	hour	of	trading	yesterday	,	prices	fell	as	much	as	1\/4	point	,	or	down	about	$	2.50	*U*	for	each	$	1,000	*U*	face	amount	.
But	market	activity	was	energized	*-1	as	investors	started	*-2	to	view	the	lower	price	levels	as	attractive	.
And	the	Treasury	's	$	17.6	billion	*U*	auction	of	short-term	bills	,	which	*T*-1	generated	strong	buying	interest	,	helped	*-2	to	lift	the	bond	market	out	of	the	doldrums	.
``	We	saw	good	retail	demand	by	small	banks	,	individuals	and	institutions	and	that	is	one	reason	why	the	market	advanced	''	late	in	the	day	*T*-2	,	said	0	*T*-1	Sung	Won	Sohn	,	senior	vice	president	and	chief	economist	at	Norwest	Corp.	,	Minneapolis	.
He	said	0	the	change	in	sentiment	also	reflected	perceptions	that	the	slate	of	economic	statistic	due	this	week	will	be	``	conducive	to	a	bond	market	rally	.	''
The	employment	report	,	which	*T*-1	will	provide	the	first	official	measure	of	the	economy	's	strength	in	October	,	is	expected	*-2	to	show	smaller	gains	in	the	generation	of	new	jobs	.
Other	key	economic	indicators	due	this	week	include	today	's	release	of	the	September	leading	indicators	index	and	new-home	sales	.
Tomorrow	,	the	October	purchasing	managers	report	is	due	and	on	Thursday	comes	October	chain-store	sales	.
Despite	yesterday	's	modest	bond	market	gains	,	economists	say	0	investors	are	anxious	about	the	Treasury	's	huge	quarterly	refunding	of	government	debt	,	the	timing	of	which	*T*-1	depends	on	Congressional	efforts	*	to	raise	the	debt	ceiling	.
Although	the	Treasury	will	announce	details	of	the	November	refunding	tomorrow	,	it	could	be	delayed	*-1	if	Congress	and	President	Bush	fail	*-2	to	increase	the	Treasury	's	borrowing	capacity	.
The	debt	ceiling	is	scheduled	*-1	to	fall	to	$	2.8	trillion	*U*	from	$	2.87	trillion	*U*	at	midnight	tonight	.
The	Treasury	's	benchmark	30-year	bond	rose	1\/8	point	.
Mortgage-backed	securities	were	up	less	than	1\/8	point	and	investment-grade	corporate	bonds	were	unchanged	.
Strong	demand	for	New	York	City	's	$	813	million	*U*	general	obligation	bonds	propped	up	the	municipal	market	.
Traders	said	0	most	municipal	bonds	ended	1\/2	point	higher	.
The	New	York	City	issue	included	$	757	million	*U*	of	tax-exempt	bonds	priced	*	*-1	to	yield	between	6.50	%	to	7.88	%	*U*	,	depending	on	the	maturity	.
The	$	56	million	*U*	of	New	York	's	taxable	general	obligation	bonds	were	priced	*-1	*-2	to	yield	between	9.125	%	to	9.90	%	*U*	.
As	*	expected	,	the	longer-term	tax-exempt	New	York	bonds	had	yields	nearly	as	high	as	those	on	taxable	long-term	Treasury	bonds	.
The	yield	on	the	benchmark	30-year	Treasury	bond	ended	yesterday	at	about	7.92	%	.
Bond	dealers	said	0	the	rates	for	the	long-term	tax-exempt	New	York	City	bonds	were	among	the	highest	,	as	a	percentage	of	Treasury	rates	,	for	any	New	York	City	issue	in	recent	memory	.
A	spokesman	for	New	York	City	Comptroller	Harrison	Goldin	said	0	the	high	rates	reflect	investors	concerns	about	the	city	's	financial	health	and	political	uncertainties	.
New	York	bonds	,	which	*T*-2	have	been	hammered	*-1	in	recent	weeks	on	the	pending	supply	and	reports	that	the	city	's	economy	is	growing	weaker	,	rose	1\/2	point	yesterday	.
Treasury	Securities
Treasury	bonds	ended	slightly	higher	in	light	trading	.
The	benchmark	30-year	bond	ended	at	102	7\/32	0	*T*-2	to	yield	7.92	%	,	compared	with	Friday	's	price	of	102	2\/32	0	*T*-1	to	yield	7.93	%	.
The	latest	10-year	notes	ended	at	about	100	16\/32	0	*T*-1	to	yield	7.90	%	,	compared	with	100	11\/32	0	*T*-2	to	yield	7.93	%	on	Friday	.
Short-term	interest	rates	rose	at	the	government	's	regular	weekly	Treasury-bill	auction	.
The	average	discount	rate	on	three-month	bills	was	7.78	%	and	the	rate	on	six-month	bills	was	7.62	%	.
Those	rates	are	up	from	7.52	%	and	7.50	%	,	respectively	,	at	last	week	's	auction	.
Due	to	the	Treasury	's	need	*	to	raise	funds	quickly	before	the	current	authority	*	to	issue	debt	expires	at	midnight	tonight	,	yesterday	's	auction	was	structured	*-1	differently	from	previous	sales	.
The	Treasury	bills	sold	*	yesterday	settle	today	,	rather	than	the	standard	settlement	day	of	Thursday	.
And	because	of	the	early	settlement	,	the	three-month	bills	actually	have	a	93-day	maturity	,	and	the	six-month	bills	have	an	184-day	maturity	.
Because	of	the	early	settlement	,	the	Federal	Reserve	was	unable	*-1	to	purchase	bills	for	its	system	account	.
However	,	analysts	expect	the	Fed	to	buy	Treasury	bills	that	*T*-2	were	auctioned	*-1	yesterday	in	the	secondary	market	.
The	Treasury	also	held	a	hastily	scheduled	$	2	billion	*U*	sale	of	51-cash	management	bills	yesterday	.
Here	are	*T*-1	details	of	yesterday	's	three-month	and	six-month	bill	auction	:
Rates	are	determined	*-1	by	the	difference	between	the	purchase	price	and	face	value	.
Thus	,	higher	bidding	narrows	the	investor	's	return	while	lower	bidding	widens	it	.
The	percentage	rates	are	calculated	*-1	on	a	360-day	year	,	while	the	coupon	equivalent	yield	is	based	*-2	on	a	365-day	year	.
Both	issues	are	dated	*-1	Oct.	31	.
The	13-week	bills	mature	Feb.	1	,	and	the	26-week	bills	mature	May	3	,	1990	.
Here	are	*T*-1	details	of	yesterday	's	51-day	cash	management	bill	auction	:
Interest	rate	8.07	%
The	bills	are	dated	Oct.	31	and	mature	Dec.	21	,	1989	.
Corporate	Issues
The	junk	bond	prices	of	Western	Union	Corp.	tumbled	after	the	company	said	0	it	wo	n't	proceed	with	an	exchange	offer	to	holders	of	its	reset	notes	.
The	Upper	Saddle	River	,	N.J.	,	communications	firm	said	0	it	is	considering	alternatives	to	the	restructuring	of	the	senior	secured	notes	because	of	changes	in	the	high-yield	market	.
In	June	,	Western	Union	was	forced	*-2	to	reset	the	interest	rate	on	the	senior	secured	notes	due	in	1992	to	19	1\/4	%	from	16	1\/2	%	,	a	move	which	*T*-1	increased	the	firm	's	annual	interest	payments	by	$	13.8	million	*U*	.
Although	the	notes	held	at	a	price	of	92	to	93	immediately	after	the	reset	,	they	started	*-1	falling	soon	afterward	.
Yesterday	,	Western	Union	's	senior	secured	reset	notes	fell	3	3\/4	points	,	or	about	$	37.50	*U*	for	each	$	1,000	*U*	face	amount	,	*-1	to	close	at	50	1\/4	.
Other	Western	Union	securities	were	also	lower	.
The	company	's	7.90	%	sinking	fund	debentures	were	quoted	*-1	at	a	bid	price	of	14	1\/4	and	an	offered	price	of	30	,	while	the	10	3\/4	%	subordinated	debentures	of	1997	were	being	bid	for	*-2	at	28	and	offered	*-2	at	around	34	3\/4	.
The	10	3\/4	%	debentures	last	traded	at	35	.
High-yield	traders	said	0	spreads	between	the	bid	and	offered	prices	of	Western	Union	junk	bonds	have	been	widening	for	some	time	,	and	in	certain	cases	,	bids	for	Western	Union	securities	are	not	available	.
Elsewhere	,	prices	of	investment-grade	and	high-risk	,	high-yield	junk	bonds	ended	unchanged	.
In	the	new-issue	market	for	junk	securities	,	underwriters	at	Salomon	Brothers	Inc.	are	expected	*-1	to	price	today	a	$	350	million	*U*	junk	bond	offering	by	Beatrice	Co.	.
The	two-part	issue	consists	of	$	200	million	*U*	of	senior	subordinated	reset	notes	maturing	in	1997	and	$	150	million	*U*	of	subordinated	floating	rate	notes	also	maturing	in	1997	.
Portfolio	managers	said	0	expectations	are	for	the	issue	to	be	priced	*-1	at	a	discount	with	a	coupon	of	13	3\/4	%	and	a	yield	of	about	14	%	.
The	Chicago-based	food	and	consumer	goods	concern	was	acquired	*-1	in	April	1986	in	a	$	6.2	billion	*U*	leveraged	buy-out	engineered	*	by	Kohlberg	Kravis	Roberts	&	Co	.
Proceeds	from	the	note	sale	will	be	used	*-1	*	to	repay	a	portion	of	the	bank	borrowings	used	*	by	Beatrice	*	to	redeem	its	$	526.3	million	*U*	principal	amount	of	increasing	rate	debentures	in	August	.
Meanwhile	,	underwriters	at	Morgan	Stanley	&	Co.	are	expected	today	*-1	to	price	a	$	350	million	*U*	high-yield	offering	by	Continental	Cablevision	Inc	.
The	senior	subordinated	debentures	maturing	in	2004	are	targeted	*-2	to	be	offered	*-1	at	a	yield	of	between	12	5\/8	%	to	12	3\/4	%	*U*	.
Mortgage-Backed	Securities
Mortgage	securities	ended	2\/32	to	4\/32	higher	in	light	trading	.
Ginnie	Mae	's	9	%	issue	for	November	delivery	finished	at	98	1\/2	,	up	4\/32	,	and	its	10	%	issue	at	102	3\/8	,	up	4\/32	.
Freddie	Mac	's	9	%	issue	ended	at	97	19\/32	,	up	2\/32	.
In	the	derivative	market	,	insurance	companies	have	scaled	back	their	purchases	of	Remic	securities	,	or	real	estate	mortgage	investment	conduits	,	as	they	assess	potential	claims	from	the	recent	California	earthquake	and	hurricane	in	the	Carolinas	.
This	could	mean	diminished	issuance	of	derivative	mortgage	issues	during	the	next	few	weeks	.
Insurance	companies	have	been	major	buyers	of	prepayment-protected	planned	amortization	classes	-LRB-	PACs	-RRB-	during	the	past	few	months	.
The	PACs	appeal	to	insurance	companies	and	other	investors	because	they	have	higher	yields	than	topgrade	corporate	bonds	and	carry	the	guarantee	of	Freddie	Mac	and	Fannie	Mae	,	quasi-federal	agencies	.
In	the	asset-backed	market	,	Beneficial	Corp.	offered	$	248	million	*U*	of	securities	backed	*	by	home-equity	loans	,	the	second	large	deal	in	the	past	week	.
Last	week	,	a	unit	of	MNC	Financial	Corp.	offered	$	268	million	*U*	of	home-equity	securities	.
Both	the	MNC	and	Beneficial	offering	were	underwritten	*-2	by	Merrill	Lynch	Capital	Markets	,	the	leading	Wall	Street	firm	in	the	home-equity	securities	market	,	which	*T*-3	was	created	*-1	early	this	year	.
Municipal	Issues
The	improved	tone	in	the	municipal	market	,	largely	an	offshoot	of	the	New	York	City	sale	's	reception	,	helped	municipal	futures	rebound	from	early	lows	,	but	the	spread	between	the	contract	and	Tbond	futures	continued	*-1	to	grow	more	negative	.
The	MOB	spread	,	or	difference	between	the	municipal	and	T-bond	futures	contracts	,	has	been	near	all-time	lows	in	recent	trading	,	*-1	driven	*-2	basically	by	concerns	that	new-issue	supply	would	overwhelm	demand	.
December	municipal	futures	ended	up	11\/32	point	to	92-14	,	*-1	having	pulled	off	a	morning	low	of	91-23	as	cash	municipals	rebounded	.
But	front	month	T-bond	futures	settled	the	afternoon	session	up	a	slightly	greater	13\/32	at	99-04	.
Foreign	Bonds
British	government	bonds	ended	moderately	higher	,	*-1	encouraged	*-2	by	a	steadier	pound	and	a	rise	in	British	stocks	.
The	benchmark	11	3\/4	%	bond	due	2003\/2007	rose	10\/32	to	111	14\/32	*-1	to	yield	10.14	%	,	while	the	Treasury	's	12	%	notes	due	1995	rose	7\/32	to	103	5\/8	*-2	to	yield	11.04	%	.
West	German	government	bonds	fell	as	much	as	0.60	point	in	light	,	nervous	trading	.
The	7	%	Treasury	bond	due	October	1999	ended	off	0.60	point	to	99.35	*-1	to	yield	7.09	%	,	while	the	6	3\/4	%	notes	due	1994	fell	0.35	point	to	97.25	*-2	to	yield	7.45	%	.
Japanese	government	bonds	continued	*-1	to	erode	as	the	dollar	remained	resilient	against	the	yen	.
Japan	's	No.	111	4.6	%	bond	due	1998	ended	the	day	on	brokers	screens	at	95.11	*-1	to	yield	5.43	%	.
So-called	cross-border	acquisitions	totaled	$	23.1	billion	*U*	in	the	second	quarter	,	down	from	$	33.6	billion	*U*	a	year	earlier	,	according	to	the	accounting	firm	KPMG	Peat	Marwick	.
In	a	cross-border	transaction	,	the	buyer	is	in	a	different	region	of	the	globe	from	the	target	.
Such	transactions	numbered	670	in	the	second	quarter	,	up	from	527	a	year	earlier	.
However	,	the	total	value	declined	for	deals	of	$	100	million	and	up	*U*	.
The	downturn	in	total	value	may	be	only	temporary	,	suggested	0	*T*-1	Herb	Adler	,	a	KPMG	Peat	Marwick	partner	.
He	explained	,	in	part	,	that	*	restructuring	*-1	to	prepare	for	the	Common	Market	expansion	due	in	1992	``	has	become	more	of	a	strategic	priority	,	both	for	companies	inside	and	outside	the	European	Community	.	''
In	the	second	quarter	,	middle-market	cross-border	transactions	--	deals	under	$	100	million	*U*	each	--	numbered	619	and	totaled	$	6	billion	*U*	,	compared	with	478	such	transactions	totaling	$	4.9	billion	*U*	a	year	earlier	,	the	firm	said	0	*T*-1	.

That	compared	with	49	such	transactions	totaling	$	28.7	billion	*U*	as	year	earlier	.
Rymer	Foods	Inc.	said	0	its	board	authorized	the	purchase	of	as	many	as	500,000	of	its	common	stock	purchase	warrants	at	a	price	of	$	4	*U*	a	warrant	.
The	food	company	,	which	*T*-1	has	720,000	warrants	and	about	2.9	million	common	shares	outstanding	,	said	0	it	may	increase	the	offer	*-3	to	purchase	any	or	all	warrants	that	*T*-2	are	properly	tendered	.
A	warrant	permits	a	holder	to	acquire	one	share	of	common	stock	for	$	17.50	*U*	a	share	.
The	warrants	expire	on	Oct.	15	,	1992	,	and	may	be	called	*-1	by	the	company	at	a	price	of	$	5.25	*U*	.
The	offer	is	scheduled	*-1	to	expire	on	Nov.	28	,	unless	*-1	extended	.

Gen-Probe	Inc.	,	a	biotechnology	concern	,	said	0	it	signed	a	definitive	agreement	*	to	be	acquired	*-1	by	Chugai	Pharmaceutical	Co.	of	Tokyo	for	about	$	110	million	*U*	,	or	almost	double	the	market	price	of	Gen-Probe	's	stock	.
The	move	is	sure	*-1	to	heighten	concerns	about	increased	Japanese	investment	in	U.S.	biotechnology	firms	.
It	is	also	likely	*-1	to	bolster	fears	that	the	Japanese	will	use	their	foothold	in	U.S.	biotechnology	concerns	*-2	to	gain	certain	trade	and	competitive	advantages	.
Gen-Probe	,	an	industry	leader	in	the	field	of	genetic	probes	,	which	*T*-2	is	a	new	technology	used	*	in	diagnostic	tests	,	last	year	signed	an	agreement	for	Chugai	to	exclusively	market	its	diagnostic	products	*ICH*-1	in	Japan	for	infectious	diseases	and	cancer	.
Chugai	agreed	then	*-1	to	fund	certain	associated	research	and	development	costs	.
That	arrangement	apparently	has	worked	well	,	and	Thomas	A.	Bologna	,	president	and	chief	executive	officer	of	Gen-Probe	,	founded	*	in	1983	,	said	0	the	sale	of	the	company	means	0	``	we	will	be	able	*-1	to	concentrate	on	*	running	the	business	rather	than	always	looking	for	sources	of	financing	.	''
Chugai	agreed	*-1	to	pay	$	6.25	*U*	a	share	for	Gen-Probe	's	17.6	million	common	shares	outstanding	on	a	fully	diluted	basis	.
Yesterday	,	in	national	trading	in	the	over-the-counter	market	,	Gen-Probe	common	closed	at	$	3.25	*U*	a	share	.
Because	the	U.S.	leads	in	most	areas	of	biotechnology	--	largely	because	of	research	investment	by	the	U.S.	government	--	the	sale	is	sure	*-1	to	increase	concerns	that	Japanese	companies	will	buy	American	know-how	and	use	it	*-2	to	obtain	the	upper	hand	in	biotechnology	trade	and	competition	.
``	The	biotechnology	firms	may	be	setting	up	their	own	competitors	,	''	said	*T*-1	Richard	Godown	,	president	of	the	Industrial	Biotechnology	Association	.
He	added	that	until	now	the	Japanese	have	only	acquired	equity	positions	in	U.S.	biotechnology	companies	.
``	They	are	piggybacking	onto	developed	technology	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
During	the	past	five	years	,	Japanese	concerns	have	invested	in	several	of	the	U.S.	's	431	independent	biotechnology	companies	.
Chugai	has	been	one	of	the	most	active	Japanese	players	in	U.S.	biotechnology	companies	;	it	has	an	equity	investment	in	Genetics	Institute	Inc.	,	Cambridge	,	Mass.	,	and	a	joint-venture	agreement	with	Upjohn	Co.	,	Kalamazoo	,	Mich	.
The	Japanese	government	,	Mr.	Godown	said	0	*T*-1	,	has	stated	that	it	wants	10	%	to	11	%	*U*	of	its	gross	national	product	to	come	from	biotechnology	products	.
``	It	is	becoming	more	of	a	horse	race	*ICH*-2	every	day	between	the	U.S.	and	Japan	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	,	*-3	adding	that	some	fear	that	as	with	the	semiconductor	,	electronics	,	and	automobile	industries	,	Japanese	companies	will	use	U.S.-developed	technology	*-4	to	gain	trade	advantages	.
Mr.	Bologna	said	0	the	sale	would	allow	Gen-Probe	to	speed	up	the	development	of	new	technology	,	and	to	more	quickly	apply	existing	technology	to	an	array	of	diagnostic	products	0	the	company	wants	*-3	to	offer	*T*-2	.
By	1988	,	when	only	10	genetic	probe-based	tests	of	diagnostic	infectious	diseases	of	humans	had	been	approved	*-2	for	marketing	by	the	Food	and	Drug	Administration	*T*-3	,	eight	of	them	had	been	developed	and	sold	*-4	by	Gen-Probe	.
Osamu	Nagayama	,	deputy	president	of	Chugai	,	which	*T*-1	spends	about	15	%	of	its	sales	on	research	and	development	,	was	unable	*-3	to	pinpoint	how	much	money	Chugai	would	pump	*T*-2	into	Gen-Probe	.
``	We	think	0	Gen-Probe	has	technology	important	to	people	's	health	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	,	*-3	adding	:	``	We	think	0	it	*EXP*-4	is	important	for	us	to	have	such	technology	.	''
He	and	Mr.	Bologna	emphasized	that	both	companies	would	gain	technological	knowledge	through	the	sale	of	Gen-Probe	,	which	*T*-1	will	expand	``	significantly	''	as	a	result	of	the	acquisition	.
In	1988	,	Chugai	had	net	income	of	$	60	million	*U*	on	revenue	of	$	991	million	*U*	.
GenProbe	had	a	net	loss	of	$	9.5	million	*U*	on	revenue	of	$	5.8	million	*U*	.
Recently	,	Gen-Probe	received	a	broad	U.S.	patent	for	a	technology	that	*T*-2	helps	detect	,	identify	and	quantify	non-viral	organisms	through	the	targeting	of	a	form	of	genetic	material	called	*	ribosomal	RNA	.
Among	other	things	,	Mr.	Bologna	said	that	the	sale	will	facilitate	Gen-Probe	's	marketing	of	a	diagnostic	test	for	acquired	immune	deficiency	syndrome	,	or	AIDS	.
Chugai	also	will	help	Gen-Probe	with	its	regulatory	and	marketing	expertise	in	Asia	,	Mr.	Bologna	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	tender	offer	for	Gen-Probe	's	shares	is	expected	*-1	to	begin	next	Monday	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-2	.
It	was	supposed	*-1	to	be	a	routine	courtesy	call	.
A	half-dozen	Soviet	space	officials	,	in	Tokyo	in	July	for	an	exhibit	,	stopped	by	*-1	to	see	their	counterparts	at	the	National	Space	Development	Agency	of	Japan	.
But	after	a	few	pleasantries	,	the	Soviets	unexpectedly	got	serious	.
The	Soviets	have	a	world-leading	space	program	,	the	guests	noted	0	*T*-1	.
Would	n't	the	Japanese	like	a	piece	of	it	?
The	visitors	then	listed	technologies	up	for	sale	,	including	launch	services	and	propulsion	hardware	.
``	We	were	just	surprised	,	''	says	*T*-1	Tad	Inada	,	NASDA	's	director	for	international	affairs	.
``	Shocked	.	''
That	Moscow	,	with	its	dilapidated	economic	machine	,	would	try	*-1	to	sell	high	technology	to	Japan	,	one	of	the	world	's	high-tech	leaders	,	sounds	like	a	coals-to-Newcastle	notion	.
But	``	the	Soviet	Union	has	areas	where	it	is	n't	behind	Japan	*T*-1	,	''	says	*T*-2	Mikhail	Shapovalov	of	the	Soviet	Ministry	of	Foreign	Economic	Relations	.
``	We	have	obtained	through	the	development	of	Cosmos	-LCB-	the	Soviet	space	program	-RCB-	technologies	0	you	do	n't	see	*T*-1	anywhere	else	.	''
The	sales	pitch	might	n't	be	as	farfetched	as	it	seems	*?*	.
Japan-U.S.	trade	relations	are	bumpy	these	days	,	and	some	Japanese	favor	*-3	decreasing	their	reliance	on	U.S.	technology	in	light	of	the	FSX	fighter-plane	flap	,	when	U.S.	officials	reversed	an	earlier	decision	and	refused	*-2	to	share	certain	crucial	fighter-plane	technology	*T*-1	.
And	,	despite	its	image	as	a	technology	superpower	,	Japan	has	a	lot	of	weaknesses	.
It	's	a	world	leader	in	semiconductors	,	but	behind	the	U.S.	in	*	making	the	computers	that	*T*-1	use	those	chips	.
It	's	a	world	leader	in	auto	manufacturing	,	but	its	aviation	industry	is	struggling	,	and	its	space	program	is	years	behind	the	U.S.	,	the	Europeans	and	the	Soviets	.
One	question	being	debated	*	in	the	Soviet	Union	is	how	*	to	use	the	defense	sector	's	research-and-production	expertise	in	the	rest	of	the	economy	*T*-1	.
Many	plants	that	*T*-1	used	*-3	to	make	military	equipment	are	now	being	ordered	*-2	to	produce	televisions	,	videocassette	recorders	,	small	tractors	and	food-processing	machinery	.
The	Soviets	also	hope	*-2	to	make	better	use	of	their	considerable	expertise	in	theoretical	science	,	which	*T*-1	has	helped	them	win	twice	as	many	Nobel	science	prizes	as	the	Japanese	.
Where	they	lag	behind	the	Japanese	*T*-1	is	in	*	turning	the	scientific	inventiveness	into	improved	production	.
By	contrast	,	the	Japanese	have	proved	adept	at	*	making	use	of	Soviet	inventions	.
Kobe	Steel	Ltd.	adopted	Soviet	casting	technology	in	1966	and	used	it	for	14	years	until	it	developed	its	own	system	.
Kawasaki	Steel	Corp.	bought	a	Soviet	steel-casting	patent	two	years	ago	and	has	jointly	developed	the	system	with	the	Soviets	.
In	1991	,	the	Soviets	will	take	a	Japanese	journalist	*ICH*-1	into	space	,	the	first	Japanese	*	to	go	into	orbit	.
Soviet	efforts	*	to	sell	their	technology	abroad	do	n't	appear	*-1	to	worry	the	U.S.	,	Japan	's	principal	ally	.
``	We	have	never	opposed	the	development	of	economic	relations	between	our	allies	and	the	Soviet	Union	,	''	says	*T*-1	a	State	Department	official	.
``	Frankly	,	I	would	n't	expect	the	Japanese	to	get	hooked	on	anybody	's	technology	,	least	of	all	the	Soviets	.	''
Under	Mikhail	Gorbachev	's	perestroika	,	the	Soviets	have	sought	economic	ties	*ICH*-1	all	over	the	world	,	including	new	export	markets	.
They	believe	0	technology	is	one	of	their	best	bets	,	and	some	Soviet	officials	say	0	Moscow	will	even	consider	*-1	declassifying	military	know-how	if	the	price	is	right	.
The	Soviets	held	export	exhibitions	that	*T*-1	included	high-tech	items	in	New	York	and	West	Germany	.
Last	week	,	a	Soviet	delegation	came	to	Japan	*-1	to	push	more	space	technologies	.
Japan	is	a	major	target	for	the	Soviets	.
In	August	,	representatives	of	Keidanren	,	Japan	's	largest	business	organization	,	visited	Moscow	*-2	to	explore	exports	and	investments	that	*T*-1	would	help	the	Soviet	economy	.
Out	of	the	blue	,	the	Soviet	Chamber	of	Commerce	handed	over	details	on	59	technologies	that	the	Japanese	might	want	*-1	to	buy	.
These	mainly	involved	such	areas	as	materials	--	advanced	soldering	machines	,	for	example	--	and	medical	developments	derived	*	from	experimentation	in	space	,	such	as	artificial	blood	vessels	.
A	main	motive	is	hard	cash	.
But	,	while	the	Soviets	ca	n't	expect	direct	technology	flow	from	Japan	,	they	also	hope	*-1	to	benefit	from	Japanese	manufacturing	expertise	.
``	The	Soviet	Union	has	a	lot	of	know-how	,	but	it	*EXP*-1	has	been	difficult	*	to	put	that	into	actual	production	because	of	various	structural	problems	in	the	economy	,	''	says	*T*-2	Mr.	Shapovalov	,	the	Foreign	Ministry	official	.
The	Soviets	are	``	contemplating	a	flexible	system	under	which	it	*EXP*-2	would	be	possible	*	to	develop	-LCB-	technology	-RCB-	jointly	and	even	to	market	it	jointly	*T*-1	,	''	he	says	0	*T*-3	.
Even	if	the	Japanese	find	Soviet	technology	desirable	,	such	discussions	would	be	fraught	with	political	complications	.
*-1	Still	stinging	from	the	international	backlash	over	the	sale	two	years	ago	of	sensitive	military	technology	to	the	Soviets	by	a	subsidiary	of	Japan	's	Toshiba	Corp.	,	many	Japanese	are	eager	*-1	to	avoid	*-2	appearing	*-3	to	help	the	Soviets	in	any	way	.
Another	hurdle	concerns	Japan	's	attempts	*	to	persuade	the	Soviet	Union	*-1	to	relinquish	its	post-World	War	II	control	of	four	islands	north	of	Japan	.
So	far	,	the	Soviets	have	provided	only	the	sketchiest	information	about	their	technology	and	business	plans	.
And	what	they	have	shown	*T*-1	is	n't	impressive	.
``	My	impression	is	that	there	is	n't	anything	which	*T*-1	arouses	our	interest	at	first	glance	,	''	says	*T*-2	an	official	from	Japan	's	Ministry	of	International	Trade	and	Industry	.

-LRB-	During	its	centennial	year	,	The	Wall	Street	Journal	will	report	events	of	the	past	century	that	*T*-1	stand	as	milestones	of	American	business	history	.	-RRB-
MAY	1	,	1975	,	SIGNALED	A	DISTRESSFUL	May	Day	for	securities	houses	,	which	*T*-1	were	forced	*-2	to	end	183	years	of	*	charging	fixed	commissions	.
It	scared	brokers	,	but	most	survived	.
It	took	effect	after	seven	years	of	bitter	debate	between	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	and	traders	and	exchanges	.
Despite	warnings	*ICH*-1	from	such	leaders	as	former	Federal	Reserve	Board	Chairman	William	McChesney	Martin	that	unfixed	commissions	would	undo	the	industry	,	the	SEC	in	September	1973	said	0	full	competition	must	start	May	l	,	1975	.
The	timing	for	change	was	right	.
Institutions	had	become	active	market	players	in	the	early	1970s	and	sought	exchange	seats	*-1	to	handle	their	own	trades	.
And	the	industry	was	rife	with	brokers	trying	*-1	to	secure	big	client	orders	by	*-2	using	kickbacks	,	gifts	,	women	and	junkets	.
Within	three	weeks	of	the	1975	end	to	fixed	rates	there	were	all-out	price	wars	among	brokers	fighting	for	institutional	business	,	with	rate	slashes	of	35	%	to	60	%	*U*	below	pre-May	1	levels	.
Ray	Garrett	Jr.	,	SEC	chairman	,	said	0	the	``	breadth	and	depth	of	the	discounting	is	more	than	I	expected	*?*	.	''
Even	a	federal	measure	in	June	allowing	houses	to	add	research	fees	to	their	commissions	did	n't	stop	it	.
Longer	term	,	the	impact	is	unclear	.
The	change	prompted	the	rise	of	discount	brokers	and	a	reduction	in	securities	research	firms	.
But	there	are	currently	more	exchange	members	than	in	1975	,	with	the	bigger	houses	gaining	a	larger	share	of	total	commissions	.
Commissions	,	however	,	account	for	a	smaller	share	of	investment-house	business	as	takeover	advisory	fees	have	soared	.
Foreign	stock	markets	,	with	which	the	U.S.	is	entwined	*-2	,	also	have	ended	fixed	commissions	in	recent	years	.
It	came	in	London	's	``	Big	Bang	''	1986	deregulation	;	and	Toronto	's	``	Little	Bang	''	the	same	year	.
Paris	is	currently	phasing	out	fixed	commissions	under	its	``	Le	Petit	Bang	''	plan	.
President	Bush	said	that	three	members	of	his	cabinet	will	lead	a	presidential	mission	to	Poland	*-2	to	gauge	how	the	U.S.	can	help	the	new	non-Communist	government	's	economic	changes	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Bush	announced	several	weeks	ago	that	he	intended	*-1	to	send	such	a	mission	,	composed	*	of	top	government	aides	and	business	and	labor	leaders	.
The	mission	will	visit	Poland	from	Nov.	29	to	Dec.	2	,	the	White	House	said	0	*T*-1	.
In	remarks	at	a	White	House	ceremony	marking	Polish	Heritage	Month	,	Mr.	Bush	announced	that	Agriculture	Secretary	Clayton	Yeutter	,	Commerce	Secretary	Robert	Mosbacher	and	Labor	Secretary	Elizabeth	Dole	will	lead	the	U.S.	group	.
Michael	Boskin	,	chairman	of	the	Council	of	Economic	Advisers	,	also	will	be	a	member	.
In	addition	,	the	White	House	said	that	Charles	Harper	,	chairman	of	ConAgra	Inc.	,	and	John	McGillicuddy	,	chairman	of	Manufacturers	Hanover	Corp.	,	will	be	among	a	group	of	at	least	15	business	and	labor	representatives	in	the	presidential	mission	.
Mr.	Bush	said	0	the	group	is	*-2	to	``	focus	on	economic	sectors	where	U.S.	expertise	and	cooperation	can	indeed	make	a	difference	*T*-1	.	''
Mr.	Bush	has	asked	Congress	*-3	to	provide	more	than	$	400	million	*U*	in	economic	aid	and	food	grants	for	Poland	's	new	government	,	but	has	been	chided	*-1	by	Democrats	for	*-4	failing	*-2	to	do	more	.
Warner	Communications	Inc.	is	close	to	an	agreement	*	to	back	a	new	recorded	music	and	music	publishing	company	in	partnership	with	Irving	Azoff	,	who	*T*-1	resigned	in	September	as	head	of	MCA	Inc.	's	MCA	Records	unit	.
Warner	and	Mr.	Azoff	declined	comment	,	as	did	MCA	,	where	Mr.	Azoff	had	also	been	discussing	such	a	venture	*T*-1	*?*	.
But	record	industry	executives	familiar	with	the	talks	said	0	Mr.	Azoff	and	Warner	came	to	an	agreement	*ICH*-1	yesterday	*	to	form	a	50-50	joint-venture	company	funded	*	by	Warner	and	run	*	by	Mr.	Azoff	.
Among	other	things	,	they	said	0	*T*-1	,	Mr.	Azoff	would	develop	musical	acts	for	a	new	record	label	.
The	agreement	is	said	*-1	to	be	similar	to	Warner	's	50-50	partnership	with	record	and	movie	producer	David	Geffen	,	whose	films	and	records	*T*-2	are	distributed	*-51	by	the	Warner	Bros.	studio	and	the	Warner	records	unit	.
Although	Mr.	Azoff	wo	n't	produce	films	at	first	,	it	*EXP*-1	is	possible	that	he	could	do	so	later	,	the	sources	said	0	*T*-2	.
Like	Mr.	Geffen	's	arrangement	,	the	venture	gives	Mr.	Azoff	a	link	to	the	world	's	largest	and	most	successful	record	distributor	;	in	the	U.S.	alone	,	Warner	has	a	40	%	share	of	the	market	,	about	double	its	nearest	competitor	,	Sony	Corp.	's	CBS	Records	.
For	Warner	,	meanwhile	,	it	gives	the	company	a	second	young	partner	with	a	finger	on	the	pulse	of	the	hottest	trends	in	the	music	business	.
The	41-year-old	Mr.	Azoff	,	a	former	rock	'n'	roll	manager	,	is	credited	*-1	with	*-2	turning	around	MCA	's	once-moribund	music	division	in	his	six	years	at	the	company	.
But	Mr.	Azoff	had	been	negotiating	for	more	than	a	year	*-2	to	get	out	of	his	MCA	contract	,	which	*T*-1	expired	in	1991	.
Mr.	Azoff	reportedly	was	bored	and	frequently	clashed	with	top	MCA	management	over	a	number	of	issues	such	as	compensation	and	business	plans	.
Mr.	Azoff	also	was	eager	*-2	to	return	to	a	more	entrepreneurial	role	in	which	he	had	a	big	financial	stake	in	his	own	efforts	*T*-1	.
In	an	interview	at	the	time	of	his	resignation	from	MCA	,	he	said	:	``	I	'd	rather	build	a	company	than	run	one	.

Mr.	Panelli	has	plenty	of	company	.

The	Roper	Organization	,	which	*T*-1	conducted	the	survey	,	said	0	almost	half	of	the	exercise	equipment	owners	found	it	duller	than	they	expected	*?*	.

That	's	good	news	for	marketers	of	walking	shoes	.
The	survey	also	detected	a	bit	more	interest	in	golf	,	a	positive	sign	for	country	clubs	and	golf	club	makers	.
The	survey	's	findings	certainly	are	n't	encouraging	for	marketers	of	health-club	memberships	,	tennis	rackets	and	home	exercise	equipment	,	but	people	's	good	intentions	,	if	not	their	actions	,	are	keeping	sales	of	some	fitness	products	healthy	.
For	instance	,	sales	of	treadmills	,	exercise	bikes	,	stair	climbers	and	the	like	are	expected	*-2	to	rise	8	%	to	about	$	1.52	billion	*U*	this	year	,	according	to	the	National	Sporting	Goods	Association	,	which	*T*-1	sees	the	home	market	as	one	of	the	hottest	growth	areas	for	the	1990s	.
But	even	that	group	knows	0	some	people	do	n't	use	their	machines	as	much	as	they	should	*?*	.
``	The	first	excuse	is	0	they	do	n't	have	enough	time	,	''	says	*T*-1	research	director	Thomas	Doyle	.
``	The	second	is	0	they	do	n't	have	enough	discipline	.	''
With	more	than	15	million	exercise	bikes	sold	*	in	the	past	five	years	,	he	adds	0	*T*-1	,	``	a	lot	of	garages	,	basements	and	attics	must	be	populated	*-2	with	them	.	''
Still	,	the	average	price	of	such	bikes	rose	last	year	to	$	145	*U*	.
Mr.	Doyle	predicts	a	trend	toward	fewer	pieces	of	home	exercise	equipment	being	sold	*	at	higher	prices	.
Electronic	gimmicks	are	key	.
Premark	International	Inc.	,	for	example	,	peddles	the	M8.7sp	Electronic	Cycling	Simulator	,	a	$	2,000	*U*	stationary	cycle	.
On	a	video	screen	,	riders	can	see	30	different	``	rides	,	''	including	urban	,	mountain	and	desert	scenes	,	and	check	how	many	calories	*T*-2	are	burned	*-1	a	minute	.
Nancy	Igdaloff	,	who	*T*-1	works	in	corporate	payments	at	Bank	of	America	in	San	Francisco	,	may	be	a	good	prospect	for	such	a	gizmo	.
She	's	trying	*-2	to	sell	a	$	150	*U*	exercise	bike	0	she	bought	*T*-1	about	five	years	ago	for	her	roommate	.
But	rather	than	*-2	write	off	home	fitness	equipment	,	she	traded	up	:	Ms.	Igdaloff	just	paid	about	$	900	*U*	for	a	fancier	stationary	bike	,	with	a	timer	,	dials	showing	average	and	maximum	speeds	and	a	comfortable	seat	that	*T*-1	feels	almost	like	a	chair	.
``	I	'm	using	it	a	lot	,	''	she	says	*T*-1	.
``	I	spent	so	much	money	that	if	I	look	at	it	,	and	I	'm	not	on	it	,	I	feel	guilty	.	''
The	poll	points	up	some	inconsistencies	between	what	people	say	*T*-1	and	what	they	do	*T*-2	.
A	surprising	78	%	of	people	said	0	they	exercise	regularly	,	up	from	73	%	in	1981	.
This	conjures	up	images	of	a	nation	full	of	trim	,	muscular	folks	,	and	suggests	0	couch	potatoes	are	out	of	season	.
Of	course	,	that	is	n't	really	the	case	.
The	discrepancy	may	be	because	*	asking	people	about	their	fitness	regime	is	a	bit	like	*	inquiring	about	their	love	life	.
They	're	bound	*-1	to	exaggerate	.
``	People	say	0	they	swim	,	and	that	may	mean	0	they	've	been	to	the	beach	this	year	,	''	says	*T*-1	Krys	Spain	,	research	specialist	for	the	President	's	Council	on	Physical	Fitness	and	Sports	.
``	It	*EXP*-1	's	hard	*	to	know	if	people	are	responding	truthfully	.
People	are	too	embarrassed	*	to	say	0	they	have	n't	done	anything	.	''
While	she	applauds	the	fact	that	more	Americans	are	getting	up	from	the	television	*-2	to	stroll	or	garden	,	she	says	0	the	percentage	of	Americans	who	*T*-1	do	``	real	exercise	0	*T*-3	to	build	the	heart	''	is	only	10	%	to	20	%	*U*	.
So	many	people	*ICH*-2	fudge	on	answers	about	exercise	,	0	the	president	's	council	now	uses	specific	criteria	*-4	to	determine	what	*T*-1	is	considered	*-3	vigorous	:	It	must	produce	contractions	of	large	muscle	groups	,	must	achieve	60	%	of	maximum	aerobic	capacity	and	must	be	done	three	or	more	times	a	week	for	a	minimum	of	20	minutes	.
One	of	the	council	's	goals	,	set	*	in	1980	,	was	*	to	see	more	than	60	%	*U*	of	adults	under	65	years	of	age	getting	vigorous	exercise	by	1990	.
That	target	has	been	revised	*-1	to	30	%	by	the	year	2000	.
But	even	that	goal	may	prove	optimistic	.
Of	14	activities	,	the	Journal	survey	found	that	12	*T*-1	--	including	bicycling	,	skiing	and	swimming	--	are	being	done	*-4	by	fewer	Americans	*ICH*-2	today	than	eight	years	ago	.
Time	pressures	and	the	ebb	of	the	fitness	fad	are	cited	*-1	as	reasons	for	the	decline	.
Only	walking	and	golf	increased	in	popularity	during	the	1980s	--	and	only	slightly	.
Jeanette	Traverso	,	a	California	lawyer	,	gave	up	*	running	three	times	a	week	*-1	to	play	a	weekly	round	of	golf	,	*-1	finding	it	more	social	and	serene	.
It	's	an	activity	0	she	feels	0	she	can	do	*T*-1	for	life	,	and	by	*-2	pulling	a	golf	cart	,	she	still	gets	a	good	workout	.
``	I	'm	really	wiped	out	after	*-2	walking	five	hours	,	''	she	says	*T*-1	.
Most	people	said	0	they	exercise	both	for	health	and	enjoyment	.
``	If	you	sit	down	all	the	time	,	you	'll	go	stiff	,	''	says	*T*-2	Joyce	Hagood	,	a	Roxboro	,	N.C.	,	homemaker	who	*T*-1	walks	several	miles	a	week	.
``	And	it	's	relaxing	.
Sometimes	,	if	you	have	a	headache	,	you	can	go	out	and	walk	it	right	off	.	''
Only	about	a	quarter	of	the	respondents	said	0	they	exercise	*-1	to	lose	weight	.
Slightly	more	,	like	Leslie	Sherren	,	a	law	librarian	in	San	Francisco	who	*T*-1	attends	dance	aerobics	five	times	a	week	,	exercise	*-2	to	relieve	stress	.
``	*-2	Working	with	lawyers	,	''	she	says	*T*-1	,	``	I	need	it	.	''
But	fully	90	%	of	those	polled	*	felt	0	they	did	n't	need	*-1	to	belong	to	a	health	club	.
``	They	're	too	crowded	,	and	everybody	's	showing	off	,	''	says	*T*-1	Joel	Bryant	,	a	22-year-old	student	from	Pasadena	,	Calif	.
``	The	guys	are	being	macho	,	and	the	girls	are	walking	around	in	little	things	.
They	're	not	there	*-1	to	work	out	.	''
But	at	least	they	show	up	.
Nearly	half	of	those	who	*T*-1	joined	health	clubs	said	0	they	did	n't	use	their	membership	as	often	as	they	planned	*?*	.
*-1	Feeling	0	they	should	devote	more	time	to	their	families	or	their	jobs	,	many	yuppies	are	skipping	their	once-sacred	workout	.
Even	so	,	the	Association	of	Quality	Clubs	,	a	health-club	trade	group	in	Boston	,	says	0	membership	revenues	will	rise	about	5	%	this	year	from	last	year	's	$	5	billion	*U*	.
A	spokeswoman	adds	,	however	,	that	the	group	is	considering	*-2	offering	``	a	behavior-modification	course	,	similar	to	a	smoking-cessation	program	,	0	*T*-3	to	teach	people	ways	0	*	to	stay	with	it	*T*-1	.	''
There	are	die-hard	bodies	,	of	course	.
The	proprietor	of	Sante	West	,	an	aerobics	studio	in	San	Francisco	's	Marina	district	,	which	*T*-2	was	hit	*-1	hard	by	the	earthquake	,	says	,	``	People	were	going	nuts	the	minute	0	we	opened	*T*-4	,	''	three	days	after	the	quake	.
``	The	emotional	aspect	is	so	draining	,	0	they	needed	a	good	workout	.	''
Perhaps	the	most	disturbing	finding	is	that	the	bowling	alley	may	be	an	endangered	American	institution	.
The	survey	reported	0	the	number	of	people	who	*T*-1	said	0	they	bowl	regularly	has	fallen	to	just	8	%	from	17	%	in	1981	.
The	American	Bowling	Congress	claims	0	a	higher	percentage	of	the	public	bowls	regularly	,	but	concedes	0	its	membership	has	declined	this	decade	.
*-1	To	find	out	why	,	the	group	recently	commissioned	a	study	of	the	past	20	years	of	bowling-related	research	.
Three	reasons	*ICH*-4	were	pinpointed	*-5	:	a	preference	for	*	watching	bowling	and	other	sports	on	television	rather	than	actually	bowling	,	dowdy	bowling	centers	,	and	dissatisfaction	with	bowling	itself	.
People	who	*T*-1	start	*-3	bowling	*-3	expecting	it	to	be	a	pleasurable	exercise	``	have	been	generally	disappointed	,	''	the	report	said	*T*-2	.
But	not	Richard	Cottrell	,	a	San	Francisco	cab	driver	who	*T*-1	bowls	in	two	weekly	leagues	.
He	hit	the	lanes	three	years	ago	on	the	advice	of	his	doctor	.
``	It	's	good	exercise	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	I	ca	n't	do	anything	score-wise	,	but	I	like	meeting	the	girls	.	''
He	says	0	bowling	helps	him	shed	pounds	,	though	that	effort	is	sometimes	thwarted	*-2	by	the	fact	that	``	when	I	'm	drinking	*T*-1	,	I	bowl	better	.	''

Who	ya	gon	*-2	na	call	*T*-1	?
For	starters	,	some	people	call	Ed	and	Lorraine	Warren	.
When	it	comes	to	*	busting	ghosts	*T*-1	,	the	Monroe	,	Conn.	,	couple	are	perfect	demons	.
They	claim	*-1	to	have	busted	spirits	,	poltergeists	and	other	spooks	in	hundreds	of	houses	around	the	country	.
They	say	0	they	now	get	three	or	four	``	legitimate	''	calls	a	week	from	people	harried	*	by	haunts	.
``	I	firmly	believe	in	angels	,	devils	and	ghosts	,	''	says	*T*-2	Mr.	Warren	,	whose	business	card	*T*-1	identifies	him	as	a	``	demonologist	.	''
If	psychics	do	n't	work	,	but	your	house	still	seems	haunted	,	you	can	call	any	one	of	a	swelling	band	of	skeptics	such	as	Richard	Busch	.
*-1	A	professional	magician	and	musician	,	he	heads	the	Pittsburgh	branch	of	the	Committee	for	the	Scientific	Investigation	of	the	Paranormal	.
Mr.	Busch	says	0	there	is	a	scientific	explanation	for	all	haunts	,	and	he	can	even	tell	you	how	*	to	encourage	the	spirits	*T*-1	.
``	All	0	you	have	*-2	to	do	*T*-1	is	eat	a	big	pizza	,	and	then	go	to	bed	,	''	he	says	*T*-3	.
``	You	'll	have	weird	dreams	,	too	.	''
Either	way	,	the	ghostbusting	business	is	going	like	gangbusters	.
Tales	of	haunts	and	horrors	are	proliferating	beyond	the	nation	's	Elm	Streets	and	Amityvilles	.
``	I	get	calls	*ICH*-1	nearly	every	day	from	people	who	*T*-2	have	ghosts	in	their	house	,	''	says	*T*-3	Raymond	Hyman	,	a	skeptical	psychology	professor	at	the	University	of	Oregon	.
In	a	public	opinion	poll	published	*	in	the	October	issue	of	Parents	Magazine	,	a	third	of	those	queried	*	said	0	they	believe	that	ghosts	or	spirits	make	themselves	known	to	people	.
``	The	movies	,	the	books	,	the	tabloids	--	even	Nancy	Reagan	is	boosting	this	stuff	,	''	says	*T*-2	Paul	Kurtz	,	a	philosophy	professor	at	the	State	University	of	New	York	at	Buffalo	,	who	*T*-1	heads	the	Committee	for	the	Scientific	Investigation	of	the	Paranormal	.
The	committee	,	formed	*	in	1967	,	now	has	60	chapters	around	the	world	.
The	spirits	,	of	course	,	could	hardly	care	less	whether	people	do	*RNR*-1	or	do	n't	*RNR*-1	believe	in	them	.
They	do	n't	even	give	a	nod	to	human	sensibilities	by	*-1	celebrating	Halloween	.
For	the	spooks	it	's	just	another	day	of	ectoplasmic	business	as	usual	,	ghostbusters	say	0	*T*-1	;	the	holiday	seems	*-2	to	occasion	no	unusual	number	of	ghost	reports	.
One	of	the	busiest	ghostbusters	is	Robert	Baker	,	a	68-year-old	semi-retired	University	of	Kentucky	psychology	professor	whose	bushy	gray	eyebrows	*T*-1	arch	at	the	mere	mention	of	a	ghost	.
Mr.	Baker	says	0	he	has	personally	bested	more	than	50	haunts	,	from	aliens	to	poltergeists	.
Mr.	Baker	heads	the	Kentucky	Association	of	Science	Educators	and	Skeptics	.
Like	Hollywood	's	Ghostbusters	,	Kentucky	's	stand	*-2	ready	*-3	to	roll	when	haunts	get	out	of	hand	*T*-1	.
But	they	do	n't	careen	around	in	an	old	Cadillac	,	wear	funny	suits	or	blast	away	at	slimy	spirits	.
Mr.	Baker	drives	a	1987	Chevy	and	usually	wears	a	tweed	jacket	on	his	ghostbusting	forays	.
``	I	've	never	met	a	ghost	that	*T*-1	could	n't	be	explained	away	*-3	by	perfectly	natural	means	,	''	he	says	*T*-2	.
When	a	Louisville	woman	complained	that	a	ghost	was	haunting	her	attic	*T*-1	,	Mr.	Baker	discovered	a	rat	dragging	a	trap	across	the	rafters	.
A	foul-smelling	demon	supposedly	plagued	a	house	in	Mannington	,	Ky	.
Mr.	Baker	found	an	opening	under	the	house	that	*T*-1	led	to	a	fume-filled	coal	mine	.
When	the	weather	cools	*T*-1	,	Mr.	Baker	says	0	*T*-2	,	hobos	often	hole	up	in	abandoned	houses	.
``	People	see	activity	in	there	,	and	the	next	thing	0	you	know	*T*-1	,	you	've	got	a	haunting	,	''	he	says	*T*-2	.
On	a	recent	afternoon	,	Mr.	Baker	and	a	reporter	go	*-2	ghost-busting	,	*-3	visiting	Kathleen	Stinnett	,	a	Lexington	woman	who	*T*-1	has	phoned	the	University	of	Kentucky	*-4	to	report	mysterious	happenings	in	her	house	.
Mrs.	Stinnett	says	0	she	never	believed	in	ghosts	before	,	but	lately	her	vacuum	cleaner	turned	itself	on	,	a	telephone	flew	off	its	stand	,	doors	slammed	inexplicably	,	and	she	heard	footsteps	in	her	empty	kitchen	.
``	I	was	doing	the	laundry	and	nearly	broke	my	neck	*-3	running	upstairs	*-4	to	see	who	*T*-1	was	there	,	and	it	was	nobody	,	''	she	says	*T*-2	,	eyes	wide	at	the	recollection	.
Mr.	Baker	hears	her	out	,	pokes	around	a	bit	,	asks	a	few	questions	and	proposes	some	explanations	.
Of	the	self-starting	vacuum	cleaner	,	he	says	:	``	*	Could	be	Cuddles	,	-LCB-	Mrs.	Stinnett	's	dog	-RCB-	.	''
The	flying	telephone	:	``	You	tangle	the	base	cord	around	a	chair	leg	,	and	the	receiver	does	seem	*-1	to	fly	off	.	''
The	ghostly	footsteps	:	``	Interstate	64	is	a	block	away	,	and	heavy	traffic	can	sure	set	a	house	to	*-1	vibrating	.	''
``	I	'm	not	sure	0	he	's	explained	everything	,	''	Mrs.	Stinnett	says	*T*-1	grudgingly	.
``	There	are	some	things	that	*T*-1	have	gone	on	here	that	nobody	can	explain	*T*-3	,	''	she	says	*T*-2	.
Mr.	Baker	promises	*-1	to	return	if	the	haunting	continues	.
For	especially	stubborn	haunts	,	Mr.	Baker	carries	a	secret	weapon	,	a	vial	of	cornstarch	.
``	I	tell	people	0	it	's	the	groundup	bones	of	saints	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	I	sprinkle	a	little	around	and	tell	the	demons	*-1	to	leave	.
It	's	reassuring	,	and	it	usually	works	.	''
Oregon	's	Mr.	Hyman	has	investigated	claims	of	flying	cats	,	apparitions	and	bouncing	chandeliers	and	has	come	up	with	a	plausible	explanation	,	he	says	,	for	every	one	.
``	Invariably	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	,	``	eyewitnesses	are	untrustworthy	.	''
Two	years	ago	,	a	Canadian	reader	bet	Omni	Magazine	$	1,000	*U*	that	it	could	n't	debunk	the	uncanny	goings-on	in	``	the	Oregon	Vortex	,	''	a	former	Indian	burial	ground	in	southern	Oregon	.
To	viewers	from	a	distance	,	visitors	to	the	spot	seemed	*-1	to	shrink	disproportionately	,	relative	to	the	background	.
The	magazine	called	in	Mr.	Hyman	as	a	consultant	.
He	showed	up	with	a	carpenter	's	level	,	carefully	measured	every	surface	and	showed	how	the	apparent	shrinkage	was	caused	*-1	by	the	perspective	*T*-2	.
``	A	very	striking	illusion	,	''	Mr.	Hyman	says	*-1	now	,	his	voice	dripping	with	skepticism	,	``	but	an	illusion	nevertheless	.	''
The	Canadian	wound	up	*-1	writing	a	check	.
The	Rev.	Alphonsus	Trabold	,	a	theology	professor	and	exorcism	expert	at	St.	Bonaventure	University	in	Olean	,	N.Y.	,	frequently	is	asked	*-1	*-2	to	exorcise	unruly	spirits	,	and	he	often	obliges	.
``	On	certain	occasions	a	spirit	could	be	earthbound	and	make	itself	known	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	It	happens	.	''
Father	Trabold	often	uses	what	he	calls	*T*-1	``	a	therapeutic	exorcism	''	:	a	few	prayers	and	an	admonition	*ICH*-2	to	the	spirit	*	to	leave	.
``	If	the	person	believes	0	there	's	an	evil	spirit	,	you	ask	it	*-3	to	be	gone	*-1	,	''	he	says	*T*-2	.
``	The	suggestion	itself	may	do	the	healing	.	''
But	sometimes	more	energetic	attacks	are	required	*-1	.
*-2	To	wrestle	with	a	demon	in	a	house	owned	*	by	a	Litchfield	,	Conn.	,	woman	,	the	Warrens	recently	called	in	an	exorcist	,	the	Rev.	Robert	McKenna	,	a	dissident	clergyman	who	*T*-1	hews	to	the	Catholic	Church	's	old	Latin	liturgy	.
I	attend	,	and	so	does	*T*-1	a	television	crew	from	New	York	City	.
Mr.	Warren	pronounces	the	Litchfield	case	``	your	typical	demonic	infestation	.	''
A	Scottish	dwarf	built	the	small	red	house	110	years	ago	and	now	his	demonic	ghost	haunts	it	,	Mr.	Warren	says	0	*T*-1	.
The	owner	,	who	*T*-1	begs	anonymity	,	asserts	that	the	dwarf	,	*-2	appearing	as	a	dark	shadow	,	has	manhandled	her	,	*-2	tossing	her	around	the	living	room	and	yanking	out	a	hank	of	hair	.
Two	previous	exorcisms	have	failed	.
``	This	is	a	very	tenacious	ghost	,	''	Mr.	Warren	says	*T*-1	darkly	.
Father	McKenna	moves	through	the	house	*-1	praying	in	Latin	,	urging	the	demon	*-2	to	split	.
Suddenly	the	woman	begins	swaying	and	then	writhing	.
``	She	's	being	attacked	*-1	by	the	demon	,	''	Mrs.	Warren	stagewhispers	*T*-2	as	the	priest	sprinkles	holy	water	over	the	squirming	woman	,	and	the	television	camera	grinds	.
A	half-hour	later	,	the	woman	is	smiling	and	chatting	;	the	demon	seems	*-1	to	have	gone	.

THE	IRS	may	taketh	what	the	Labor	Department	giveth	*T*-1	.
But	*	stay	tuned	.
Employee-benefit	specialists	drew	a	collective	sigh	of	relief	in	early	October	when	the	Labor	Department	backed	away	from	a	proposal	that	companies	let	former	employees	and	beneficiaries	--	along	with	active	workers	--	borrow	against	balances	in	401	-LRB-	k	-RRB-	and	similar	savings	plans	*T*-1	.

Now	comes	word	that	IRS	regulations	being	drafted	*	could	put	companies	in	violation	of	the	tax	code	if	they	make	loans	to	retiree	shareholders	and	directors	but	do	n't	make	them	available	to	other	former	workers	who	*T*-1	usually	earned	less	.
The	IRS	says	0	the	question	wo	n't	be	settled	*-1	until	the	regulations	are	issued	*-2	``	shortly	.	''

Is	somebody	telling	us	something	?
Our	copy	of	Racine	-LRB-	Wis	.	-RRB-	Labor	comes	through	the	mail	*-1	wrapped	around	two	sections	of	Baseball	Card	News	.
Democracy	is	making	a	return	with	a	vengeance	to	Latin	America	's	most	populous	and	deeply	indebted	country	.
On	Nov.	15	,	when	Brazilians	elect	a	president	for	the	first	time	in	29	years	*T*-1	,	the	country	's	82	million	voters	will	have	22	candidates	0	*	to	choose	from	*T*-2	.
The	candidates	have	been	crisscrossing	this	huge	country	of	145	million	people	,	*-3	holding	rallies	and	televised	debates	in	hope	of	*-4	being	elected	*-1	to	what	*T*-2	must	be	one	of	the	world	's	most	thankless	political	jobs	:	*	trying	*-5	to	drag	Brazil	out	of	its	economic	and	social	mess	.
``	I	feel	sorry	for	whoever	*T*-1	wins	,	''	says	*T*-2	a	Brazilian	diplomat	.
Who	that	winner	will	be	*T*-1	is	highly	uncertain	.
A	half-dozen	candidates	,	*-2	backing	policies	ranging	from	Thatcherism	to	watered-down	Marxism	,	are	given	*-2	a	chance	of	*	winning	.
``	Whoever	*T*-1	says	0	he	knows	which	of	the	six	*T*-2	will	win	is	out	of	his	mind	,	''	says	*T*-3	Antonio	Britto	,	a	centrist	member	of	Parliament	.
The	favorite	remains	Fernando	Collor	de	Mello	,	a	40-year-old	former	governor	of	the	state	of	Alagoas	.
He	came	out	of	nowhere	*-2	to	grab	the	lead	in	opinion	polls	,	probably	less	*ICH*-3	because	of	his	vague	program	0	*T*-1	to	``	build	a	new	Brazil	''	than	because	of	his	good	looks	,	the	open	backing	of	the	powerful	Rede	Globo	television	network	and	his	reputation	as	a	hunter	of	``	maharajahs	,	''	or	overpaid	and	underworked	civil	servants	.
But	after	*-1	building	up	a	commanding	lead	,	the	moderate	to	conservative	Mr.	Collor	has	slipped	to	about	30	%	in	the	polls	from	a	high	of	about	43	%	only	a	few	weeks	ago	.
*	To	avoid	a	runoff	,	one	candidate	would	have	*-2	to	win	50	%	of	the	vote	--	a	feat	that	most	analysts	consider	*T*-1	impossible	with	so	many	candidates	running	.
Two	left-wing	politicians	,	Socialist	Leonel	Brizola	,	a	former	governor	of	Rio	de	Janeiro	state	,	and	Marxist-leaning	Luis	Inacio	da	Silva	,	currently	are	running	neck	and	neck	at	about	15	%	,	and	three	other	candidates	are	given	*-1	a	chance	of	*	reaching	the	Dec.	17	runoff	election	between	the	two	biggest	vote-getters	:	Social	Democrat	Mario	Covas	and	two	conservatives	,	Paulo	Salim	Maluf	,	a	former	governor	of	the	state	of	Sao	Paulo	,	and	Guilherme	Afif	Domingos	.
The	uncertainty	is	sending	shivers	through	Brazilian	financial	markets	.
The	dollar	,	the	best	indicator	of	the	country	's	mood	,	has	skyrocketed	on	the	parallel	market	,	as	has	gold	*?*	.
Capital	flight	is	reported	*-1	to	be	strong	.
The	big	question	is	whether	the	new	president	will	have	the	strength	and	the	political	support	in	Congress	0	*	to	take	steps	*-2	to	cure	Brazil	's	economic	ills	*T*-1	.
President	Jose	Sarney	,	who	*T*-1	took	office	in	1985	when	the	man	picked	*	by	an	electoral	college	became	critically	ill	*T*-2	,	appears	*-3	to	be	simply	trying	*-4	to	avoid	hyperinflation	.
The	unpopular	Mr.	Sarney	,	whose	task	*T*-1	was	*	to	bring	about	a	smooth	transition	to	democracy	after	21	years	of	military	rule	,	is	n't	seeking	re-election	.
What	*T*-1	comes	out	of	the	ballot	box	could	be	crucial	in	*	determining	whether	Brazil	finally	lives	up	to	the	potential	of	the	world	's	eighth	largest	economy	or	keeps	*-2	living	up	to	its	other	,	less	enviable	title	:	that	of	the	developing	world	's	largest	debtor	,	teetering	on	the	brink	of	hyperinflation	,	mired	in	deficits	and	stagnation	,	with	huge	economic	inequalities	and	social	discontent	boiling	under	the	surface	.
If	Brazil	devises	an	economic	strategy	allowing	it	to	resume	growth	and	service	debt	,	this	could	lead	it	to	open	up	*RNR*-1	and	deregulate	*RNR*-1	its	sheltered	economy	,	analysts	say	*T*-3	,	just	as	Argentinian	President	Carlos	Saul	Menem	has	been	doing	even	though	he	was	elected	*-2	on	a	populist	platform	.
``	Depending	on	the	president	,	we	could	either	be	a	trillion-dollar	economy	by	the	end	of	the	century	or	stay	where	we	are	*T*-1	,	''	says	*T*-2	political	scientist	Amaury	de	Souza	.
``	And	where	we	are	*T*-1	is	bad	.	''
Despite	valiant	efforts	by	Finance	Minister	Mailson	Ferreira	da	Nobrega	,	inflation	came	to	36	%	in	September	alone	and	is	expected	*-1	to	top	1,000	%	for	the	year	.
That	might	have	been	considered	*-1	hyperinflation	not	long	ago	,	but	Argentina	endured	price	increases	of	almost	200	%	in	July	before	*-2	bringing	the	rate	down	sharply	in	August	and	September	.
Still	,	massive	internal	debt	has	forced	the	government	to	borrow	massively	on	the	domestic	market	and	to	offer	inflation-adjusted	returns	of	2	%	to	3	%	*U*	a	month	just	*-1	to	get	investors	to	hold	on	to	its	paper	.
About	$	70	billion	*U*	is	estimated	*-2	to	be	tied	up	in	the	short-term	money	market	,	which	*T*-1	acts	both	as	a	hedge	against	inflation	for	consumers	and	an	accelerator	of	inflation	and	deficits	for	the	government	.
By	some	estimates	,	Brazil	's	internal	debt	,	or	combined	public	deficit	,	could	reach	6.5	%	of	its	$	351	billion	*U*	gross	domestic	product	.
Much	of	the	money	goes	into	subsidies	or	*	keeping	inefficient	state-controlled	companies	operating	.
Among	the	results	is	*T*-1	a	frequent	breakdown	of	public	services	.
It	*EXP*-1	's	not	uncommon	*	to	wait	three	minutes	for	a	dial	tone	after	*-3	picking	up	the	telephone	,	and	then	to	be	interrupted	*-3	by	a	busy	signal	before	*-3	finishing	dialing	the	number	.
Officials	also	say	0	a	national	electricity	shortage	might	not	be	far	off	.
Economists	,	businessmen	and	some	politicians	agree	that	the	answer	is	an	orthodox	economic	austerity	program	including	reduced	state	spending	;	*	focusing	spending	on	vital	areas	such	as	education	,	health	and	welfare	;	*	turning	state	companies	private	;	*	reforming	the	tax	system	,	*	raising	public	service	rates	*	to	match	costs	;	and	possibly	a	temporary	wage	and	price	freeze	and	a	devaluation	of	the	cruzado	.
Analysts	also	say	0	it	*EXP*-2	's	inevitable	that	Brazil	will	seek	*-3	to	renegotiate	its	$	115	billion	*U*	foreign	debt	,	on	which	it	suspended	interest	payments	*T*-1	last	month	.
Analysts	say	,	however	,	that	a	tough	economic	program	would	have	*-2	to	be	accompanied	*-1	by	measures	0	*T*-3	to	shield	the	poor	from	its	recessionary	effects	,	for	instance	by	*	subsidizing	staple	food	items	.
About	80	%	of	Brazil	's	voters	are	believed	*-1	to	live	near	the	poverty	level	.
Of	the	three	candidates	with	a	serious	chance	of	*	winning	,	Mr.	Collor	comes	closest	to	*	advocating	the	sort	of	measures	that	economists	say	0	*T*-1	are	necessary	.
But	his	inexperience	raises	doubts	that	he	would	have	the	political	power	*	to	carry	them	out	.
The	67-year-old	Mr.	Brizola	has	been	vague	about	his	intentions	and	often	inflammatory	in	his	rhetoric	,	but	analysts	say	0	he	probably	would	be	pragmatic	.
Mr.	da	Silva	,	a	43-year-old	former	factory	worker	and	labor	leader	,	is	the	most	radical	,	*-1	vowing	*-2	to	withhold	payments	on	the	foreign	debt	and	saying	0	he	``	would	n't	go	around	*-3	putting	the	country	up	for	sale	to	the	highest	bidder	.	''
But	despite	the	differences	in	what	they	say	*T*-1	,	according	to	some	analysts	here	,	economic	constraints	mean	0	the	next	president	may	not	have	many	choices	about	what	he	does	*T*-2	.
Hospital	Regulation	Sparks	Kentucky	Feud
WHICH	*T*-1	IS	the	best	medicine	for	runaway	health	costs	:	competition	or	regulation	?
The	question	is	at	the	root	of	a	brawl	between	Humana	Inc.	,	the	big	for-profit	hospital	and	insurance	company	,	and	its	not-for-profit	brethren	in	its	home	state	of	Kentucky	.
The	battle	focuses	on	the	state	's	certificate-of-need	law	,	which	*T*-1	regulates	investment	in	new	medical	technology	.
The	law	has	prevented	$	216	million	*U*	of	unnecessary	expenditures	since	1986	,	according	to	William	S.	Conn	,	president	of	the	Kentucky	Hospital	Association	.
But	according	to	David	Jones	,	Humana	's	chief	executive	,	it	promotes	technology	monopolies	,	stifles	innovation	and	raises	prices	.
If	the	Legislature	does	n't	repeal	the	law	,	due	for	revision	in	1990	,	Mr.	Jones	says	0	Humana	may	move	its	insurance	operations	,	including	3,000	jobs	in	Louisville	,	to	another	state	.
The	company	complains	that	it	paid	$	10	million	*U*	to	non-Humana	hospitals	in	its	latest	fiscal	year	for	services	provided	*	to	its	insurance	plan	members	.
But	Humana	says	0	its	own	facilities	could	serve	its	insured	for	less	if	they	were	properly	equipped	.
Mr.	Conn	charges	that	Humana	's	own	actions	undermine	its	argument	.
When	a	hospital	in	Lexington	installed	a	lithotripter	last	year	*T*-1	,	demand	for	a	similar	kidney-stone	smashing	machine	at	a	Humana	hospital	in	Louisville	fell	34	%	.
The	Humana	hospital	responded	by	*-3	jacking	up	prices	*-4	to	make	up	for	lost	revenue	,	Mr.	Conn	says	0	*T*-2	,	and	now	charges	as	much	as	$	8,000	*U*	for	the	procedure	,	which	*T*-1	costs	only	about	$	3,500	*U*	in	Lexington	.
Humana	contends	that	$	8,000	*U*	represents	an	extreme	case	and	that	its	regular	charge	for	lithotripsy	is	$	4,900	*U*	.
Meanwhile	,	another	hospital	's	proposal	for	a	new-generation	lithotripter	is	pending	before	the	board	that	*T*-1	administers	the	certificate-of-need	law	.
Humana	,	which	*T*-1	wants	*-3	to	acquire	one	of	the	new	machines	itself	,	is	on	the	record	as	opposed	to	the	proposal	.
Debt-Burdened	Doctors	Seek	Financial	Security
HEALTH-CARE	experts	have	long	worried	that	young	doctors	emerging	from	medical	school	with	a	mountain	of	debt	will	choose	careers	in	high-paying	specialties	instead	of	primary	care	,	where	more	physicians	are	needed	*-1	most	*T*-2	.
Now	there	's	a	new	wrinkle	*ICH*-2	in	what	young	doctors	want	*T*-1	:	More	than	half	of	300	residents	responding	to	recent	survey	said	0	they	'd	prefer	a	guaranteed	salary	over	traditional	fee-for-service	compensation	in	their	first	professional	position	.
And	81	%	preferred	a	group	practice	or	health	maintenance	organization	,	while	just	11	%	favored	solo	practice	.
``	Ten	years	ago	,	a	physician	would	go	to	a	town	and	take	out	a	loan	-LRB-	*-3	to	start	a	practice	-RRB-	,	''	says	*T*-2	James	Merritt	,	president	of	Merritt	,	Hawkins	&	Associates	,	an	Irvine	,	Calif.	,	physician	recruiter	that	*T*-1	conducted	the	survey	.
``	They	wo	n't	do	that	very	often	today	at	all	.
They	're	looking	for	something	that	*T*-1	's	very	safe	.	''
The	numbers	behind	such	fears	:	The	average	debt	of	medical	school	graduates	who	*T*-3	borrowed	*-2	to	pay	for	their	education	jumped	10	%	to	$	42,374	*U*	this	year	from	$	38,489	*U*	in	1988	,	says	0	*T*-1	the	Association	of	American	Medical	Colleges	.
That	's	115	%	more	than	in	1981	.
Money	is	n't	the	only	reason	for	the	shift	in	practice	preferences	.
It	reflects	values	of	a	generation	that	*T*-1	wants	more	time	for	families	and	personal	interests	,	says	*T*-3	John	H.	Moxley	III	,	who	*T*-2	directs	physician-executive	searches	for	Korn\/Ferry	International	.
``	This	is	a	change	in	the	social	fabric	of	medicine	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
Related	Roommates	Trim	Hospital	Bills
WHEN	Catherine	Bobar	spent	several	weeks	at	the	Medical	Center	of	Vermont	recently	with	a	bone	infection	in	her	toe	*T*-1	,	she	shared	a	room	just	like	most	patients	.
But	unlike	most	patients	,	her	roommate	was	her	husband	.
``	It	*EXP*-3	was	certainly	good	*	to	have	him	handy	,	''	Mrs.	Bobar	says	*T*-1	.
The	12-bed	``	cooperative	care	''	unit	is	one	of	about	18	nationwide	where	a	family	member	or	friend	helps	care	for	a	patient	in	the	hospital	*T*-1	.
``	The	philosophy	is	*	to	make	the	patient	and	the	family	very	responsible	for	a	portion	of	their	own	care	,	''	says	*T*-1	Anthony	J.	Grieco	,	medical	director	of	cooperative	care	at	New	York	University	Medical	Center	,	where	the	concept	began	10	years	ago	*T*-2	.
``	It	helps	us	,	and	them	,	while	they	're	here	,	and	it	certainly	makes	them	a	better	health-care	team	when	they	get	home	*T*-1	.	''
It	also	saves	money	.
Because	patients	require	less	attention	from	nurses	and	other	staff	,	room	charges	are	lower	--	about	$	100	*U*	less	per	day	than	a	regular	room	at	the	Vermont	hospital	.
Cancer	patients	needing	prolonged	radiation	therapy	,	diabetics	learning	*	to	manage	their	blood	sugar	levels	,	and	cardiac	bypass	patients	are	among	those	who	*T*-1	spend	time	on	cooperative-care	units	.

``	It	's	really	part	of	the	hospital	of	the	21st	century	,	''	Dr.	Grieco	says	*T*-1	.

THE	CHIEF	NURSING	officer	can	be	responsible	for	more	than	1,000	employees	and	at	least	one-third	of	a	hospital	's	budget	;	a	head	nurse	typically	oversees	up	to	80	employees	and	$	8	million	*U*	.

Meharry	Medical	College	in	Nashville	,	Tenn.	,	launches	a	new	research	publication	*ICH*-1	in	the	spring	:	the	Journal	on	Health	Care	for	the	Poor	and	Underserved	.
A	group	of	Michigan	investors	has	offered	*-2	to	buy	Knight-Ridder	Inc.	's	ailing	Detroit	Free	Press	for	$	68	million	*U*	but	has	left	unclear	how	the	offer	will	be	financed	*-1	*T*-3	.
The	offer	came	just	prior	to	arguments	before	the	U.S.	Supreme	Court	over	whether	the	Free	Press	should	be	allowed	*-1	to	enter	into	a	joint	operating	pact	with	Gannett	Co.	's	Detroit	News	.
The	group	led	*	by	Birmingham	,	Mich.	,	publicist	William	D.	McMaster	did	n't	name	an	investment	banker	backing	the	deal	or	say	how	much	its	members	will	contribute	*T*-1	to	the	offer	.
Indeed	,	some	individuals	identified	*	with	the	group	said	0	they	have	n't	committed	any	money	to	the	bid	and	were	n't	aware	of	it	until	they	heard	about	it	in	local	news	accounts	over	the	weekend	.
Knight-Ridder	would	n't	comment	on	the	offer	.
The	company	has	said	0	the	paper	is	n't	for	sale	,	and	has	rebuffed	Mr.	McMaster	's	earlier	requests	for	access	to	Free	Press	financial	statements	.
In	his	letter	to	Knight-Ridder	President	James	K.	Batten	,	Mr.	McMaster	said	0	he	arrived	at	the	$	68	million	*U*	figure	*-1	using	Knight-Ridder	's	corporate	financial	statements	and	comments	by	Knight-Ridder	officials	that	the	Free	Press	has	a	$	50	million	*U*	value	in	salvage	.
But	in	an	interview	,	Mr.	McMaster	said	0	he	and	his	investment	banker	would	need	access	to	full	financial	records	before	*-1	firming	up	the	offer	.

NRM	Energy	Co.	said	0	it	filed	materials	with	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	*	calling	for	it	to	restructure	into	a	corporation	from	a	limited	partnership	.
The	partnership	said	0	it	is	proposing	the	change	largely	because	the	provisions	of	its	senior	notes	restrict	it	from	*-1	making	distributions	on	its	units	outstanding	.
NRM	suspended	its	common	distribution	in	June	1988	and	the	distribution	on	its	$	2	*U*	cumulative	convertible	acquisition	preferred	units	in	September	.
However	,	unpaid	distributions	on	the	acquisition	preferred	*	are	cumulative	and	would	total	$	23	million	*U*	a	year	,	*	hurting	NRM	's	financial	flexibility	and	its	ability	*	to	raise	capital	,	NRM	said	0	*T*-1	.
In	*	following	several	other	oil	and	gas	partnerships	that	*T*-1	have	made	the	conversion	to	a	corporation	in	the	last	year	,	NRM	also	noted	that	tax	advantages	for	partnerships	have	diminished	under	new	tax	laws	and	said	0	it	would	save	$	2	million	*U*	a	year	in	administrative	costs	from	the	change	.
Under	the	plan	,	NRM	said	0	holders	of	its	common	units	will	receive	one	share	of	new	common	stock	in	Edisto	Resources	Corp.	for	every	14.97	common	units	owned	*	.
Holders	of	NRM	's	$	2	*U*	cumulative	convertible	acquisition	preferred	units	will	receive	one	new	common	share	in	Edisto	for	every	1.342	units	0	they	own	*T*-1	.
After	the	transaction	,	current	common	unitholders	will	own	about	21.3	%	of	Edisto	,	current	acquisition	preferred	holders	will	own	72.3	%	,	and	current	stockholders	of	Edisto	will	own	about	6.4	%	,	about	the	same	stake	as	Edisto	owns	*?*	now	in	NRM	.
Edisto	currently	is	the	general	partner	of	NRM	.
As	the	largest	holder	of	acquisition	preferred	units	,	Mesa	Limited	Partnership	would	own	about	28	%	of	Edisto	after	the	transaction	.
As	part	of	the	transaction	,	Edisto	agreed	*-1	to	give	Mesa	,	an	Amarillo	,	Texas	,	oil	and	gas	partnership	managed	*	by	T.	Boone	Pickens	Jr.	,	a	seat	on	its	board	.
NRM	said	0	its	$	2.60	*U*	senior	cumulative	convertible	preferred	units	will	be	converted	*-1	into	an	equal	number	of	shares	of	$	2.60	*U*	senior	cumulative	convertible	preferred	stock	of	Edisto	.
The	transaction	is	subject	to	approval	of	NRM	unitholders	of	record	on	Oct.	23	,	among	other	conditions	.
NRM	said	0	it	expects	unitholders	to	vote	on	the	restructuring	at	a	meeting	Dec.	15	.
Sherwin-Williams	Co.	and	Whittaker	Corp.	said	0	they	've	discontinued	talks	toward	a	definitive	agreement	regarding	Sherwin-Williams	'	acquisition	of	Whittaker	's	chemical	coating	group	.
The	companies	reached	an	agreement	in	principle	for	the	sale	in	August	.
Terms	were	n't	disclosed	*-1	.
Cleveland-based	Sherwin-Williams	produces	paints	and	coatings	,	while	the	Los	Angeles-based	Whittaker	coatings	group	produces	industrial	coatings	.
USG	Corp.	agreed	*-1	to	sell	its	headquarters	building	here	to	Manufacturers	Life	Insurance	Co.	of	Toronto	,	and	will	lease	the	19-story	facility	until	it	moves	to	a	new	quarters	in	1992	.
The	building-materials	concern	did	n't	disclose	terms	of	the	sale	,	which	*T*-1	will	close	in	the	first	quarter	of	next	year	.
Proceeds	from	the	planned	sale	of	the	250,000-square-foot	building	``	will	help	*-2	reduce	the	debt	incurred	*	as	a	result	of	our	July	1988	recapitalization	,	''	said	*T*-1	a	USG	official	.
The	recently	revived	enthusiasm	among	small	investors	for	stock	mutual	funds	has	been	damped	*-1	by	a	jittery	stock	market	and	the	tumult	over	program	trading	.
After	*-1	hitting	two-year	highs	this	summer	,	net	sales	of	stock	funds	slowed	in	September	,	according	to	the	Investment	Company	Institute	,	a	trade	group	.
The	sales	recovery	screeched	to	a	halt	this	month	,	some	analysts	say	0	*T*-1	.
``	Confidence	was	starting	*-2	to	come	back	because	we	did	n't	have	wildly	volatile	days	,	''	says	*T*-1	Tyler	Jenks	,	research	director	for	Kanon	Bloch	Carre	&	Co.	,	a	Boston	research	firm	.
``	Now	everything	''	--	such	as	program	trading	and	wide	stock	market	swings	--	``	that	everyone	had	pushed	back	in	their	consciousness	is	just	sitting	right	there	.	''
Net	sales	of	stock	funds	in	September	totaled	$	839.4	million	*U*	,	down	from	$	1.1	billion	*U*	in	August	,	the	institute	said	0	*T*-1	.
But	if	reinvested	dividends	are	excluded	*-1	,	investors	put	in	only	$	340	million	*U*	more	than	they	pulled	out	for	the	month	.
October	's	numbers	,	which	*T*-3	wo	n't	be	released	*-1	for	a	month	,	are	down	further	,	mutual	fund	executives	say	0	*T*-2	.
Investors	in	stock	funds	did	n't	panic	the	weekend	after	mid-October	's	190-point	market	plunge	.
Most	of	the	those	who	*T*-1	left	stock	funds	simply	switched	into	money	market	funds	.
And	some	fund	groups	said	0	investors	actually	became	net	buyers	.
But	the	stock	market	swings	have	continued	.
The	recent	outcry	over	program	trading	will	cast	a	pall	over	the	stock-fund	environment	in	the	coming	months	,	some	analysts	say	0	*T*-1	.
``	The	public	is	very	close	to	*	having	had	it	,	''	Mr.	Jenks	says	*T*-1	.
Investors	pulled	back	from	bond	funds	in	September	,	too	.
Net	sales	of	bond	funds	for	the	month	totaled	$	1.1	billion	*U*	,	down	two-thirds	from	$	3.1	billion	*U*	in	August	.
The	major	reason	:	heavy	outflows	from	high-risk	,	high-yield	junk	bond	funds	.
Big	withdrawals	from	the	junk	funds	have	continued	this	month	.
Overall	,	net	sales	of	all	mutual	funds	,	excluding	money	market	funds	,	fell	to	$	1.9	billion	*U*	in	September	from	$	4.2	billion	*U*	in	August	,	the	trade	group	said	0	*T*-1	.
``	Small	net	inflows	into	stock	and	bond	funds	were	offset	*-1	by	slight	declines	in	the	value	of	mutual	fund	stock	and	bond	portfolios	''	stemming	from	falling	prices	,	said	0	*T*-2	Jacob	Dreyer	,	the	institute	's	chief	economist	.
Many	small	investors	went	for	the	safety	of	money	market	funds	.
Assets	of	these	and	other	short-term	funds	surged	more	than	$	5	billion	*U*	in	September	,	the	institute	said	0	*T*-1	.
Analysts	say	0	additional	investors	transferred	their	assets	into	money	funds	this	month	.
At	Fidelity	Investments	,	the	nation	's	largest	fund	group	,	money	funds	continue	*-1	to	draw	the	most	business	,	says	0	*T*-2	Michael	Hines	,	vice	president	,	marketing	.
In	October	,	net	sales	of	stock	funds	at	Fidelity	dropped	sharply	,	Mr.	Hines	said	0	*T*-1	.
But	he	emphasized	that	new	accounts	,	new	sales	,	inquiries	and	subsequent	sales	of	stock	funds	are	all	up	this	month	from	September	's	level	.
Investor	interest	in	stock	funds	``	has	n't	stalled	at	all	,	''	Mr.	Hines	maintains	0	*T*-1	.
He	notes	that	most	of	the	net	sales	drop	stemmed	from	a	three-day	period	following	the	Friday	the	13th	plunge	.
``	If	that	follows	through	next	month	,	then	it	will	be	a	different	story	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
But	,	Mr.	Hines	adds	,	0	sales	``	based	*	on	a	few	days	'	events	do	n't	tell	you	much	about	October	's	trends	.	''
One	trend	that	*T*-1	continues	is	growth	in	the	money	invested	*	in	funds	.
*-3	Buoyed	*-1	by	the	continued	inflows	into	money	funds	,	assets	of	all	mutual	funds	swelled	to	a	record	$	953.8	billion	*U*	in	September	,	up	fractionally	from	$	949.3	billion	*U*	in	August	.
Stock-fund	managers	,	meantime	,	went	into	October	with	less	cash	on	hand	than	they	held	*?*	earlier	this	year	.
These	managers	held	9.8	%	of	assets	in	cash	at	the	end	of	September	,	down	from	10.2	%	in	August	and	10.6	%	in	September	1988	.
Large	cash	positions	help	buffer	funds	from	market	declines	but	can	cut	down	on	gains	in	rising	markets	.
Managers	of	junk	funds	were	bolstering	their	cash	hoards	after	the	September	cash	crunch	at	Campeau	Corp	.
Junk-portfolio	managers	raised	their	cash	position	to	9.4	%	of	assets	in	September	from	8.3	%	in	August	.
In	September	1988	,	that	level	was	9.5	%	.
Investors	in	all	funds	will	seek	safety	in	the	coming	months	,	some	analysts	say	0	*T*-1	.
Among	stock	funds	,	the	conservative	growth-and-income	portfolios	probably	will	remain	popular	,	fund	specialists	say	0	*T*-1	.
``	There	will	be	a	continuation	and	possibly	greater	focus	on	conservative	equity	funds	,	at	the	expense	of	growth	and	aggressive	growth	funds	,	''	says	*T*-1	Avi	Nachmany	,	an	analyst	at	Strategic	Insight	,	a	New	York	fund-research	concern	.
Secretary	of	State	Baker	,	we	read	0	*T*-1	,	decided	*-2	to	kill	a	speech	that	Robert	Gates	,	deputy	national	security	adviser	and	a	career	Soviet	expert	,	was	going	*-4	to	give	*T*-3	to	a	student	colloquium	,	the	National	Collegiate	Security	Conference	.
We	keep	*-3	wondering	what	Mr.	Gates	wanted	*-2	to	say	*T*-1	.
Perhaps	he	might	have	cited	Mr.	Gorbachev	's	need	for	``	a	stable	currency	,	free	and	competitive	markets	,	private	property	and	real	prices	''	and	other	pie-in-the-sky	reforms	.
Perhaps	he	'd	have	called	for	``	a	decentralized	political	and	economic	system	''	without	a	dominant	communist	party	.
Or	political	arrangements	0	``	*	to	alleviate	the	grievances	and	demands	of	Soviet	ethnic	minorities	and	republics	*T*-1	.	''
Why	,	a	Bob	Gates	might	even	have	said	,	``	Nor	are	Soviet	problems	susceptible	to	rescue	from	abroad	through	abundant	Western	credits	.	''
If	Mr.	Gates	had	been	allowed	*-1	to	say	these	things	,	we	would	now	be	hearing	about	``	discord	''	and	``	disarray	''	on	foreign	policy	.
Dark	hints	*ICH*-1	would	be	raised	*-2	that	parts	of	the	administration	hope	0	Mr.	Gorbachev	would	fail	,	just	as	they	were	*?*	when	Vice	President	Quayle	voiced	similar	sentiments	*T*-3	.
It	*EXP*-1	's	somehow	OK	for	Secretary	Baker	himself	,	however	,	to	say	all	the	same	things	.
In	fact	,	he	did	*?*	;	the	quotes	above	are	from	Mr.	Baker	's	speech	of	two	weeks	ago	.
So	far	as	we	can	see	*?*	,	there	is	no	disagreement	among	Mr.	Baker	,	Mr.	Quayle	,	the	Mr.	Gates	0	we	've	read	*T*-1	,	or	for	that	matter	President	Bush	.
They	all	understand	point	one	:	Nothing	0	the	U.S.	can	do	*T*-1	will	make	much	difference	in	whether	Mr.	Gorbachev	succeeds	with	perestroika	.
Perhaps	Mr.	Gates	would	emphasize	more	than	Mr.	Baker	the	many	hurdles	0	the	Soviet	leader	must	leap	*T*-1	if	he	is	going	*-2	to	succeed	.
But	everyone	agrees	that	Mr.	Gorbachev	's	problems	result	from	the	failure	of	his	own	system	.
They	can	be	relieved	*-1	only	by	*	changing	that	system	,	not	by	*	pouring	Western	money	into	it	.
GATT	membership	will	not	matter	to	Donbas	coal	miners	short	of	soap	,	nor	will	a	START	treaty	make	any	difference	to	Ukrainian	nationalists	.
On	the	other	hand	,	so	long	as	Mr.	Gorbachev	is	easing	his	grip	on	his	empire	,	everyone	0	we	've	heard	*T*-1	agrees	that	the	U.S.	can	benefit	by	*-2	engaging	him	.
If	a	deal	*ICH*-2	can	be	made	*-1	0	*	to	cut	the	world	's	Ortegas	*-4	loose	from	Moscow	*T*-3	,	why	not	?
We	do	n't	expect	much	good	from	nuclear-arms	control	,	but	conventional-arms	talks	might	demilitarize	Eastern	Europe	.
There	's	nothing	in	the	least	contradictory	in	all	this	,	and	it	*EXP*-2	would	be	nice	*	to	think	that	Washington	could	tolerate	a	reasonably	sophisticated	,	complex	view	.
Yet	much	of	the	political	culture	seems	intent	on	*	castigating	the	Bush	administration	for	*	not	``	helping	''	Mr.	Gorbachev	.
So	every	time	0	a	Bush	official	raises	a	doubt	about	Mr.	Gorbachev	*T*-1	,	the	Washington	community	shouts	``	Cold	War	''	and	``	timidity	,	''	and	an	administration	spokesman	is	quickly	trotted	out	*-2	*-3	to	reply	,	``	Mr.	Bush	wants	perestroika	to	succeed	.	''
Mr.	Baker	seems	especially	sensitive	to	the	Washington	ailment	known	*	as	Beltway-itis	.
Its	symptoms	include	a	cold	sweat	at	the	sound	of	debate	,	clammy	hands	in	the	face	of	congressional	criticism	,	and	fainting	spells	when	someone	writes	the	word	``	controversy	*T*-1	.	''
As	one	unidentified	official	clearly	in	the	late	stages	of	the	disease	told	the	Times	:	``	Baker	just	felt	that	there	were	some	lines	in	the	speech	that	*T*-2	could	be	misinterpreted	and	seized	*-1	by	the	press	.	''
In	short	,	the	problem	is	not	intra-administration	disagreement	,	but	preoccupation	with	the	prospect	that	perestrokia	might	fail	,	and	its	political	opponents	will	ask	``	Who	*T*-1	lost	Gorbachev	?	''
Mr.	Baker	may	want	*-1	to	avoid	criticism	from	Senate	Majority	Leader	George	Mitchell	,	but	as	Secretary	of	State	his	audience	is	the	entire	Free	World	,	not	just	Congress	.
In	any	case	,	he	's	likely	*-1	to	find	that	the	more	he	muzzles	his	colleagues	,	the	more	leaks	will	pop	up	all	around	Washington	,	a	lesson	once	learned	*	by	Henry	Kissinger	.
*	Letting	officials	express	their	own	nuances	can	be	educational	.
We	note	that	in	Rome	yesterday	Defense	Secretary	Cheney	said	that	European	euphoria	over	Mr.	Gorbachev	is	starting	*-2	to	be	tempered	*-1	by	a	recognition	of	``	the	magnitude	of	the	problems	0	he	was	trying	*-4	to	deal	with	*T*-3	.	''
It	*ICH*-1	is	in	the	Western	interest	*	to	see	Mr.	Gorbachev	succeed	.
The	odds	are	against	him	,	as	he	himself	would	no	doubt	tell	you	.
The	ultimate	outcome	depends	on	what	he	does	*T*-1	,	not	on	what	we	do	*T*-2	.
Even	if	the	press	is	ready	*-1	to	seize	and	misinterpret	,	these	are	not	very	complicated	thoughts	.
Surely	there	is	someone	in	the	administration	,	maybe	Bob	Gates	,	who	*T*-1	could	explain	them	to	college	students	,	or	even	schoolchildren	.
Vernon	E.	Jordan	was	elected	*-1	to	the	board	of	this	transportation	services	concern	.
Mr.	Jordan	has	served	as	executive	director	of	the	United	Negro	College	Fund	,	director	of	the	Voter	Education	Project	of	the	Southern	Regional	Council	and	attorney-consultant	to	the	U.S.	Office	of	Economic	Opportunity	.
His	election	increases	Ryder	's	board	to	14	members	.
The	American	Stock	Exchange	said	0	a	seat	was	sold	*-1	for	$	160,000	*U*	,	down	$	5,000	*U*	from	the	previous	sale	last	Friday	.
Seats	are	currently	quoted	*-1	at	$	151,000	*U*	,	bid	*	,	and	$	162,000	*U*	,	asked	*	.
Two	gunmen	entered	a	Maryland	restaurant	,	ordered	two	employees	to	lie	on	the	floor	and	shot	them	in	the	backs	of	their	heads	.
The	killers	fled	with	less	than	$	100	*U*	.
*-1	Describing	this	and	other	grisly	killings	,	Sen.	Strom	Thurmond	-LRB-	R.	,	S.C	.	-RRB-	recently	urged	fellow	lawmakers	*-2	to	revive	a	broad	federal	death	penalty	.
``	The	ultimate	punishment	,	''	he	declared	*T*-2	,	``	will	protect	the	law-abiding	from	the	vicious	,	cruel	individuals	who	*T*-1	commit	these	crimes	.	''
There	's	just	one	problem	:	The	law	that	Sen.	Thurmond	is	pushing	*T*-1	would	be	irrelevant	in	the	case	of	the	Maryland	restaurant	murders	and	almost	all	other	killings	.
Most	murders	are	state	crimes	,	so	any	federal	capital-punishment	law	probably	would	turn	out	*-1	to	be	more	symbolism	than	substance	.
Yet	the	bill	is	riding	high	on	the	furor	over	drug	trafficking	.
Senate	Republicans	,	after	*-2	repeatedly	failing	*-1	to	attach	death-penalty	amendments	to	unrelated	legislation	,	have	finally	gotten	a	full-blown	death-penalty	bill	through	committee	.
The	Democratic	leadership	agreed	*-1	to	allow	a	floor	vote	on	the	issue	*ICH*-2	before	the	end	of	the	year	--	a	debate	certain	*	to	focus	on	the	alleged	racial	inequality	of	death	sentencing	.
Even	some	Democrats	concede	that	there	is	probably	a	majority	in	the	Senate	that	*T*-1	favors	some	kind	of	broad	capital-punishment	measure	.
The	pending	bill	,	introduced	*	by	Mr.	Thurmond	,	would	revive	the	long-dormant	federal	death-penalty	laws	by	*-1	instituting	legal	procedures	required	*	by	the	Supreme	Court	.
In	1972	,	the	high	court	swept	aside	all	capital-punishment	laws	--	federal	and	state	alike	--	as	unconstitutional	.
But	in	1976	,	the	court	permitted	resurrection	of	such	laws	,	if	they	meet	certain	procedural	requirements	.
For	instance	,	juries	would	have	*-1	to	consider	specific	``	aggravating	''	and	``	mitigating	''	factors	before	*-2	deciding	whether	*-3	to	condemn	someone	to	death	.
Since	that	1976	ruling	,	37	states	have	reintroduced	the	death	penalty	.
But	congressional	Democrats	have	blocked	the	same	from	*-1	occurring	at	the	federal	level	,	with	the	exception	of	a	1988	law	allowing	capital	punishment	for	certain	drug-related	homicides	.
The	Thurmond	bill	would	establish	a	federally	administered	death	sentence	for	23	crimes	,	most	of	which	*T*-1	were	formerly	punishable	by	death	under	federal	statutes	that	the	Supreme	Court	invalidated	*T*-2	.
Among	these	crimes	are	*T*-1	murder	on	federal	land	,	presidential	assassination	and	espionage	.
The	Thurmond	bill	would	also	add	five	new	crimes	punishable	by	death	,	including	murder	for	hire	.
-LRB-	Separately	,	the	Senate	last	week	passed	a	bill	permitting	execution	of	terrorists	who	*T*-1	kill	Americans	abroad	.	-RRB-
Amid	the	swirl	of	punitive	rhetoric	surrounding	the	issue	,	one	critical	question	involves	whether	a	federal	death	penalty	,	on	top	of	existing	state	laws	,	would	deter	any	would-be	criminals	.
For	one	thing	,	it	*EXP*-1	's	unlikely	that	many	people	would	receive	federal	death	sentences	,	let	alone	be	executed	*-2	.
Most	of	the	crimes	incorporated	*	in	the	Thurmond	bill	*ICH*-2	are	exceedingly	rare	--	*	killing	a	Supreme	Court	justice	,	for	instance	,	or	deliberately	causing	a	train	wreck	that	*T*-3	results	in	a	death	.
In	fact	,	only	28	defendants	would	have	been	eligible	for	federal	death	sentences	if	the	Thurmond	bill	had	been	in	effect	in	the	past	three	years	,	according	to	a	study	by	the	Senate	Judiciary	Committee	's	Democratic	staff	.
The	last	federal	execution	before	the	Supreme	Court	's	1972	ruling	banning	the	death	penalty	took	place	in	1963	,	*	meaning	that	the	federal	government	did	n't	exercise	its	execution	authority	for	eight	years	.
``	In	that	sense	,	the	whole	debate	is	sort	of	a	fraud	,	''	argues	*T*-1	a	Democratic	Senate	staff	member	.
``	It	's	distracting	attention	from	serious	issues	,	like	how	*	to	make	DEA	,	FBI	and	Customs	work	together	''	on	drug	enforcement	*T*-1	.
Republicans	acknowledge	that	few	people	would	be	executed	*-1	under	the	Thurmond	bill	,	but	they	contend	0	that	is	n't	the	point	.
``	Many	scholars	are	of	the	opinion	that	the	mere	existence	of	the	penalty	deters	many	people	from	the	commission	of	capital	crimes	,	''	says	*T*-1	Sen.	Orrin	Hatch	-LRB-	R.	,	Utah	-RRB-	.
Executions	,	regardless	of	how	frequently	they	occur	*T*-1	,	are	also	``	proper	retribution	''	for	heinous	crimes	,	Mr.	Hatch	argues	0	*T*-2	.
Thomas	Boyd	,	a	senior	Justice	Department	official	,	says	0	the	new	federal	drug-related	crimes	punishable	by	death	since	last	November	may	result	in	a	jump	in	capital	sentences	,	though	that	has	n't	happened	so	far	.
In	addition	to	*	resuscitating	the	old	issue	of	whether	death	sentences	deter	criminals	,	this	bill	has	made	race	a	major	part	of	the	death-penalty	debate	.
Before	the	bill	left	committee	,	Sen.	Edward	Kennedy	-LRB-	D.	,	Mass	.	-RRB-	attached	an	amendment	that	*T*-1	would	allow	a	defendant	to	escape	from	a	death	sentence	in	jurisdictions	shown	*	to	have	meted	out	executions	in	a	racist	manner	.
The	amendment	prompted	an	ironic	protest	from	Mr.	Thurmond	,	who	*T*-1	complained	that	it	would	``	kill	''	capital	punishment	.
A	large	number	of	studies	suggest	that	state	judges	and	juries	have	imposed	the	penalty	in	a	racially	discriminatory	fashion	.
And	the	Kennedy	amendment	would	invade	not	only	federal	but	state	sentencings	,	in	two	important	ways	.
It	would	allow	all	defendants	to	introduce	statistical	evidence	showing	racially	disproportionate	application	of	the	death	penalty	in	the	past	.
And	it	would	shift	the	burden	*ICH*-1	to	prosecutors	*	to	disprove	that	discrimination	caused	any	statistical	racial	disparities	.
``	That	burden	is	very	difficult	,	if	not	impossible	,	0	*	to	meet	*T*-2	,	''	says	*T*-1	Mr.	Boyd	.
``	How	do	you	prove	a	negative	*T*-1	?	''
Since	most	prosecutors	would	n't	be	able	*-2	to	demonstrate	conclusively	that	racial	considerations	did	n't	affect	sentencing	,	executions	everywhere	might	come	to	a	halt	,	Mr.	Boyd	explains	0	*T*-1	.
At	least	15	major	studies	purport	*-1	to	show	that	particular	states	have	imposed	the	death	penalty	disproportionately	against	killers	of	whites	compared	with	blacks	,	and	against	black	defendants	compared	with	white	defendants	.
Conservatives	question	the	validity	of	the	studies	and	note	that	the	Supreme	Court	ruled	in	1987	that	such	research	,	regardless	of	its	accuracy	,	is	n't	relevant	to	a	constitutional	attack	on	a	particular	death	sentence	.
The	Kennedy	amendment	would	,	in	effect	,	legislate	around	the	Supreme	Court	ruling	.
Lawyers	would	eagerly	seize	on	the	provision	in	their	death-penalty	appeals	,	says	*T*-1	Richard	Burr	,	director	of	the	NAACP	Legal	Defense	and	Educational	Fund	's	capital-punishment	defense	team	.
Mr.	Kennedy	failed	*-1	to	get	his	amendment	incorporated	into	last	year	's	anti-drug	legislation	,	and	it	will	be	severely	attacked	*-2	on	the	Senate	floor	this	time	around	.
But	if	it	survives	,	it	could	prompt	other	statutory	changes	,	according	to	the	Mr.	Burr	.
It	might	force	Congress	and	the	states	to	narrow	the	death	penalty	only	to	convictions	shown	*	to	be	relatively	free	of	racial	imbalance	--	murders	by	repeat	offenders	who	*T*-1	torture	their	victims	,	perhaps	.
*	Narrowing	the	penalty	in	this	fashion	would	clearly	reduce	whatever	deterrent	effect	it	now	has	*T*-1	.
And	that	,	in	turn	,	would	only	strengthen	the	argument	of	those	who	*T*-1	oppose	execution	under	any	circumstances	.
A	state	judge	postponed	a	decision	on	a	move	by	holders	of	Telerate	Inc.	0	*	to	block	the	tender	offer	of	Dow	Jones	&	Co.	for	the	33	%	of	Telerate	0	it	does	n't	already	own	*T*-1	*T*-2	.
Vice	Chancellor	Maurice	A.	Hartnett	III	of	Delaware	's	Court	of	Chancery	heard	arguments	for	more	than	two	hours	here	,	but	he	made	no	comment	and	asked	no	questions	.
He	could	rule	as	early	as	today	on	the	motion	seeking	a	temporary	injunction	against	the	Dow	Jones	offer	.
Dow	Jones	has	offered	*-1	to	pay	$	18	*U*	a	share	,	or	about	$	576	million	*U*	,	for	the	remaining	Telerate	stake	.
The	offer	will	expire	at	5	p.m.	EST	on	Nov.	6	,	unless	*-1	extended	*-2	again	.
Robert	Kornreich	,	an	attorney	for	the	Telerate	holders	,	told	Judge	Hartnett	0	the	Dow	Jones	offer	is	``	arrogant	''	and	``	hostile	.	''
He	accused	Dow	Jones	of	``	*-1	using	unfair	means	*-2	to	obtain	the	stock	at	an	unfair	price	.	''
Michael	Rauch	,	an	attorney	for	Dow	Jones	,	defended	the	offer	as	adequate	,	based	on	what	the	company	considers	*T*-1	realistic	projections	of	Telerate	's	revenue	growth	,	in	the	range	of	12	%	.
He	also	contended	that	the	plaintiffs	failed	*-2	to	cite	any	legal	authority	that	*T*-1	would	justify	such	an	injunction	.
Telerate	provides	information	about	financial	markets	through	an	electronic	network	.

Japan	's	exports	of	cars	,	trucks	and	buses	declined	2.4	%	to	535,322	units	in	September	from	a	year	earlier	,	the	Japan	Automobile	Manufacturers	Association	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	association	attributed	the	drop	to	a	trend	*ICH*-1	among	auto	makers	*	to	move	manufacturing	operations	overseas	.
With	the	exception	of	August	,	when	exports	rose	2.1	%	*T*-1	,	exports	have	declined	every	month	from	year-earlier	levels	since	March	.
Lone	Star	Technologies	Inc.	said	0	its	Lone	Star	Steel	Co.	unit	sued	it	in	federal	court	here	,	*-1	seeking	*-2	to	recover	an	intercompany	receivable	valued	*	at	a	minimum	of	$	23	million	*U*	.
The	lawsuit	was	filed	*-1	by	Lone	Star	Steel	's	unsecured	creditors	'	committee	on	behalf	of	Lone	Star	Steel	,	which	*T*-2	has	been	operating	under	Chapter	11	of	the	federal	Bankruptcy	Code	since	June	30	.
Lone	Star	Technologies	said	0	it	and	its	subsidiary	's	creditors	agree	that	the	parent	company	owes	the	unit	money	,	but	they	have	n't	been	able	*-1	to	reach	agreement	on	the	amount	.
Judith	Elkin	,	lawyer	for	the	creditors	,	said	0	the	creditors	group	is	challenging	certain	accounting	entries	on	the	parent	company	's	books	and	estimates	that	the	receivable	owed	the	steel	company	*	could	be	as	much	as	$	40	million	*U*	.
The	Lone	Star	Steel	lawsuit	also	asks	the	court	*-2	to	rule	that	Lone	Star	Technologies	is	jointly	responsible	for	a	$	4.5	million	*U*	Lone	Star	Steel	pension	payment	that	*T*-1	was	due	,	but	was	n't	paid	*-3	,	in	September	and	that	the	parent	company	ca	n't	recover	the	amount	from	its	subsidiary	if	the	parent	company	makes	the	payment	.
Separately	,	Lone	Star	Technologies	said	0	the	bankruptcy	court	granted	Lone	Star	Steel	an	extension	until	year	end	on	its	exclusive	period	0	*	to	present	a	reorganization	plan	*T*-1	.
The	120-day	exclusivity	period	was	*-1	to	expire	yesterday	.
Under	Chapter	11	,	a	company	continues	*-1	to	operate	,	but	is	protected	from	creditor	lawsuits	while	it	tries	*-2	to	work	out	a	plan	*	to	pay	its	debt	.
Nothing	was	going	*-1	to	hold	up	the	long-delayed	settlement	of	Britton	vs.	Thomasini	.
Not	even	an	earthquake	.
On	the	afternoon	of	Oct.	17	,	after	hours	of	*	haggling	with	five	insurance-claims	adjusters	over	*	settling	a	toxic-waste	suit	,	four	lawyers	had	an	agreement	in	hand	.
But	as	Judge	Thomas	M.	Jenkins	donned	his	robes	so	he	could	give	final	approval	,	the	major	earthquake	struck	,	its	epicenter	not	far	from	his	courtroom	in	Redwood	City	,	Calif	.
The	walls	shook	;	the	building	rocked	.
For	a	while	,	it	looked	like	the	deal	--	*	not	to	mention	the	courtroom	itself	--	was	on	the	verge	of	collapse	.
``	The	judge	came	out	and	said	,	`	Quick	,	*	let	's	put	this	on	the	record	,	'	''	says	*T*-1	Sandy	Bettencourt	,	the	judge	's	court	reporter	.
``	I	said	,	`	NOW	?	'
I	was	shaking	the	whole	time	.	''
A	10-gallon	water	cooler	had	toppled	onto	the	floor	,	*	soaking	the	red	carpeting	.
Lights	flickered	on	and	off	;	plaster	dropped	from	the	ceiling	,	the	walls	still	shook	and	an	evacuation	alarm	blared	outside	.
The	four	lawyers	climbed	out	from	under	a	table	.
``	*	Let	's	close	the	door	,	''	said	*T*-1	the	judge	as	he	climbed	to	his	bench	.
At	stake	was	*T*-3	an	$	80,000	*U*	settlement	involving	who	*T*-1	should	pay	what	share	of	cleanup	costs	at	the	site	of	a	former	gas	station	,	where	underground	fuel	tanks	had	leaked	and	contaminated	the	soil	*T*-2	.
And	the	lawyers	were	just	as	eager	as	the	judge	*-1	to	wrap	it	up	.
``	We	were	never	going	*-2	to	get	these	insurance	companies	to	agree	again	,	''	says	*T*-1	John	V.	Trump	,	a	San	Francisco	defense	lawyer	in	the	case	.
Indeed	,	the	insurance	adjusters	had	already	bolted	out	of	the	courtroom	.
The	lawyers	went	to	work	anyway	,	*-1	duly	noting	that	the	proceeding	was	taking	place	during	a	major	earthquake	.
Ten	minutes	later	,	it	was	done	*-1	.
For	the	record	,	Jeffrey	Kaufman	,	an	attorney	for	Fireman	's	Fund	,	said	0	he	was	``	rattled	--	both	literally	and	figuratively	.	''
``	My	belief	is	always	,	0	if	you	've	got	a	settlement	,	you	read	it	into	the	record	.	''	says	*T*-1	Judge	Jenkins	,	now	known	*	in	his	courthouse	as	``	Shake	'Em	Down	Jenkins	.	''
The	insurance	adjusters	think	differently	.
``	I	did	n't	know	if	it	was	World	War	III	or	what	,	''	says	*T*-1	Melanie	Carvain	of	Morristown	,	N.J	.

Applause	for	``	Sometimes	,	Talk	Is	the	Best	Medicine	,	''	in	your	Oct.	5	Marketplace	section	.
Indeed	,	the	``	art	of	doctoring	''	does	contribute	to	better	health	results	and	discourages	unwarranted	malpractice	litigation	.
*	Elaborating	on	the	concern	about	doctors	'	sacrificing	earnings	in	order	*-1	to	spend	``	talk	time	''	with	patients	,	we	are	finding	0	the	quality	of	the	time	spent	*	is	the	key	to	true	rapport	.
Even	brief	conversations	can	show	caring	and	trust	,	and	need	*-1	not	restrict	the	efficiency	of	the	communication	or	restrain	the	doctor	's	earnings	.
The	issue	is	far-reaching	.
Right	now	,	the	American	populace	is	spending	about	12	%	of	our	gross	national	product	on	health	care	.
That	amounts	to	more	than	$	350	billion	*U*	a	year	.
And	it	is	estimated	that	more	than	20	%	of	that	,	$	70	billion	*U*	,	goes	to	``	defensive	medicine	''	--	those	measures	taken	*	by	doctors	*	to	protect	themselves	from	the	most	unlikely	possibilities	.

Chrysler	Corp.	Chairman	Lee	A.	Iacocca	said	0	the	nation	's	No.	3	auto	maker	will	need	*-1	to	close	one	or	two	of	its	assembly	plants	because	of	the	slowdown	hitting	the	industry	.
In	an	interview	with	the	trade	journal	Automotive	News	,	Mr.	Iacocca	declined	*-2	to	say	which	plants	*T*-1	will	close	or	when	Chrysler	will	make	the	moves	*T*-3	.
But	he	said	,	``	we	have	too	many	plants	in	our	system	.
So	the	older	or	most	inefficient	capacity	has	got	*-1	to	go	.	''
According	to	industry	analysts	,	Chrysler	plants	most	likely	*	to	close	are	the	St.	Louis	No.	1	facility	,	which	*T*-1	builds	Chrysler	LeBaron	and	Dodge	Daytona	models	;	the	Toledo	,	Ohio	,	Jeep	plant	,	which	*T*-2	dates	back	to	the	early	1900s	;	and	two	Canadian	plants	that	*T*-3	build	the	Jeep	Wrangler	and	Chrysler	's	full-sized	vans	.
Chrysler	has	had	*-1	to	temporarily	close	the	St.	Louis	and	Toledo	plants	recently	because	of	excess	inventories	of	vehicles	built	*	there	.
At	Chrysler	's	1990	model	preview	last	month	,	Chrysler	Motors	President	Robert	A.	Lutz	said	0	the	No.	3	auto	maker	,	along	with	other	U.S.	manufacturers	,	might	be	forced	*-1	to	``	realign	...	capacity	''	if	market	demand	does	n't	improve	.
But	Mr.	Iacocca	's	remarks	are	the	most	specific	indication	to	date	of	how	many	plants	*T*-1	could	be	in	jeopardy	.
General	Motors	Corp.	has	signaled	that	as	many	as	five	of	its	U.S.	and	Canadian	plants	may	not	survive	the	mid-1990s	as	it	struggles	*-1	to	trim	its	excess	vehicle-production	capacity	.
The	overcapacity	problem	has	intensified	in	recent	years	,	with	foreign	auto	makers	beginning	car	and	truck	production	in	the	U.S.	.
With	companies	such	as	Honda	Motor	Co.	,	Toyota	Motor	Corp.	and	Nissan	Motor	Co.	running	so-called	transplant	auto	operations	,	Japanese	auto	production	in	the	U.S.	will	reach	one	million	vehicles	this	year	.
``	Unless	the	market	goes	to	19	million	units	--	which	we	all	know	0	it	's	not	going	*-3	to	do	*T*-1	--	we	have	the	inescapable	fact	that	the	transplants	are	adding	capacity	,	''	Mr.	Lutz	said	*T*-2	last	month	.
The	Japanese-managed	plants	eventually	will	have	the	capacity	*	to	build	some	2.5	million	vehicles	in	the	U.S.	and	that	will	translate	into	``	market	share	that	*T*-1	is	going	*-2	to	have	*-3	to	come	out	of	somebody	,	''	he	added	0	*T*-4	.
Already	Chrysler	has	closed	the	Kenosha	,	Wis.	,	plant	0	it	acquired	*T*-1	when	it	bought	American	Motors	Corp.	in	1987	*T*-2	.
Chrysler	has	also	launched	a	$	1	billion	*U*	cost-cutting	program	that	*T*-1	will	cut	about	2,300	white-collar	workers	from	the	payroll	in	the	next	few	months	.
Revco	D.S.	Inc.	,	the	drugstore	chain	that	*T*-1	filed	for	bankruptcy-court	protection	last	year	,	received	a	$	925	million	*U*	offer	from	a	group	led	*	by	Texas	billionaire	Robert	Bass	.
Revco	reacted	cautiously	,	*-1	saying	0	the	plan	would	add	$	260	million	*U*	of	new	debt	to	the	highly	leveraged	company	.
It	*EXP*-1	was	Revco	's	huge	debt	from	its	$	1.3	billion	*U*	leveraged	buy-out	in	1986	that	*T*-2	forced	it	to	seek	protection	under	Chapter	11	of	the	federal	Bankruptcy	Code	.
Revco	insists	that	the	proposal	is	simply	an	``	expression	of	interest	,	''	because	under	Chapter	11	Revco	has	``	exclusivity	rights	''	until	Feb.	28	.
Those	rights	prevent	anyone	other	than	Revco	from	*-1	proposing	a	reorganization	plan	.
Also	under	Chapter	11	,	a	reorganization	plan	is	subject	to	approval	by	bondholders	,	banks	and	other	creditors	.
A	financial	adviser	for	Revco	bondholders	,	David	Schulte	,	of	Chilmark	Partners	,	had	mixed	reactions	to	the	offer	.
He	said	0	he	feared	0	a	Revco	reorganization	might	force	bondholders	to	accept	a	``	cheap	deal	,	''	and	that	the	Bass	group	's	offer	would	give	them	more	money	.
However	,	the	group	is	offering	*-1	to	pay	off	bondholders	in	cash	only	--	$	260.5	million	*U*	--	and	no	equity	.
The	Revco	bonds	are	high-yield	,	high-risk	``	junk	''	bonds	;	holders	have	$	750	million	*U*	in	claims	against	Revco	,	Mr.	Schulte	said	0	*T*-1	.
Revco	received	the	offer	Oct.	20	,	but	issued	a	response	yesterday	only	after	a	copy	of	the	proposal	was	made	*-1	public	by	bondholders	.
Acadia	Partners	Limited	Partnership	,	a	Fort	Worth	,	Texas	,	partnership	that	*T*-1	includes	the	Robert	M.	Bass	Group	,	made	the	proposal	.
Mr.	Bass	is	based	*-1	in	Fort	Worth	.
Analysts	said	0	the	nation	's	second-largest	drugstore	chain	was	a	valuable	company	,	despite	its	financial	woes	.
Its	problem	,	they	say	*T*-1	,	is	that	management	paid	too	much	in	the	leveraged	buy-out	and	the	current	$	515	million	*U*	debt	load	is	keeping	Revco	in	the	red	.
``	If	*	bought	at	the	right	price	,	it	could	still	be	profitable	,	''	said	*T*-1	Jeffrey	Stein	,	an	analyst	at	McDonald	&	Co.	,	Cleveland	.
In	addition	,	Revco	's	1,900	stores	in	27	states	represent	a	lot	of	real	estate	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	,	and	demographics	are	helping	pharmacies	:	The	nation	's	aging	population	will	boost	demand	for	prescription	drugs	.
Last	week	,	Revco	's	parent	company	,	Anac	Holding	Corp.	,	said	0	the	company	reported	a	loss	of	$	16.2	million	*U*	for	the	fiscal	first	quarter	,	compared	with	a	loss	of	$	27.9	million	*U*	in	the	year-earlier	quarter	.
Sales	were	$	597.8	million	*U*	,	up	2.4	%	from	the	previous	year	.
The	company	,	based	*	in	Twinsburg	,	Ohio	,	said	0	its	operating	profit	before	depreciation	and	amortization	increased	51	%	,	to	$	9.2	million	*U*	from	$	6.1	million	*U*	.
Acadia	Partners	and	the	Bass	Group	declined	*-1	to	comment	.
The	partnership	also	includes	American	Express	Co.	,	Equitable	Life	Assurance	Society	of	the	U.S.	and	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	Inc	.
The	offer	consists	of	$	410.5	million	*U*	in	cash	and	the	rest	in	notes	.
Acadia	would	sell	up	to	10	%	of	the	equity	in	the	reorganized	company	to	creditors	and	bondholders	in	exchange	for	the	cash	distribution	,	but	creditors	and	bondholders	would	receive	no	discount	for	their	shares	.
Revco	's	chairman	and	chief	executive	officer	,	Boake	A.	Sells	,	said	0	both	the	company	and	the	bondholders	have	put	forth	reorganization	plans	,	but	little	progress	has	been	made	*-1	since	negotiations	began	this	summer	.
He	said	0	he	has	not	met	with	representatives	from	Acadia	.
Any	reorganization	proposal	,	Mr.	Sells	said	0	*T*-1	,	is	difficult	0	*	to	assess	*T*-3	because	it	must	be	agreed	upon	*-2	by	the	company	,	bondholders	,	banks	and	other	creditors	.
Revco	has	$	1.5	billion	*U*	in	claims	outstanding	.
``	It	's	not	like	the	board	can	decide	''	by	itself	,	Mr.	Sells	said	0	*T*-1	,	*-2	adding	,	``	we	're	indifferent	to	-LRB-	the	Bass	-RRB-	plan	.
We	just	want	a	plan	that	*T*-1	satisfies	creditors	and	*T*-1	at	the	end	leaves	a	healthy	Revco	.	''
But	Mr.	Schulte	,	the	bondholders	'	adviser	,	said	0	Revco	was	dragging	its	feet	in	*-1	responding	to	the	proposal	.
``	They	want	*-2	to	pretend	0	it	does	n't	exist	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Schulte	,	who	*T*-1	met	with	Acadia	representatives	on	Oct.	10	,	said	,	``	It	's	certainly	a	responsible	offer	.
It	's	not	an	effort	*	to	steal	the	company	''	in	the	middle	of	the	night	.
Copper	futures	prices	failed	*-1	to	extend	Friday	's	rally	.
Declines	came	because	of	concern	that	demand	for	copper	may	slow	down	.
The	December	contract	was	down	three	cents	a	pound	,	*-2	settling	at	$	1.1280	*U*	,	which	*T*-1	was	just	above	the	day	's	low	of	$	1.1270	*U*	.
Futures	prices	fell	during	three	of	five	sessions	last	week	,	and	the	losses	,	individually	and	cumulatively	,	were	greater	than	the	advances	.
Two	of	the	major	factors	buoying	prices	,	the	prolonged	strikes	at	the	Highland	Valley	mine	in	Canada	and	the	Cananea	mine	in	Mexico	,	were	finally	resolved	*-1	.
Also	,	the	premiums	paid	*	by	the	U.S.	government	on	a	purchase	of	copper	for	the	U.S.	Mint	were	lower	than	*	expected	,	and	acted	as	a	price	depressant	,	analysts	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	mint	purchases	were	at	premiums	about	4	1\/2	cents	a	pound	above	the	respective	prices	for	the	copper	.
At	the	time	merchants	were	asking	for	premiums	of	about	five	cents	a	pound	.
All	this	has	led	to	prolonged	selling	in	futures	,	mostly	on	the	part	of	computer-guided	funds	.
Prices	fell	through	levels	regarded	*	as	important	support	areas	,	which	*T*-1	added	to	the	selling	.
The	reluctance	*ICH*-1	of	traders	*	to	buy	contracts	indicates	that	they	have	begun	*-2	focusing	on	demand	rather	than	supply	.
At	least	one	analyst	noted	that	as	production	improves	,	the	concern	among	traders	is	whether	the	prospective	increased	supply	will	find	buyers	because	of	uncertainty	over	national	economies	.
``	Demand	from	Japan	is	expected	*-3	to	continue	*-4	strong	,	but	not	from	other	areas	of	the	world	into	the	first	quarter	of	next	year	,	''	he	said	*T*-2	.
Japan	normally	depends	heavily	on	the	Highland	Valley	and	Cananea	mines	as	well	as	the	Bougainville	mine	in	Papua	New	Guinea	.
Recently	,	Japan	has	been	buying	copper	elsewhere	.
But	as	Highland	Valley	and	Cananea	begin	*-2	operating	,	they	are	expected	*-1	to	resume	their	roles	as	Japan	's	suppliers	.
According	to	Fred	Demler	,	metals	economist	for	Drexel	Burnham	Lambert	,	New	York	,	``	Highland	Valley	has	already	started	*-1	operating	and	Cananea	is	expected	*-2	to	do	so	soon	.	''
The	Bougainville	mine	is	generally	expected	*-1	to	remain	closed	until	at	least	the	end	of	the	year	.
It	has	n't	been	operating	since	May	15	because	of	attacks	by	native	landowners	.
A	recent	attempt	*	to	resume	operations	was	cut	*-1	short	quickly	by	these	attacks	.
However	,	traders	disregarded	a	potential	production	disruption	in	Chile	and	a	continued	drop	in	inventories	.
Workers	at	two	Chilean	mines	,	Los	Bronces	and	El	Soldado	,	which	*T*-1	belong	to	the	Exxon-owned	Minera	Disputado	group	,	will	vote	Thursday	on	whether	*-2	to	strike	after	a	two-year	labor	pact	ends	today	.
The	mines	produced	a	total	of	110,000	tons	of	copper	in	1988	.
According	to	Drexel	's	Mr.	Demler	,	the	potential	strike	is	expected	*-3	to	be	resolved	*-1	quickly	,	which	*T*-2	may	be	one	reason	why	the	situation	did	n't	affect	prices	much	*T*-4	.
Another	analyst	said	that	,	if	there	was	any	concern	,	it	was	that	a	strike	could	encourage	other	walkouts	in	Chile	.
London	Metal	Exchange	copper	inventories	fell	550	tons	last	week	to	83,950	tons	,	a	smaller-than-expected	decline	.
But	that	development	also	had	little	effect	on	traders	'	sentiment	.
Mr.	Demler	said	that	stocks	of	copper	in	U.S.	producers	'	hands	at	the	end	of	September	were	down	16,000	metric	tons	from	August	to	30,000	tons	.
Outside	the	U.S.	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	,	producer	stocks	at	the	end	of	August	were	273,000	tons	,	down	3,000	tons	from	the	end	of	July	.
Consumer	stocks	of	copper	in	the	U.S.	fell	to	44,000	tons	at	the	end	of	September	from	54,000	tons	a	month	earlier	,	and	stocks	of	copper	held	*	by	consumers	and	merchants	outside	of	the	U.S.	at	the	end	of	July	stood	at	123,000	tons	,	down	from	125,000	tons	in	June	.
The	high	point	of	foreigners	'	copper	stocks	this	year	was	136,000	tons	at	the	end	of	April	,	according	to	Mr.	Demler	.
In	other	commodity	markets	yesterday	:
GRAINS	AND	SOYBEANS	:
The	prices	of	most	corn	,	soybean	and	wheat	futures	contracts	dropped	slightly	as	farmers	in	the	Midwest	continued	*-2	to	rebuild	stockpiles	that	*T*-3	were	depleted	*-1	by	the	1988	drought	.
Buying	by	the	Soviets	has	helped	*-1	to	prop	up	corn	prices	in	recent	weeks	,	but	a	lack	of	any	new	purchases	kept	prices	in	the	doldrums	.
COFFEE	:
Futures	prices	rose	slightly	in	a	market	filled	*	with	rumors	that	a	new	international	coffee	agreement	might	still	be	achieved	*-1	.
The	December	contract	ended	with	a	gain	of	1.29	cents	a	pound	at	74.35	cents	.
According	to	one	analyst	,	prices	opened	higher	because	of	reports	*ICH*-1	over	the	weekend	that	Brazil	and	Colombia	,	at	the	Pan-American	summit	meeting	in	Costa	Rica	,	had	agreed	to	a	reduction	in	their	coffee	export	quotas	for	the	sake	of	*	creating	a	new	agreement	.
The	reports	,	attributed	*	to	the	Colombian	minister	of	economic	development	,	said	0	Brazil	would	give	up	500,000	bags	of	its	quota	and	Colombia	200,000	bags	,	the	analyst	said	0	*T*-3	.
These	reports	were	later	denied	*-2	by	a	high	Brazilian	official	,	who	*T*-1	said	0	Brazil	was	n't	involved	in	any	coffee	discussions	on	quotas	,	the	analyst	said	0	*T*-3	.
The	Colombian	minister	was	said	*-2	to	have	referred	to	a	letter	that	he	said	0	President	Bush	sent	*T*-1	to	Colombian	President	Virgilio	Barco	,	and	in	which	President	Bush	said	*T*-3	0	it	*EXP*-4	was	possible	*	to	overcome	obstacles	to	a	new	agreement	.
The	minister	was	also	quoted	as	*-2	saying	that	a	new	pact	could	be	achieved	*-1	during	the	first	half	of	next	year	,	according	to	the	analyst	.
PRECIOUS	METALS	:
Futures	prices	showed	modest	changes	in	light	trading	volume	.
December	delivery	gold	eased	40	cents	an	ounce	to	$	380.80	*U*	.
December	silver	was	off	3.7	cents	an	ounce	at	$	5.2830	*U*	.
January	platinum	rose	90	cents	an	ounce	at	$	500.20	*U*	.
The	market	turned	quiet	after	*-1	rising	sharply	late	last	week	,	according	to	one	analyst	.
Last	week	's	uncertainty	in	the	stock	market	and	a	weaker	dollar	triggered	a	flight	to	safety	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	,	but	yesterday	the	market	lacked	such	stimuli	.
There	was	some	profit-taking	because	prices	for	all	the	precious	metals	had	risen	to	levels	at	which	there	was	resistance	to	further	advance	*T*-2	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	dollar	was	also	slightly	firmer	and	prompted	some	selling	,	as	well	,	according	to	the	analyst	.
Louisiana-Pacific	Corp.	said	0	its	board	authorized	the	purchase	of	as	many	as	five	million	of	its	common	shares	for	employee	stock	plans	and	other	general	corporate	purposes	.
The	forest-products	concern	currently	has	about	38	million	shares	outstanding	.
In	yesterday	's	composite	trading	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	,	Louisiana-Pacific	shares	closed	at	$	39.25	*U*	,	down	37.5	cents	.
When	the	Supreme	Soviet	passed	laws	on	workers	'	rights	in	May	1987	and	on	self-managing	cooperatives	a	year	later	*T*-4	,	some	Western	observers	assumed	0	Mikhail	Gorbachev	had	launched	the	Soviet	Union	on	a	course	that	*T*-1	would	lead	inevitably	to	the	creation	of	a	market	economy	.
Their	only	doubt	concerned	the	possibility	that	Mr.	Gorbachev	might	not	survive	the	opposition	that	his	reforms	would	arouse	*T*-2	and	that	the	whole	process	might	be	reversed	*-1	.
If	Mr.	Gorbachev	's	goal	is	the	creation	of	a	free	market	,	he	and	these	Western	observers	have	good	reason	0	*	to	fear	for	his	future	*T*-1	,	as	economic	liberalization	within	communist	societies	leads	inexorably	to	demands	for	fundamental	political	reform	accompanied	*	by	civil	unrest	.
These	fears	were	clearly	apparent	when	,	last	week	,	Secretary	of	State	James	Baker	blocked	a	speech	by	Robert	Gates	,	deputy	national	security	adviser	and	Soviet	expert	,	on	the	ground	that	it	was	too	pessimistic	about	the	chances	of	Mr.	Gorbachev	's	economic	reforms	succeeding	*T*-1	.
Yet	the	Soviet	leader	's	readiness	*	to	embark	on	foreign	visits	and	steady	accumulation	of	personal	power	,	particularly	since	the	last	Politburo	reshuffle	on	Sept.	30	,	do	not	suggest	that	Mr.	Gorbachev	is	on	the	verge	of	*	being	toppled	*-1	;	nor	does	he	look	likely	*-2	to	reverse	the	powers	of	perestroika	.
Indeed	,	the	Soviet	miners	strike	this	summer	clearly	demonstrated	that	Mr.	Gorbachev	must	proceed	with	economic	reform	.
But	is	he	so	clever	that	he	has	achieved	the	political	equivalent	of	*	making	water	run	uphill	?
And	has	he	truly	persuaded	the	Communist	Party	*-2	to	accept	economic	change	of	a	kind	that	*T*-1	will	,	sooner	or	later	,	lead	to	its	demise	?
An	alternative	and	more	convincing	explanation	,	confirmed	*	by	recent	events	and	a	close	inspection	of	the	Gorbachev	program	,	is	that	the	new	Soviet	economic	and	social	structures	are	intended	*-1	to	conform	to	a	model	other	than	that	of	the	market	.
For	example	,	while	the	laws	on	individual	labor	activity	allow	a	citizen	to	earn	a	living	independent	of	the	state	,	strict	provisions	*ICH*-1	are	attached	*-2	on	how	far	this	may	lead	*T*-3	to	the	development	of	a	free	market	.
Before	*-1	becoming	self-employed	,	or	setting	up	a	cooperative	,	workers	must	seek	permission	from	the	local	soviet	-LRB-	council	-RRB-	.
Permission	is	far	from	automatic	:	The	soviets	have	the	legal	right	*	to	turn	down	applications	and	impose	conditions	,	and	they	appear	*-1	to	be	exercising	these	powers	.
Private	dressmaking	,	for	example	,	is	allowed	*-1	in	10	Soviet	republics	but	banned	*-1	by	five	;	shoemaking	is	allowed	*-2	in	seven	but	illegal	in	nine	.
The	controls	on	cooperatives	appeared	relatively	liberal	when	*-2	first	introduced	*-3	*T*-1	.
But	that	changed	following	a	resolution	from	the	Supreme	Soviet	banning	cooperatives	from	*-1	operating	in	some	areas	of	the	economy	,	and	permitting	activity	in	others	only	if	the	cooperatives	are	under	contract	to	the	state	.
All	independent	media	activity	is	now	illegal	,	which	*T*-1	perhaps	is	not	surprising	,	but	so	is	*T*-2	the	manufacture	of	perfume	,	cosmetics	,	household	chemicals	and	sand	candles	.
Medical	cooperatives	,	among	the	most	successful	in	the	U.S.S.R.	,	are	banned	*-1	from	*-2	providing	general-practitioner	services	-LRB-	their	main	source	of	income	-RRB-	,	carrying	out	surgery	,	and	treating	cancer	patients	,	drug	addicts	and	pregnant	women	.
Earlier	this	month	,	the	Supreme	Soviet	adopted	two	more	resolutions	restricting	the	freedom	of	cooperatives	:	The	first	enables	the	soviets	to	set	prices	for	which	goods	may	be	sold	*-1	*T*-2	;	the	second	bans	cooperatives	from	*-3	buying	``	industrial	and	food	goods	''	from	the	state	or	other	cooperatives	.
If	Mr.	Gorbachev	is	looking	toward	*-1	unleashing	the	productive	forces	of	the	market	,	these	latest	resolutions	are	nothing	short	of	reckless	.
Along	with	some	other	revealing	indicators	,	these	developments	suggest	that	while	Mr.	Gorbachev	wishes	*-2	to	move	away	from	some	rigid	central	controls	,	he	is	bent	on	*-3	creating	economic	structures	of	a	kind	that	*T*-1	would	scarcely	find	favor	with	the	Austrian	or	Chicago	schools	of	economic	thought	.
Mr.	Gorbachev	has	ruled	out	the	use	of	the	market	*	to	solve	the	problem	of	insufficient	consumer	goods	.
He	told	the	Congress	of	People	's	Deputies	on	May	30	:	``	We	do	not	share	this	approach	,	since	it	would	immediately	destroy	the	social	situation	and	disrupt	all	the	processes	in	the	country	.	''
*-4	Having	rejected	central	economic	planning	for	economic	reasons	,	and	the	market	for	fear	of	the	social	-LRB-	political	-RRB-	consequences	,	Mr.	Gorbachev	seeks	a	``	third	way	''	that	*T*-1	would	combine	the	discipline	and	controls	of	the	former	with	the	economic	benefits	of	the	latter	.
Most	important	,	this	would	leave	the	party	intact	and	its	monopoly	of	political	power	largely	undisturbed	.
Indeed	,	Mr.	Gorbachev	's	proposals	display	a	close	conceptual	resemblance	to	the	tenets	of	Italian	fascism	,	whose	architects	*T*-1	spoke	specifically	of	a	``	third	way	''	:	of	*	having	produced	a	historic	synthesis	of	socialism	and	capitalism	.
They	,	too	,	promised	*-1	to	combine	economic	efficiency	with	order	and	discipline	.
The	emergence	of	Russian	corporatism	had	been	anticipated	*-1	in	journalist	George	Urban	's	introduction	to	a	series	of	colloquies	--	``	Can	the	Soviet	System	Survive	Reform	?	''	--	published	*	this	spring	.
``	Communism	will	reach	its	final	stage	of	development	in	a	feckless	Russo	--	corporation-socialist	in	form	,	nationalistic	in	content	and	Oriental	in	style	--	that	*T*-1	will	puzzle	the	world	with	*	alternating	feats	of	realism	and	recklessness	...	.	''
The	fascist	concept	of	corporatism	envisaged	an	``	organic	''	society	in	which	citizens	were	spiritually	and	morally	unified	,	and	prepared	*-2	to	sacrifice	themselves	for	the	nation	*T*-1	.
This	unification	was	*-2	to	be	brought	about	through	policies	and	institutions	that	*T*-1	would	unite	workers	and	employers	with	government	in	a	fully	integrated	and	``	harmonic	''	society	.
The	key	to	the	creation	of	the	``	organic	''	state	lay	in	the	formation	of	``	natural	''	groups	that	*T*-1	would	undertake	the	role	of	decision-making	.
By	contrast	,	a	parliamentary	system	based	*	on	abstract	political	rights	and	groups	was	held	*-2	to	cause	*RNR*-1	,	rather	than	resolve	*RNR*-1	,	conflict	.
The	closeness	of	Soviet	perestroika	to	the	fascist	social	blueprint	of	Mussolini	was	evident	when	Mr.	Gorbachev	presented	his	economic	vision	to	the	Soviet	Congress	*T*-1	.
In	*-1	doing	so	,	he	neither	rejected	a	socialist	planned	economy	nor	embraced	the	free	market	.
Instead	,	he	proposed	a	``	law-governed	economy	,	''	in	which	there	would	be	a	``	clear-cut	division	between	state	direction	of	the	economy	and	economic	management	*T*-1	.	''
The	latter	would	be	undertaken	*-1	by	``	enterprises	,	joint	stock	companies	and	cooperatives	.	''
These	would	not	function	independently	,	but	would	act	together	*-2	to	form	``	combines	,	unions	and	associations	''	0	*T*-1	to	tackle	problems	and	coordinate	their	activities	.
Mr.	Gorbachev	is	in	a	much	stronger	position	0	*	to	pursue	the	corporatist	ideal	*T*-2	than	was	Mussolini	,	who	*T*-1	was	never	able	*-3	to	influence	business	giants	such	as	Pirelli	and	Fiat	*?*	.
The	Soviet	Communist	Party	has	the	power	*	to	shape	corporate	development	and	mold	it	into	a	body	dependent	upon	it	.
*-2	To	ensure	the	loyalty	of	the	business	sector	,	Mr.	Gorbachev	may	offer	concessions	and	powers	that	*T*-1	will	allow	the	business	community	to	preserve	its	own	interests	,	probably	by	*	restricting	competition	.
However	,	Mr.	Gorbachev	must	ensure	that	within	this	``	alliance	''	the	business	sector	remains	subordinate	to	the	party	.
At	the	same	time	,	he	must	give	it	sufficient	freedom	0	*	to	provide	the	economic	benefits	so	desperately	needed	*	*T*-1	.
It	is	the	promise	of	economic	returns	that	*T*-3	is	supposed	*-2	to	make	the	corporatist	model	attractive	to	both	the	party	and	labor	.
The	work	force	provides	the	third	arm	of	the	``	alliance	.	''
Within	the	alliance	it	is	supposed	*-3	to	act	as	a	balancing	force	,	*-3	guarding	against	excessive	control	by	government	or	abuse	of	its	economic	position	by	business	,	for	either	could	result	in	a	deterioration	of	its	living	standards	-LRB-	under	the	new	resolutions	,	workers	councils	may	demand	that	a	cooperative	be	closed	*-1	or	its	prices	be	reduced	*-2	-RRB-	.
By	*-3	providing	workers	with	the	opportunity	*	to	move	into	the	private	sector	where	wages	tend	*-2	to	be	higher	*T*-1	,	and	by	*-3	holding	out	the	promise	of	more	consumer	goods	,	Mr.	Gorbachev	hopes	*-3	to	revive	the	popularity	of	the	party	.
At	the	same	time	,	the	strategy	requires	that	he	deal	effectively	with	those	who	*T*-1	seek	genuine	Western-style	political	pluralism	.
The	most	important	development	in	Mr.	Gorbachev	's	policy	for	*	marginalizing	the	opposition	movement	is	the	claim	that	the	U.S.S.R.	also	suffers	from	terrorism	.
An	increasing	number	of	references	by	the	Soviet	press	to	opposition	groups	now	active	in	the	U.S.S.R.	,	particularly	the	Democratic	Union	,	allege	that	they	show	``	terroristic	tendencies	''	and	claim	that	they	would	be	prepared	*-1	to	kill	in	order	*-2	to	achieve	their	aims	.
It	*EXP*-2	is	possible	that	,	in	*	perpetuating	such	myths	,	the	ground	is	being	laid	*-3	for	the	arrest	of	opposition	activists	on	the	ground	of	terrorism	.
Mr.	Gorbachev	would	appear	*-1	to	see	his	central	task	,	however	,	as	that	of	*	ensuring	that	foundations	of	an	alliance	among	labor	,	capital	and	the	state	are	properly	laid	before	the	demands	for	a	multiparty	system	reach	a	crescendo	.
If	he	were	able	*-1	to	construct	a	popular	and	efficient	corporatist	system	,	he	or	his	heir	would	be	wellplaced	*-2	to	rein	in	political	opposition	,	and	to	re-establish	control	in	Eastern	Europe	.
The	weaknesses	in	his	plan	do	not	lie	in	the	political	calculations	--	Mr.	Gorbachev	is	a	consummate	political	leader	,	perhaps	one	of	the	greatest	--	but	in	its	economic	prescription	.
Contrary	to	widespread	belief	,	Mussolini	failed	*-3	to	live	up	to	his	promise	*	to	make	the	trains	run	on	time	;	it	*EXP*-1	is	doubtful	whether	Soviet-style	corporatism	will	make	Soviet	trains	run	on	time	,	or	fill	the	shops	with	goods	that	the	consumers	so	desperately	crave	*T*-2	.

New	construction	contracting	climbed	8	%	in	September	to	an	annualized	$	274.2	billion	*U*	,	with	commercial	,	industrial	and	public-works	contracts	providing	most	of	the	increase	,	according	to	F.W.	Dodge	Group	.
Through	the	first	nine	months	of	the	year	,	the	unadjusted	total	of	all	new	construction	was	$	199.6	billion	*U*	,	flat	compared	with	a	year	earlier	.
The	South	was	off	2	%	after	the	first	nine	months	,	while	the	North	Central	region	was	up	3	%	.
The	Northeast	and	West	regions	were	unchanged	.
A	small	decline	in	total	construction	for	the	entire	year	is	possible	if	contracting	for	housing	does	n't	increase	in	response	to	this	year	's	lower	mortgage	rates	,	said	0	*T*-1	George	A.	Christie	,	vice	president	and	chief	economist	of	Dodge	,	the	forecasting	division	of	publisher	McGraw-Hill	Inc	.
The	seasonally	adjusted	Dodge	Index	reached	175	in	September	,	its	highest	level	this	year	,	from	162	in	August	.

Newly	contracted	residential	work	edged	up	2	%	in	September	to	an	annualized	$	121.2	billion	*U*	,	largely	because	multifamily	building	rebounded	from	a	very	weak	August	.
``	At	the	end	of	the	third	quarter	,	there	was	still	no	evidence	of	renewed	home	building	in	response	to	the	midyear	decline	of	mortgage	rates	,	''	Mr.	Christie	said	*T*-1	.
Housing	has	been	weak	all	year	and	especially	so	in	the	past	five	months	.
Contracting	for	non-residential	buildings	rose	10	%	in	September	to	an	annualized	$	100.8	billion	*U*	.
Commercial	and	industrial	construction	rose	sharply	,	partly	because	of	three	large	projects	,	each	expected	*	to	cost	more	than	$	100	million	*U*	.
Institutional	building	,	such	as	hospitals	and	schools	,	eased	in	September	following	a	surge	in	August	.
Although	the	third	quarter	was	the	best	*ICH*-1	so	far	this	year	for	non-residential	building	,	weakness	early	in	the	year	held	the	nine-month	total	to	$	69.6	billion	*U*	,	up	just	1	%	from	a	year	earlier	.
Public-works	and	utility	projects	,	also	known	*	as	non-building	contracting	,	grew	18	%	to	$	52.2	billion	*U*	in	September	,	but	the	nine-month	total	of	$	36.9	billion	*U*	was	down	3	%	from	a	year	earlier	.
The	Sept.	30	end	of	the	federal	fiscal	year	may	have	prodded	contractors	to	get	any	behind-schedule	road	and	bridge	construction	under	way	``	before	the	clock	ran	out	,	''	Mr.	Christie	said	0	*T*-1	,	*-2	referring	to	threatened	5	%	across-the-board	budget	cuts	.

Moody	's	Investors	Service	Inc.	said	0	it	lowered	ratings	on	long-term	debt	of	CS	First	Boston	Inc.	,	the	holding	company	of	Wall	Street	giant	First	Boston	Corp.	,	because	of	First	Boston	's	``	aggressive	merchant	banking	risk	''	in	highly	leveraged	takeovers	.

First	Boston	's	merchant	banking	risks	mounted	last	month	as	highly	leveraged	Campeau	Corp.	,	First	Boston	's	most	lucrative	client	of	the	decade	,	was	hit	*-4	by	a	cash	squeeze	and	the	high-risk	junk	bond	market	tumbled	.

The	Oakland	Athletics	'	four-game	sweep	over	the	San	Francisco	Giants	in	the	World	Series	may	widen	already-sizable	losses	that	the	ABC	network	will	incur	*T*-1	on	the	current	,	final	year	of	its	baseball	contract	.
The	1989	Series	,	disrupted	*	by	a	devastating	earthquake	and	diminished	*	in	national	interest	because	both	teams	came	from	the	San	Francisco	Bay	area	,	is	likely	*-2	to	end	up	as	the	lowest-rated	Series	of	this	decade	and	probably	since	the	event	has	been	broadcast	*-1	.
The	first	three	games	were	seen	*-1	by	an	average	of	only	17	%	of	U.S.	homes	,	a	sharp	decline	from	the	23.7	%	rating	for	last	year	's	Series	.
A	final	ratings	tally	from	A.C.	Nielsen	Co.	is	due	today	.
The	sweep	by	the	A's	,	whose	pitchers	and	home-run	hitters	*T*-1	dominated	the	injury-prone	Giants	,	will	only	make	things	worse	for	ABC	,	owned	*	by	Capital	Cities\/ABC	Inc	.
The	network	had	been	expected	*-1	to	have	losses	of	as	much	as	$	20	million	*U*	on	baseball	this	year	.
It	*EXP*-2	is	n't	clear	how	much	those	losses	may	widen	*T*-1	because	of	the	short	Series	.
Had	the	contest	gone	a	full	seven	games	,	ABC	could	have	reaped	an	extra	$	10	million	*U*	in	ad	sales	on	the	seventh	game	alone	,	compared	with	the	ad	take	0	it	would	have	received	*T*-1	for	regular	prime-time	shows	.
ABC	had	based	its	budget	for	baseball	on	a	six-game	Series	.
A	network	spokesman	would	n't	comment	,	and	ABC	Sports	officials	declined	*-2	to	be	interviewed	*-1	.
But	some	industry	executives	said	0	ABC	,	in	anticipation	of	a	four-game	sweep	,	limited	its	losses	by	*-2	jacking	up	the	number	of	commercials	0	it	aired	*T*-1	in	the	third	and	fourth	games	.
A	World	Series	telecast	typically	carries	56	30-second	commercials	,	but	by	the	fourth	game	ABC	was	cramming	in	60	to	62	ads	*-1	to	generate	extra	revenue	.
ABC	's	baseball	experience	may	be	of	interest	to	CBS	Inc.	,	which	*T*-1	next	season	takes	over	the	broadcasting	of	all	baseball	playoffs	in	a	four-year	television	contract	priced	*	at	$	1.06	billion	*U*	.
CBS	Sports	President	Neal	Pilson	has	conceded	only	that	CBS	will	have	a	loss	in	the	first	year	.
But	other	industry	executives	contend	0	the	losses	could	reach	$	250	million	*U*	over	four	years	and	could	go	even	higher	if	the	World	Series	end	in	four-game	romps	.
The	Series	typically	is	among	the	highest-rated	sports	events	on	television	.
Last	year	's	series	,	broadcast	*	by	General	Electric	Co.	's	NBC	,	was	the	lowest-rated	Series	in	four	years	;	instead	of	*	featuring	a	major	East	Coast	team	against	a	West	Coast	team	,	it	pitted	the	Los	Angeles	Dodgers	against	the	losing	Oakland	A's	.
ABC	's	hurdle	was	even	higher	this	year	with	two	teams	from	the	same	area	.
The	Series	got	off	to	a	lukewarm	start	Oct.	14	with	a	16.2	%	rating	;	the	next	night	it	drew	17.4	%	of	homes	.
Then	came	the	earthquake	and	a	damaging	delay	of	11	days	.
Some	people	had	hoped	0	ABC	's	ratings	would	go	up	because	of	the	intense	focus	on	the	event	in	the	aftermath	of	the	earthquake	.
An	analyst	's	opinion	to	that	effect	even	sent	Capital	Cities\/ABC	shares	soaring	two	weeks	ago	.
But	interest	instead	decreased	.
The	third	game	,	last	Friday	night	,	drew	a	disappointing	17.5	rating	.
Bargain	hunters	helped	stock	prices	break	a	weeklong	losing	streak	while	bond	prices	and	the	dollar	inched	higher	.
The	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	gained	6.76	points	to	2603.48	in	light	trading	after	*-1	losing	more	than	92	points	last	week	.
Bond	prices	continued	*-1	to	edge	higher	in	anticipation	of	more	news	showing	a	slower	economy	.
Although	the	dollar	rose	slightly	against	most	major	currencies	,	the	focus	in	currency	markets	was	on	the	beleaguered	British	pound	,	which	*T*-1	gained	slightly	against	the	dollar	.
Trading	volume	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	dwindled	to	only	126.6	million	shares	yesterday	as	major	brokerage	firms	continued	*-1	to	throw	in	the	towel	on	program	trading	.
Kidder	Peabody	became	the	most	recent	firm	0	*T*-1	to	swear	off	stock-index	arbitrage	trading	for	its	own	account	,	and	Merrill	Lynch	late	yesterday	took	the	major	step	of	*	renouncing	the	trading	strategy	even	for	its	clients	.
Yet	that	did	n't	eliminate	program	trading	from	the	market	.
The	Dow	industrials	shot	up	23	points	in	the	opening	hour	,	at	least	in	part	because	of	buy	programs	generated	*	by	stock-index	arbitrage	,	a	form	of	program	trading	involving	futures	contracts	.
But	interest	waned	as	the	day	wore	on	and	investors	looked	ahead	to	the	release	later	this	week	of	two	important	economic	reports	.
The	first	is	Wednesday	's	survey	of	purchasing	managers	,	considered	a	good	indicator	of	how	the	nation	's	manufacturing	sector	fared	in	October	*T*-1	.
The	other	is	Friday	's	measure	of	October	employment	,	an	indicator	of	the	broader	economy	's	health	.
Both	are	expected	*-2	to	show	continued	sluggishness	,	which	*T*-1	would	be	good	for	bonds	and	bad	for	stocks	.
In	major	market	activity	:	Stock	prices	rose	in	light	trading	.
But	declining	issues	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	outnumbered	gainers	774	to	684	,	and	broader	market	indexes	were	virtually	unchanged	.
Bond	prices	crept	higher	.
The	Treasury	's	benchmark	30-year	bond	gained	about	an	eighth	of	a	point	,	or	about	$	1.25	*U*	for	each	$	1,000	*U*	face	amount	.
The	yield	on	the	issue	slipped	to	7.92	%	.
The	dollar	gained	.
In	late	New	York	trading	the	dollar	was	quoted	*-1	at	1.8340	marks	and	141.90	yen	,	compared	with	1.8300	marks	and	141.65	yen	Friday	.
The	British	pound	,	*-1	pressured	*	by	last	week	's	resignations	of	key	Thatcher	administration	officials	,	nevertheless	rose	Monday	to	$	1.5820	*U*	from	Friday	's	$	1.5795	*U*	.
If	Japanese	companies	are	so	efficient	,	why	does	Kawasaki-Rikuso	Transportation	Co.	sometimes	need	a	week	just	*-3	to	tell	its	clients	how	soon	it	can	ship	goods	from	here	to	Osaka	*T*-1	*T*-2	?
Why	,	until	last	spring	,	did	the	Long-Term	Credit	Bank	of	Japan	sometimes	take	several	days	*-2	to	correct	typographical	errors	in	its	paper	work	for	international	transactions	*T*-1	?
Because	the	companies	have	lacked	office	computers	considered	*	standard	equipment	in	the	U.S.	and	Western	Europe	,	Japanese	corporations	'	reputation	as	hi-tech	powerhouses	is	only	half	right	.
Their	factories	may	look	like	sets	for	a	Spielberg	movie	,	but	their	offices	,	with	rows	of	clerks	hunched	*	over	ledgers	and	abacuses	,	are	more	like	scenes	from	a	Dickens	novel	.
Now	,	the	personal-computer	revolution	is	finally	reaching	Japan	.
Kawasaki-Rikuso	,	a	freight	company	,	set	up	its	own	software	subsidiary	this	year	and	is	spending	nearly	a	year	's	profit	*-1	to	more	than	double	the	computer	terminals	at	its	main	office	.
In	April	,	the	Long-Term	Credit	Bank	linked	its	computers	in	Tokyo	with	its	three	American	offices	.
Overall	,	PC	sales	in	Japan	in	the	first	half	of	1989	were	34	%	higher	than	in	the	year-earlier	period	.
Combined	PC	and	work-station	use	in	Japan	will	jump	as	much	as	25	%	annually	over	the	next	five	years	,	according	to	some	analysts	,	compared	with	about	10	%	in	the	U.S.	.
And	with	a	labor	shortage	and	intense	competitive	pressure	*	to	improve	efficiency	,	more	and	more	Japanese	companies	are	concluding	that	they	have	no	choice	.
``	We	have	too	many	people	in	our	home	offices	,	''	says	*T*-1	Yoshio	Hatakeyama	,	the	president	of	the	Japan	Management	Association	.
``	Productivity	in	Japanese	offices	is	relatively	low	.	''
With	Japanese	companies	in	a	wide	range	of	industries	--	from	heavy	industry	to	securities	firms	--	increasing	their	market	share	world-wide	,	the	prospect	of	an	even	more	efficient	Japanese	economic	army	may	rattle	foreigners	.
But	it	also	offers	opportunities	;	Americans	are	well	poised	*-1	to	supply	the	weapons	.
Japan	may	be	a	tough	market	0	for	outsiders	to	penetrate	*T*-1	,	and	the	U.S.	is	hopelessly	behind	Japan	in	certain	technologies	.
But	for	now	,	at	least	,	Americans	are	far	better	at	*	making	PCs	and	the	software	that	*T*-1	runs	them	.
After	years	of	*	talking	about	*	selling	in	Japan	,	more	and	more	U.S.	companies	are	seriously	pouring	in	.
Apple	Computer	Inc.	has	doubled	its	staff	here	over	the	past	year	.
Lotus	Development	Corp.	has	slashed	the	lag	between	U.S.	and	Japan	product	introductions	to	six	months	from	three	years	.
Ungermann-Bass	Inc.	has	a	bigger	share	of	the	computer-network	market	in	Japan	than	at	home	.
But	the	Japanese	have	*-1	to	go	a	long	way	*-2	to	catch	up	.
Typical	is	*T*-1	one	office	of	the	Ministry	of	International	Trade	and	Industry	's	Machinery	and	Information	Industries	Bureau	--	the	main	bureaucracy	overseeing	the	computer	industry	.
``	Personal	Computer	''	yearbooks	are	lined	up	on	nearly	every	desk	,	and	dog-eared	copies	of	Nikkei	Computer	crowd	magazine	racks	.
But	amid	the	two	dozen	bureaucrats	and	secretaries	sits	*T*-1	only	one	real-life	PC	.
While	American	PC	sales	have	averaged	roughly	25	%	annual	growth	since	1984	and	West	European	sales	a	whopping	40	%	,	Japanese	sales	were	flat	for	most	of	that	time	.
Japanese	office	workers	use	PCs	at	half	the	rate	of	their	European	counterparts	and	one-third	that	of	the	Americans	.
Moreover	,	Japanese	offices	tend	*-1	to	use	computers	less	efficiently	than	American	offices	do	*?*	.
In	the	U.S.	,	PCs	commonly	perform	many	tasks	and	plug	into	a	broad	network	.
In	Japan	,	many	desktop	terminals	are	limited	to	one	function	and	ca	n't	communicate	with	other	machines	.
The	market	planning	and	sales	promotion	office	of	Nomura	Securities	Co.	,	for	example	,	has	more	than	30	computers	for	its	60	workers	,	a	respectable	ratio	.
But	the	machines	are	n't	on	employees	'	desks	;	they	ring	the	perimeter	of	the	large	office	.
Some	machines	make	charts	for	presentations	.
Others	analyze	the	data	.
*-1	To	transfer	information	from	one	to	the	other	,	employees	make	printouts	and	enter	the	data	manually	.
*-1	To	transmit	charts	to	branch	offices	,	they	use	a	fax	machine	.
Meanwhile	,	a	woman	sitting	next	to	a	new	Fujitsu	terminal	writes	stock-market	information	on	a	chart	with	a	pencil	and	adds	it	up	with	a	hand	calculator	.
In	an	efficient	setup	,	the	same	PC	could	perform	all	those	tasks	.
In	the	U.S.	,	more	than	half	the	PC	software	sold	*	is	either	for	spreadsheets	or	for	database	analysis	,	according	to	Lotus	.
In	Japan	,	those	functions	account	for	only	about	a	third	of	the	software	market	.
Machines	dedicated	*	solely	to	word	processing	,	which	*T*-1	have	all	but	disappeared	in	the	U.S.	,	are	still	more	common	*ICH*-2	in	Japan	than	PCs	.
In	the	U.S.	,	one-fifth	of	the	office	PCs	are	hooked	up	to	some	sort	of	network	.
In	Japan	,	about	1	%	are	linked	*-1	.
``	Computers	here	are	used	*-3	for	data	gathering	,	''	says	*T*-2	Roger	J.	Boisvert	,	who	*T*-1	manages	the	integrated-technologies	group	in	McKinsey	&	Co.	's	Tokyo	office	.
Some	Japanese	operations	,	such	as	securities-trading	rooms	,	may	be	ahead	of	their	American	counterparts	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	,	but	``	basically	,	there	's	little	analysis	done	*	on	computers	in	Japan	.	''
Of	course	,	*	simply	buying	computers	does	n't	always	solve	problems	,	and	many	American	companies	have	erred	by	*-2	purchasing	technology	0	they	did	n't	understand	*T*-1	.
But	healthy	skepticism	is	only	a	small	reason	for	Japan	's	PC	lag	.
Various	cultural	and	economic	forces	have	suppressed	demand	.
Because	the	Japanese	``	alphabet	''	is	so	huge	,	Japan	has	no	history	of	typewriter	use	,	and	so	``	keyboard	allergy	,	''	especially	among	older	workers	,	remains	a	common	affliction	.
``	I	have	no	experience	before	with	such	sophisticated	machinery	,	''	says	*T*-1	Matsuo	Toshimitsu	,	a	66-year-old	executive	vice	president	of	Japan	Air	Lines	,	*-2	explaining	his	reluctance	before	*	accepting	a	terminal	in	his	office	this	summer	.
While	most	American	employees	have	their	own	private	space	,	Japanese	``	salarymen	''	usually	share	large	,	common	tables	and	rely	heavily	on	old-fashioned	personal	contact	.
Top	Japanese	executives	often	make	decisions	based	*	on	consensus	and	personal	relationships	rather	than	complex	financial	projections	and	fancy	presentations	.
And	Japan	's	management	system	makes	it	*EXP*-1	hard	*	to	impose	a	single	,	integrated	computer	system	corporatewide	.
Besides	,	a	computer	processing	the	Japanese	language	needs	a	huge	memory	and	much	processing	capability	,	while	the	screen	and	printer	need	far	better	definition	*-1	to	depict	accurately	the	intricate	symbols	.
Until	recently	,	much	of	the	necessary	technology	has	been	unavailable	or	at	least	unaffordable	.
Some	analysts	estimate	0	the	average	PC	costs	about	50	%	more	*ICH*-2	in	Japan	than	the	U.S.	.
But	the	complex	language	is	n't	the	only	reason	.
For	the	past	decade	,	NEC	Corp.	has	owned	more	than	half	the	Japanese	PC	market	and	ruled	it	with	near-monopoly	power	.
With	little	competition	,	the	computer	industry	here	is	inefficient	.
The	U.S.	market	,	too	,	is	dominated	*-1	by	a	giant	,	International	Business	Machines	Corp	.
But	early	on	,	IBM	offered	its	basic	design	to	anybody	wanting	*	to	copy	it	.
Dozens	of	small	companies	did	,	*-1	swiftly	establishing	a	standard	operating	system	.
That	spurs	competition	and	growth	,	allows	users	to	change	and	mix	brands	easily	,	and	increases	software	firms	'	incentive	*	to	write	packages	because	they	can	be	sold	*-1	to	users	of	virtually	any	computer	.
If	a	record	industry	lacked	a	common	standard	,	Sony	CD	owners	could	listen	to	a	Sony	version	of	Madonna	's	``	Like	a	Prayer	''	but	not	one	made	*	for	a	Panasonic	player	.
That	is	the	state	of	Japan	's	computer	industry	.
NEC	wo	n't	release	its	code	,	and	every	one	of	the	dozen	or	so	makers	has	its	own	proprietary	operating	system	--	all	incompatible	with	each	other	.
IBM	established	its	standard	*-4	to	try	*-1	to	stop	*-3	falling	behind	upstart	Apple	Computer	,	but	NEC	was	ahead	from	the	start	and	did	n't	need	*-2	to	invite	in	competitive	allies	.
Meanwhile	,	the	big	players	have	n't	tried	*-1	to	copy	the	NEC	standard	.
Corporate	pride	as	well	as	the	close	ties	common	among	Japanese	manufacturers	help	*-1	explain	why	.
Most	rivals	``	have	a	working	relationship	with	NEC	,	often	through	cross-licensing	of	technology	,	''	the	Japan	Personal	Computer	Software	Association	noted	0	*T*-1	recently	.
``	They	hesitate	*-1	to	market	NEC-compatible	machines	;	NEC	disapproves	of	such	machines	,	and	*	marketing	one	would	jeopardize	their	relationship	.	''
The	result	,	according	to	many	analysts	,	is	higher	prices	and	less	innovation	.
While	tens	of	thousands	of	software	packages	using	the	IBM	standard	are	available	in	the	U.S.	,	they	say	0	only	about	8,000	are	written	*-1	for	NEC	.
A	year	ago	,	Japan	's	Fair	Trade	Commission	warned	NEC	about	possible	violations	of	anti-monopoly	laws	for	*	discouraging	retailers	from	*-1	discounting	.
In	Japan	,	``	software	is	four	to	five	years	behind	the	U.S.	because	hardware	is	four	to	five	years	behind	,	because	NEC	is	enjoying	a	monopoly	,	''	complains	0	*T*-1	Kazuhiko	Nishi	,	the	president	of	Ascii	Corp.	,	one	of	Japan	's	leading	PC-magazine	publishing	and	software	companies	.
``	There	are	no	price	wars	,	no	competition	.	''
An	NEC	spokeswoman	responds	that	prices	are	higher	in	Japan	because	customers	put	a	greater	emphasis	*ICH*-1	on	quality	and	service	than	they	do	*?*	in	the	U.S.	.
She	adds	that	some	technological	advances	trail	those	in	the	U.S.	because	the	Japanese	still	import	basic	operating	systems	from	American	companies	.
But	the	market	is	changing	.
The	government	is	funding	several	projects	*	to	push	PC	use	.
Over	the	next	three	years	,	public	schools	will	get	1.5	million	PCs	,	a	15-fold	increase	from	current	levels	.
In	the	private	sector	,	practically	every	major	company	is	setting	explicit	goals	*	to	increase	employees	'	exposure	to	computers	.
Toyota	Motor	Corp.	's	sales	offices	in	Japan	have	one-tenth	the	computers	per	employee	that	its	own	U.S.	offices	do	*?*	*T*-1	;	over	the	next	five	years	,	it	is	aiming	for	rough	parity	.
Within	a	year	,	Kao	Corp.	,	a	major	cosmetics	company	,	plans	*-1	to	eliminate	1,000	clerical	jobs	by	*-1	putting	on	a	central	computer	network	some	work	,	such	as	credit	reports	,	currently	performed	*	in	22	separate	offices	.
By	*-3	increasing	the	number	of	PCs	0	it	uses	*T*-2	from	66	to	1,000	,	Omron	Tateishi	Electronics	Co.	,	of	Kyoto	,	hopes	*-3	not	only	to	make	certain	tasks	easier	but	also	to	transform	the	way	0	the	company	is	run	*-1	*T*-4	.
``	Managers	have	long	been	those	who	*T*-1	supervise	their	subordinates	so	orders	would	be	properly	acted	on	*-3	,	''	a	spokesman	says	*T*-2	.
``	But	new	managers	will	have	*-1	to	be	creators	and	innovators	...	and	for	that	purpose	it	*EXP*-2	is	necessary	*	to	create	an	environment	where	information	from	both	inside	and	outside	the	company	can	be	reached	*-4	easily	,	and	also	shared	*-4	*T*-3	.	''
Meanwhile	,	more	computer	makers	now	are	competing	for	the	new	business	.
Seiko	Epson	Corp.	,	a	newcomer	to	the	industry	,	fought	off	a	legal	challenge	and	started	selling	NEC	clones	last	year	.
It	has	won	about	15	%	of	the	retail	PC	market	.
Sony	Corp.	,	which	*T*-1	temporarily	dropped	out	of	the	PC	business	three	years	ago	,	started	selling	its	work	station	in	1987	and	quickly	became	the	leading	Japanese	company	in	that	market	.
In	a	country	where	elbow	room	is	scarce	*T*-1	,	laptop	machines	will	take	a	large	portion	of	the	industry	's	future	growth	.
Toshiba	Corp.	busted	*-2	open	that	sector	this	summer	with	a	notebook-sized	machine	that	*T*-1	retails	for	less	than	200,000	yen	-LRB-	under	$	1,500	*U*	-RRB-	--	one	of	the	smallest	,	cheapest	PCs	available	in	the	country	.
Fujitsu	Ltd.	is	lavishing	the	most	expensive	promotion	campaign	in	its	history	--	including	a	100,000-guest	bash	at	Tokyo	Dome	--	for	its	sophisticated	sound\/graphics	FM	Towns	machine	,	which	it	advertises	*T*-1	for	everything	from	*	balancing	the	family	checkbook	to	*	practicing	karaoke	,	bar	singing	.
Many	of	the	companies	are	even	dropping	their	traditional	independence	and	trying	*-1	to	band	together	*-1	to	create	some	sort	of	standard	.
Two	years	ago	,	most	of	the	smaller	makers	joined	under	the	Microsoft	Corp.	umbrella	*-1	to	adopt	a	version	of	the	American	IBM	AT	standard	.
That	has	n't	generated	much	sales	,	but	this	summer	Microsoft	rallied	all	the	major	NEC	competitors	to	make	their	new	machines	compatible	with	the	IBM	OS\/2	standard	.
A	healthy	,	coherent	Japanese	market	could	also	make	it	*EXP*-2	far	easier	for	Japanese	companies	to	sell	overseas	,	where	their	share	is	still	minimal	*T*-1	.
But	it	could	also	help	American	companies	,	which	*T*-1	also	are	starting	*-2	to	try	*-3	to	open	the	market	.
As	with	many	other	goods	,	the	American	share	of	Japan	's	PC	market	is	far	below	that	in	the	rest	of	the	world	.
U.S.	makers	have	under	10	%	share	,	compared	with	half	the	market	in	Europe	and	80	%	at	home	.
Though	no	formal	trade	barriers	exist	,	the	Japanese	computer	industry	is	difficult	0	for	outsiders	to	enter	*T*-1	.
``	If	it	were	an	open	market	,	we	would	have	been	in	in	1983	or	1984	,	''	says	*T*-2	Eckhard	Pfeiffer	,	who	*T*-1	heads	Compaq	Computer	Corp.	's	European	and	international	operations	.
His	company	,	without	any	major	effort	,	sells	more	machines	in	China	than	in	Japan	.
Although	it	has	opened	a	New	Zealand	subsidiary	,	it	is	still	only	``	studying	''	Japan	,	the	only	nation	that	*T*-1	has	n't	adopted	IBM-oriented	specifications	.
And	because	general	retail	centers	such	as	ComputerLand	have	little	presence	in	Japan	,	sales	remain	in	the	iron	grip	of	established	computer	makers	.
But	the	Americans	are	also	*-1	to	blame	.
They	long	made	little	effort	here	.
IBM	,	though	*-1	long	a	leader	in	the	Japanese	mainframe	business	,	did	n't	introduce	its	first	PC	in	Japan	until	five	years	after	NEC	did	*?*	,	and	that	was	n't	compatible	even	with	the	U.S.	IBM	standard	.
Apple	did	n't	introduce	a	kanji	machine	--	one	that	*T*-1	handles	the	Chinese	characters	of	written	Japanese	--	until	three	years	after	*	entering	the	market	.
Critics	also	say	0	American	companies	charge	too	much	.
Japan	's	FTC	says	0	it	is	investigating	Apple	for	*-1	allegedly	discouraging	retailers	from	*-2	discounting	.
But	the	U.S.	companies	are	redoubling	their	efforts	.
Apple	recently	hired	its	first	Japanese	president	*ICH*-2	,	*-1	luring	away	an	official	of	Toshiba	's	European	operations	,	as	well	as	a	whole	Japanese	top-management	team	.
Earlier	this	year	,	it	introduced	a	much	more	powerful	kanji	operating	system	and	a	kanji	laser	printer	.
IBM	just	last	year	started	*-3	selling	its	first	machine	that	*T*-1	could	run	in	both	Japanese	and	English	and	that	*T*-2	substantially	enhances	compatibility	with	its	American	products	.
``	It	*EXP*-2	may	take	five	years	*	to	break	even	in	Japan	,	''	says	*T*-3	John	A.	Siniscal	,	who	*T*-1	runs	the	Asia-Pacific	office	for	McCormack	&	Dodge	,	a	U.S.	software	company	.
``	But	it	's	an	enormous	business	opportunity	.
From	a	reading	of	the	somewhat	scant	English-language	medical	literature	on	RU-486	,	the	French	abortion	pill	emerges	as	one	of	the	creepiest	concoctions	around	.
This	is	not	only	because	it	kills	the	unborn	,	a	job	at	which	it	actually	is	not	outstandingly	efficient	*T*-2	,	*-3	zapping	only	50	%	to	85	%	*U*	of	them	depending	on	which	study	you	read	*T*-1	-LRB-	prostaglandin	,	*-4	taken	*	in	conjunction	with	the	pill	,	boosts	the	rate	to	95	%	-RRB-	.
By	contrast	,	surgical	abortion	is	99	%	effective	.
Abortion	via	the	pill	is	far	more	of	an	ordeal	than	conventional	surgical	abortion	.
It	is	time-consuming	-LRB-	the	abortion	part	alone	lasts	three	days	,	and	the	clinical	part	comprises	a	week	's	worth	of	visits	-RRB-	,	bloody	-LRB-	one	woman	in	a	Swedish	trial	required	a	transfusion	,	although	for	most	it	resembles	a	menstrual	period	,	with	bleeding	lasting	an	average	of	10	days	-RRB-	,	and	painful	-LRB-	many	women	require	analgesic	shots	*-1	to	ease	them	through	-RRB-	.
Nausea	and	vomiting	are	other	common	side	effects	.
Timing	is	of	the	essence	with	RU-486	.
It	is	most	effective	*-2	taken	*-3	about	a	week	after	a	woman	misses	her	menstrual	period	up	through	the	seventh	week	of	pregnancy	,	when	it	is	markedly	less	effective	*T*-1	.
That	is	typically	about	a	three-week	window	.
So	far	,	all	the	studies	have	concluded	that	RU-486	is	``	safe	.	''
But	``	safe	,	''	in	the	definition	of	Marie	Bass	of	the	Reproductive	Health	Technologies	Project	,	means	0	``	there	's	been	no	evidence	*ICH*-1	so	far	of	mortality	.	''
No	one	has	researched	the	long-term	effects	of	RU-486	on	a	woman	's	health	or	fertility	.
The	drug	seems	*-2	to	suppress	ovulation	for	three	to	seven	months	after	it	is	taken	*-1	.
Some	women	clearly	have	no	trouble	*	eventually	conceiving	again	:	The	studies	have	reported	repeaters	in	their	programs	.
But	there	are	no	scientific	data	on	this	question	.
Rather	ominously	,	rabbit	studies	reveal	that	RU-486	can	cause	birth	defects	,	Lancet	,	the	British	medical	journal	,	reported	0	*T*-1	in	1987	.
However	,	Dr.	Etienne-Emile	Baulieu	,	the	French	physician	who	*T*-488	invented	RU-486	,	wrote	in	a	Science	magazine	article	last	month	that	the	rabbit-test	results	could	not	be	duplicated	*-487	in	rats	and	monkeys	.
The	drug	has	a	three-dimensional	structure	similar	to	that	of	DES	,	the	anti-miscarriage	drug	that	*T*-3	has	been	linked	*-1	to	cervical	and	vaginal	cancer	in	some	of	the	daughters	of	the	women	who	*T*-2	took	it	.
All	the	published	studies	recommend	that	women	on	whom	the	drug	proves	ineffective	*T*-1	not	carry	the	pregnancy	to	term	but	undergo	a	surgical	abortion	.
A	risk	of	birth	defects	,	a	sure	source	of	lawsuits	,	is	one	reason	0	the	U.S.	pharmaceutical	industry	is	steering	clear	of	RU-486	*T*-1	.
One	might	well	ask	:	Why	*	bother	with	this	drug	at	all	*T*-1	?
Some	abortion	advocates	have	been	asking	themselves	this	very	question	.
RU-486	``	probably	represents	a	technical	advance	in	an	area	where	none	is	needed	*-487	,	or	at	least	not	very	much	*T*-1	,	''	said	0	*T*-2	Phillip	Stubblefield	,	president	of	the	National	Abortion	Federation	,	at	a	reproductive	health	conference	in	1986	.
Many	physicians	have	expressed	concern	over	the	heavy	bleeding	,	which	*T*-1	occurs	even	if	the	drug	fails	*-2	to	induce	an	abortion	.
It	*EXP*-1	typically	takes	from	eight	to	10	years	*	to	obtain	the	Food	and	Drug	Administration	's	approval	for	a	new	drug	,	and	the	cost	of	*	testing	and	marketing	a	new	drug	can	range	from	$	30	million	*U*	to	$	70	million	*U*	.
The	Health	and	Human	Services	Department	currently	forbids	the	National	Institutes	of	Health	from	*-1	funding	abortion	research	as	part	of	its	$	8	million	*U*	contraceptive	program	.
But	the	Population	Council	,	a	37-year-old	,	$	20	million	*U*	nonprofit	organization	that	*T*-487	has	the	backing	of	the	Rockefeller	and	Mellon	foundations	and	currently	subsidizes	most	U.S.	research	on	contraceptives	,	has	recently	been	paying	for	U.S.	studies	of	RU-486	on	a	license	from	its	French	developer	,	Roussel-Uclaf	,	a	joint	subsidiary	of	the	German	pharmaceutical	company	Hoechst	and	the	French	government	.
In	the	year	since	the	pill	went	on	the	French	market	,	the	National	Organization	for	Women	and	its	offshoot	,	former	NOW	President	Eleanor	Smeal	's	Fund	for	a	Feminist	Majority	,	have	been	trying	*-1	to	browbeat	the	U.S.	pharmaceutical	industry	into	*-2	getting	involved	.
-LRB-	Its	scare-tactic	prediction	:	the	pill	``	will	be	available	in	the	U.S.	,	either	legally	or	illegally	,	in	no	more	than	2-5	years	.	''	-RRB-
Following	the	feminist	and	population-control	lead	has	been	*T*-1	a	generally	bovine	press	.
A	June	1988	article	in	Mother	Jones	magazine	is	typical	of	the	general	level	of	media	ignorance	.
``	For	a	woman	whose	period	*T*-487	is	late	,	*	using	RU-486	means	no	waiting	,	no	walking	past	picket	lines	at	abortion	clinics	,	and	no	feet	up	in	stirrups	for	surgery	,	''	burbles	*T*-1	health	writer	Laura	Fraser	.
``	It	also	means	0	she	will	never	have	*-1	to	know	whether	she	had	actually	been	pregnant	.	''
Wrong	on	all	counts	,	Miss	Fraser	.
RU-486	is	being	administered	*-487	in	France	only	under	strict	supervision	in	the	presence	of	a	doctor	.
-LRB-	Roussel	reportedly	has	every	pill	marked	*-1	and	accounted	for	*-1	*	to	make	sure	0	none	slips	into	the	black	market	.	-RRB-
Thus	,	a	woman	who	*T*-487	used	RU-486	*-3	to	have	an	abortion	would	have	*-1	to	make	three	trips	to	the	clinic	past	those	picket	lines	;	an	initial	visit	for	medical	screening	-LRB-	anemics	and	those	with	previous	pregnancy	problems	are	eliminated	*-4	-RRB-	and	*	to	take	the	pill	,	a	second	trip	48	hours	later	for	the	prostaglandin	,	administered	*	either	via	injection	or	vaginal	suppository	,	and	a	third	trip	a	week	later	*	to	make	sure	0	she	has	completely	aborted	.
Furthermore	,	because	timing	is	so	critical	with	RU-486	,	she	will	learn	,	via	a	pelvic	examination	and	ultrasound	,	not	only	that	she	is	pregnant	,	but	just	how	pregnant	she	is	*T*-1	.
No	doctor	who	*T*-1	fears	malpractice	liability	would	likely	expose	a	non-pregnant	patient	to	the	risk	of	hemorrhaging	.
Many	women	may	even	see	the	dead	embryo	0	they	have	expelled	*T*-1	,	a	sight	0	the	surgical-abortion	industry	typically	spares	them	*T*-2	.
At	seven	weeks	,	an	embryo	is	about	three-fourths	of	an	inch	long	and	recognizably	human	.
At	the	behest	of	pro-choice	members	of	Congress	,	a	four-year	reauthorization	bill	for	Title	X	federal	family-planning	assistance	now	contains	a	$	10	million	*U*	grant	for	``	development	,	evaluation	and	bringing	to	the	marketplace	of	new	improved	contraceptive	devices	,	drugs	and	methods	.	''
If	this	passes	--	a	Senate	version	has	already	been	cleared	*-1	for	a	floor	vote	that	*T*-2	is	likely	early	next	year	--	it	would	put	the	federal	government	into	the	contraceptive	marketing	business	for	the	first	time	.
It	also	could	put	the	government	into	the	RU-486	business	,	which	*T*-487	would	please	feminists	dismayed	*	at	what	they	view	*T*-488	as	pusillanimity	in	the	private-sector	drug	industry	.
We	do	not	know	whether	RU-486	will	be	as	disastrous	as	some	of	the	earlier	fertility-control	methods	released	*	to	unblinking	,	uncritical	cheers	from	educated	people	who	*T*-487	should	have	known	better	.
-LRB-	*	Remember	the	Dalkon	Shield	and	the	early	birth-control	pills	?	-RRB-
We	will	not	know	until	a	first	generation	of	female	guinea	pigs	--	all	of	whom	*T*-1	will	be	more	than	happy	*-2	to	volunteer	for	the	job	--	has	put	the	abortion	pill	through	the	clinical	test	of	time	.
Mrs.	Allen	is	a	senior	editor	of	Insight	magazine	.
This	article	is	adapted	*-1	from	one	in	the	October	American	Spectator	.
On	June	30	,	a	major	part	of	our	trade	deficit	went	poof	!
No	figure	juggling	;	no	witchcraft	;	just	vastly	improved	recording	of	some	of	our	exports	.
The	result	?
The	Commerce	Department	found	that	U.S.	exports	in	1988	,	net	of	imports	,	were	understated	*-1	by	$	20.9	billion	*U*	a	year	and	understated	*-1	at	the	annualized	rate	of	$	25.4	billion	*U*	in	the	first	quarter	of	1989	.
More	than	half	of	the	``	newly	found	''	net	exports	were	from	just	a	few	service-sector	categories	.
Some	of	the	biggest	service-industry	exporters	--	American	financial-service	companies	,	for	example	--	have	yet	*-1	to	be	fully	included	*-2	in	our	export	statistics	.
Nearly	10	years	ago	,	representatives	of	service-sector	companies	worked	out	a	plan	*ICH*-1	with	the	Commerce	Department	*	to	improve	the	data	on	service-sector	exports	.
Both	groups	believed	that	tens	of	billions	of	dollars	of	service	exports	--	such	as	inbound	tourism	;	legal	,	accounting	and	other	professional	services	furnished	*	to	foreigners	;	financial	,	engineering	and	construction	services	;	and	the	like	--	were	not	being	counted	*-1	as	exports	.
The	monthly	``	trade	deficit	''	figure	is	limited	*-1	to	traditional	merchandise	trade	:	manufactured	goods	and	raw	materials	.
In	the	quarterly	balance-of-payments	report	,	those	merchandise	trade	figures	are	merged	*-1	with	statistics	on	exports	and	imports	of	services	,	as	well	as	returns	on	investments	abroad	by	Americans	and	returns	on	foreign	investments	in	the	U.S.	.
Over	time	,	through	benchmark	surveys	,	the	corrected	data	on	service	exports	and	imports	have	been	gathered	*-1	.
The	first	three	major	areas	of	the	service	sector	0	*T*-2	to	be	revamped	*-1	were	expenditures	by	foreign	students	in	the	U.S.	.	-LRB-	net	after	expenditures	by	Americans	studying	abroad	-RRB-	,	some	exports	by	professional	firms	-LRB-	a	law	firm	billing	a	German	client	for	services	rendered	*	in	*	watching	legislation	in	Washington	is	as	much	an	export	as	shipment	of	an	American	jet	engine	-RRB-	,	and	improved	data	from	travel	and	tourism	.
In	just	these	three	areas	,	the	Commerce	Department	found	$	23	billion	*U*	more	exports	than	*	previously	reported	*-1	and	$	11.6	billion	*U*	more	imports	,	with	the	net	result	that	the	U.S.	service	surplus	in	1988	increased	by	$	11.3	billion	*U*	,	to	$	19	billion	*U*	.
Combined	with	recalculations	and	revisions	in	other	trade	areas	,	the	value	of	U.S.	net	exports	that	*T*-2	had	not	previously	been	recorded	*-1	was	about	$	20	billion	*U*	a	year	.
That	means	that	the	U.S.	trade	deficit	was	running	closer	to	$	75	billion	*U*	than	to	$	95	billion	*U*	in	1988	,	and	$	55	billion	*U*	-LRB-	annualized	*	-RRB-	rather	than	$	80	billion	*U*	in	the	first	quarter	of	1989	.
These	revised	figures	also	may	explain	some	of	the	recent	strength	of	the	dollar	.
The	materially	smaller	trade	deficit	may	have	been	already	discounted	*-1	in	the	market	.
What	does	this	mean	*T*-1	for	trade	policy	?
Too	early	*	to	tell	,	but	a	trade	deficit	that	*T*-1	is	significantly	smaller	than	we	imagined	does	suggest	a	review	of	our	trade	posture	.
It	does	not	relieve	the	need	for	our	market-opening	efforts	for	both	goods	and	services	,	but	it	does	suggest	that	it	is	our	exports	of	services	,	and	not	just	borrowing	,	that	*T*-1	is	financing	our	imports	of	goods	.

The	collapse	of	a	$	6.79	billion	*U*	labor-management	buy-out	of	United	Airlines	parent	UAL	Corp.	may	not	stop	some	of	Wall	Street	's	top	talent	from	*-1	collecting	up	to	$	53.7	million	*U*	in	fees	.
According	to	one	person	familiar	with	the	airline	,	the	buy-out	group	--	led	*	by	United	's	pilots	union	and	UAL	Chairman	Stephen	Wolf	--	has	begun	*-2	billing	UAL	for	fees	and	expenses	0	it	owes	*T*-1	to	investment	bankers	,	law	firms	and	banks	.
The	tab	even	covers	$	8	million	*U*	in	commitment	fees	owed	*	to	Citicorp	and	Chase	Manhattan	Corp.	,	even	though	their	failure	*	to	obtain	$	7.2	billion	*U*	in	bank	loans	for	the	buy-out	was	the	main	reason	for	its	collapse	.
Under	a	merger	agreement	reached	*	Sept.	14	,	the	UAL	board	agreed	*-1	to	reimburse	certain	of	the	buy-out	group	's	expenses	out	of	company	funds	even	if	the	transaction	was	n't	completed	*-2	,	provided	0	the	group	did	n't	breach	the	agreement	.
The	failure	*	to	obtain	financing	does	n't	by	itself	constitute	a	breach	.
The	merger	agreement	says	0	the	buy-out	group	is	entitled	*-2	to	be	repaid	*-1	$	26.7	million	*U*	in	fees	for	its	investment	bankers	,	Lazard	Freres	&	Co.	and	Salomon	Brothers	Inc.	,	and	its	law	firm	,	Paul	Weiss	Rifkind	Wharton	&	Garrison	.
The	buy-out	group	is	also	entitled	to	$	16	million	*U*	0	*T*-1	to	repay	a	fund	created	*	by	the	pilots	union	for	an	employee	stock	ownership	plan	.
In	addition	to	the	$	8	million	*U*	for	Citicorp	and	Chase	,	Salomon	Brothers	is	also	owed	*-1	$	3	million	*U*	for	*	promising	*	to	make	a	$	200	million	*U*	bridge	loan	.
A	spokesman	for	the	buy-out	group	was	n't	immediately	available	for	comment	.
Separately	,	UAL	stock	rose	$	4	*U*	a	share	to	$	175	*U*	in	composite	trading	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	on	reports	that	Los	Angeles	investor	Marvin	Davis	has	asked	United	Airlines	unions	if	they	're	interested	in	*	cooperating	with	Mr.	Davis	in	a	new	bid	for	UAL	.
But	neither	the	pilots	nor	the	machinists	appear	interested	,	and	Mr.	Davis	is	barred	*-1	from	*-3	making	a	new	bid	under	terms	of	an	agreement	0	he	made	*T*-2	with	UAL	in	September	unless	UAL	accepts	an	offer	below	$	300	*U*	a	share	.
Wall	Street	continued	*-1	to	buckle	under	the	public	outcry	against	computer-driven	program	trading	.
Kidder	,	Peabody	&	Co.	,	a	unit	of	General	Electric	Co.	,	announced	0	it	would	stop	*-1	doing	stock-index	arbitrage	for	its	own	account	,	and	Merrill	Lynch	&	Co.	pulled	out	of	the	practice	altogether	.
At	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	,	which	*T*-2	has	been	buffeted	*-1	by	complaints	from	angry	individual	investors	and	the	exchange	's	own	listed	companies	,	Chairman	John	J.	Phelan	Jr.	held	an	emergency	meeting	with	senior	partners	of	some	of	the	Big	Board	's	49	stock	specialist	firms	.
The	specialists	,	a	trader	said	0	*T*-1	,	were	``	livid	''	about	Mr.	Phelan	's	recent	remarks	that	sophisticated	computer-driven	trading	strategies	are	``	here	*-2	to	stay	.	''
Many	investors	blame	program	trading	for	wild	swings	in	the	stock	market	,	including	the	190-point	plunge	in	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	on	Oct.	13	.
A	specialist	is	an	exchange	member	designated	*	to	maintain	a	fair	and	orderly	market	in	a	specified	stock	.
Mr.	Phelan	's	meeting	with	the	floor	brokers	comes	as	he	prepares	*-1	to	explain	the	exchange	's	position	on	program	trading	to	key	congressional	regulators	in	a	closed	session	tomorrow	,	according	to	exchange	officials	.
A	Big	Board	spokesman	would	only	say	,	``	We	're	working	the	problem	and	looking	at	the	issue	and	meeting	with	a	broad	number	of	customers	and	constituents	*-1	to	get	their	views	and	ideas	on	the	issue	.	''
The	program-trading	outcry	was	taken	*-1	to	a	new	level	when	giant	Contel	Corp.	said	0	it	and	20	or	more	of	the	Big	Board	's	listed	companies	are	forming	an	unprecedented	alliance	*-3	to	complain	about	the	exchange	's	role	in	program	trading	*T*-2	.
The	decision	by	Merrill	,	the	nation	's	largest	securities	firm	,	represents	the	biggest	retreat	yet	from	program	trading	.
Merrill	has	been	the	fourth-biggest	stock-index	arbitrage	trader	on	the	Big	Board	this	year	,	*-1	executing	an	average	of	18.1	million	shares	a	month	in	such	trades	,	or	about	one	million	shares	a	day	.
Merrill	's	move	is	one	of	the	most	sweeping	program-trading	pullbacks	of	recent	days	,	because	the	big	securities	firm	will	no	longer	execute	stock-index	arbitrage	trades	for	customers	.
Most	Wall	Street	firms	,	in	*-1	pulling	back	,	have	merely	stopped	such	trading	for	their	own	accounts	.
Merrill	has	been	one	of	the	main	firms	executing	index	arbitrage	for	customers	.
Merrill	also	said	0	it	is	lobbying	for	significant	regulatory	controls	on	program	trading	,	including	tough	margin	--	or	down-payment	--	requirements	and	limits	on	price	moves	for	program-driven	financial	futures	.
Merrill	,	in	a	statement	by	Chairman	William	A.	Schreyer	and	President	Daniel	P.	Tully	,	said	0	index	arbitrage	``	has	been	clearly	identified	in	the	investing	public	's	mind	as	a	contributing	factor	to	excess	market	volatility	,	''	so	Merrill	wo	n't	execute	such	trades	until	``	effective	controls	''	are	in	place	.
In	stock-index	arbitrage	,	traders	buy	and	sell	large	amounts	of	stocks	with	offsetting	trades	in	stock-index	futures	and	options	.
The	idea	is	*	to	lock	in	profits	from	short-term	swings	in	volatile	markets	.
Last	Thursday	,	PaineWebber	Group	Inc.	also	said	0	it	would	cease	index	arbitrage	altogether	,	but	the	firm	was	n't	as	big	an	index	arbitrager	as	Merrill	is	*?*	.
Other	large	firms	,	including	Bear	,	Stearns	&	Co.	and	Morgan	Stanley	&	Co.	,	last	week	announced	a	pullback	from	index	arbitrage	,	but	only	for	the	firms	'	own	accounts	.
Kidder	made	an	abrupt	about-face	on	program	trading	yesterday	,	after	a	special	meeting	between	the	firm	's	president	and	chief	executive	officer	,	Michael	Carpenter	,	and	its	senior	managers	.
Just	a	week	ago	,	Mr.	Carpenter	staunchly	defended	index	arbitrage	at	Kidder	,	the	most	active	index-arbitrage	trading	firm	on	the	stock	exchange	this	year	.
Index	arbitrage	,	Mr.	Carpenter	said	0	*T*-1	last	week	,	does	n't	have	a	``	negative	impact	on	the	market	as	a	whole	''	and	Kidder	's	customers	were	``	sophisticated	''	enough	*	to	know	that	.
But	yesterday	,	Mr.	Carpenter	said	0	big	institutional	investors	,	which	he	would	n't	identify	*T*-2	,	``	told	us	0	they	would	n't	do	business	with	firms	''	that	*T*-1	continued	*-3	to	do	index	arbitrage	for	their	own	accounts	.
``	We	were	following	the	trend	of	our	competitors	who	*T*-1	were	under	pressure	from	institutions	,	''	he	said	*T*-2	.
Kidder	so	far	this	year	has	executed	a	monthly	average	of	37.8	million	shares	in	index-arbitrage	trading	,	and	is	second	only	to	Morgan	Stanley	in	overall	program	trading	,	which	*T*-1	includes	index	arbitrage	.
Most	of	Kidder	's	program	trading	is	for	its	own	account	,	according	to	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	.
Kidder	denied	that	GE	's	chairman	and	chief	executive	,	John	F.	Welch	,	had	anything	0	*	to	do	*T*-1	with	Kidder	's	decision	.
But	at	least	one	chief	executive	said	0	he	called	Mr.	Welch	*-1	to	complain	about	Kidder	's	aggressive	use	of	program	trading	,	and	other	market	sources	said	0	they	understood	that	Mr.	Welch	received	many	phone	calls	complaining	about	Kidder	's	reliance	on	index	arbitrage	as	a	major	business	.
Kidder	has	generally	been	sensitive	to	suggestions	that	GE	makes	decisions	for	its	Kidder	unit	.
``	Our	decision	had	nothing	0	*	to	do	*T*-1	with	any	pressure	0	Mr.	Welch	received	*T*-2	,	''	Mr.	Carpenter	said	*T*-3	.
``	This	was	a	Kidder	Peabody	stand-alone	decision	.	''
A	spokeswoman	for	GE	in	Fairfield	,	Conn.	,	said	,	``	Absolutely	no	one	spoke	to	Jack	Welch	on	this	subject	''	and	added	,	``	Anyone	who	*T*-1	claims	0	they	talked	to	Jack	Welch	is	n't	telling	the	truth	.	''
Supporters	of	index	arbitrage	have	n't	been	publicly	sticking	up	for	the	trading	strategy	,	as	some	did	during	the	post-crash	outcry	of	1987	.
But	Merrill	Lynch	,	in	its	statement	about	*	pulling	out	of	index	arbitrage	,	suggested	that	the	current	debate	has	missed	the	mark	.
Merrill	said	0	it	continues	*-1	to	believe	that	``	the	causes	of	excess	market	volatility	are	far	more	complex	than	any	particular	computer	trading	strategy	.
Indeed	,	there	are	legitimate	hedging	strategies	used	*	by	managers	of	large	portfolios	such	as	pension	funds	that	*T*-1	involve	program	trading	as	a	means	of	*	protecting	the	assets	of	their	pension	beneficiaries	.	''
Merrill	's	index	arbitragers	will	continue	*-1	to	do	other	kinds	of	computer-assisted	program	trading	,	so	there	probably	wo	n't	be	any	layoffs	at	the	firm	,	people	familiar	with	Merrill	's	program	operation	said	0	*T*-2	.
Meanwhile	,	Bear	Stearns	Chairman	and	Chief	Executive	Alan	C.	Greenberg	said	0	his	firm	will	continue	stock-index	arbitrage	for	its	clients	.
At	the	firm	's	annual	meeting	last	night	,	he	told	shareholders	that	index	arbitrage	wo	n't	go	away	,	despite	the	public	outcry	.
``	If	they	think	0	they	are	going	*-2	to	stop	index	arbitrage	by	*-3	causing	a	few	Wall	Street	firms	to	quit	,	they	are	crazy	,	''	Mr.	Greenberg	said	*T*-1	.
``	It	's	not	going	*-1	to	stop	it	at	all	.	''
Mr.	Greenberg	,	*-1	noting	that	stock-index	arbitrage	rises	and	ebbs	with	stock	market	's	volatility	,	said	that	for	the	first	four	months	of	the	firm	's	fiscal	year	beginning	in	July	,	stock-index	arbitrage	had	been	a	``	break-even	''	proposition	for	Bear	Stearns	.
In	response	to	a	shareholder	's	suggestion	,	Mr.	Greenberg	agreed	that	European	firms	will	simply	pick	up	the	index-arbitrage	business	left	*	behind	by	U.S.	institutions	.
Pressure	from	big	institutional	investors	has	been	the	major	catalyst	for	Wall	Street	's	program-trading	pullback	.
And	there	was	speculation	*ICH*-2	yesterday	that	Fidelity	Investments	and	other	large	mutual-fund	companies	might	soon	follow	the	lead	of	Kemper	Corp.	and	other	institutions	in	*	cutting	off	trading	business	to	securities	firms	that	*T*-1	do	program	trading	.
A	Fidelity	spokesman	in	Boston	denied	the	speculation	,	*-1	saying	0	the	program-trading	issue	was	more	of	a	regulatory	problem	.
But	a	much	smaller	mutual	fund	company	,	the	USAA	Investment	Management	Co.	unit	of	USAA	,	San	Antonio	,	Texas	,	said	0	it	informed	nine	national	brokerage	firms	0	it	will	cease	business	with	them	unless	they	stop	index-arbitrage	trading	.
USAA	,	with	400,000	mutual	fund	accounts	,	manages	more	than	$	10	billion	*U*	,	$	2	billion	*U*	of	which	*T*-1	is	in	the	stock	market	.
Michael	J.C.	Roth	,	USAA	executive	vice	president	,	called	program	trading	``	mindless	.	''
He	said	0	there	is	``	no	valid	investment	reason	''	0	for	stock-index	futures	to	exist	*T*-1	.
A	program-bashing	move	is	clearly	on	.
Charles	Wohlstetter	,	chairman	of	Contel	,	who	*T*-2	is	helping	organize	the	alliance	of	Big	Board-listed	firms	,	said	0	he	had	no	time	0	*	to	work	*T*-3	yesterday	because	he	received	so	many	phone	calls	,	faxes	and	letters	supporting	his	view	that	the	Big	Board	has	been	turned	*-1	into	a	``	gambling	casino	''	by	program	traders	.
``	We	are	reaching	the	moment	of	truth	''	on	Wall	Street	,	said	0	*T*-1	Rep.	Edward	J.	Markey	-LRB-	D.	,	Mass.	-RRB-	,	chairman	of	the	House	subcommittee	on	telecommunications	and	finance	.
``	-LCB-	Wall	Street	-RCB-	is	beginning	*-1	to	realize	--	as	Shakespeare	said	--	0	the	trouble	is	not	in	our	stars	,	but	in	ourselves	.	''

An	ancient	red-figured	Greek	kylix	,	or	drinking	cup	,	was	recovered	*-2	backstage	at	Sotheby	's	this	spring	and	has	been	returned	*-2	to	the	Manhattan	couple	who	*T*-1	lost	it	in	a	burglary	three	years	ago	.
Robert	Guy	,	an	associate	curator	at	the	Princeton	Art	Museum	,	was	previewing	a	June	antiquities	sale	at	the	auction	house	when	he	recognized	the	kylix	,	which	he	,	as	a	specialist	in	Attic	pottery	and	a	careful	reader	of	the	Stolen	Art	Alert	in	``	IFAR	Reports	,	''	knew	0	*T*-3	was	stolen	*-1	*T*-2	.
The	timing	of	his	visit	was	fortuitous	;	the	man	who	*T*-1	had	brought	it	in	for	an	estimate	had	returned	*-2	to	collect	it	and	was	waiting	in	the	hall	.
*-3	To	confirm	Mr.	Guy	's	identification	,	Sotheby	's	and	IFAR	exchanged	photos	by	fax	,	and	the	waiting	man	,	*-2	apparently	innocent	of	knowledge	that	the	kylix	was	stolen	*-1	,	agreed	*-2	to	release	it	.
The	cup	had	been	insured	*-1	,	and	in	short	order	it	was	given	over	*-2	to	a	Chubb	&	Son	representative	.
The	original	owners	happily	repaid	the	claim	and	took	their	kylix	home	.
A	former	curator	of	the	Museum	of	Cartoon	Art	in	Rye	Brook	,	N.Y.	,	pleaded	guilty	in	July	to	*-1	stealing	and	selling	original	signed	and	dated	comic	strips	,	among	them	29	Dick	Tracy	strips	by	Chester	Gould	,	77	Prince	Valiant	Sunday	cartoons	by	Hal	Foster	,	and	a	dozen	Walt	Disney	animation	celluloids	,	according	to	Barbara	Hammond	,	the	museum	's	director	.
He	sold	them	well	below	market	value	*-2	to	raise	cash	``	*-3	to	pay	off	mounting	credit-card	debts	,	''	incurred	*	*	to	buy	presents	for	his	girlfriend	,	his	attorney	,	Philip	Russell	,	told	IFAR	0	*T*-1	.
The	curator	,	27-year-old	Sherman	Krisher	of	Greenwich	,	Conn.	,	had	worked	his	way	up	from	janitor	in	seven	years	at	the	museum	.
The	theft	was	discovered	*-1	early	this	year	,	soon	after	Ms.	Hammond	took	her	post	.
Sentencing	was	postponed	*-1	on	Aug.	18	,	when	Mr.	Krisher	was	hospitalized	*-2	for	depression	*T*-3	.
His	efforts	*	to	get	back	the	stolen	strips	had	resulted	in	recovery	of	just	three	.
But	on	Oct.	6	,	he	had	reason	0	*	to	celebrate	*T*-1	.
Two	days	earlier	,	his	attorney	met	in	a	Park	Avenue	law	office	with	a	cartoon	dealer	who	*T*-1	expected	*-2	to	sell	44	of	the	most	important	stolen	strips	to	Mr.	Russell	for	$	62,800	*U*	.
Instead	,	New	York	City	police	seized	the	stolen	goods	,	and	Mr.	Krisher	avoided	jail	.
He	was	sentenced	*-1	to	500	hours	of	community	service	and	restitution	to	the	museum	of	$	45,000	*U*	.
Authorities	at	London	's	Heathrow	Airport	are	investigating	the	disappearance	of	a	Paul	Gauguin	watercolor	,	``	Young	Tahitian	Woman	in	a	Red	Pareo	,	''	that	*T*-1	has	two	sketches	on	its	verso	-LRB-	opposite	-RRB-	side	.
*-2	Valued	*-1	at	$	1.3	million	*U*	,	it	was	part	of	a	four-crate	shipment	.
The	air-waybill	number	was	changed	*-1	en	route	,	and	paper	work	showing	that	the	crates	had	cleared	customs	was	misplaced	*-2	,	so	it	was	a	week	before	three	of	the	four	crates	could	be	located	*-3	in	a	bonded	warehouse	and	the	Gauguin	discovered	*-5	missing	.
Although	Heathrow	authorities	have	been	watching	a	group	of	allegedly	crooked	baggage	handlers	for	some	time	,	the	Gauguin	may	be	``	lost	.	''
Chief	Inspector	Peter	Seacomb	of	the	Criminal	Investigation	Department	at	the	airport	said	,	``	It	*EXP*-1	is	not	uncommon	for	property	to	be	temporarily	mislaid	or	misrouted	*-2	.	''
Officials	at	the	University	of	Virginia	Art	Museum	certainly	would	agree	.
Their	museum	had	purchased	an	Attic	black-figured	column	krater	and	shipped	it	from	London	.
It	was	reported	*-1	stolen	in	transit	en	route	to	Washington	,	D.C.	,	in	February	.
Months	later	,	the	Greek	vase	arrived	in	good	condition	at	the	museum	in	Charlottesville	,	*-1	having	inexplicably	traveled	by	a	circuitous	route	through	Nairobi	.
Two	Mexican	college	dropouts	,	not	professional	art	thieves	,	have	been	arrested	*-1	for	a	1985	Christmas	Eve	burglary	from	the	National	Museum	of	Anthropology	in	Mexico	City	.
About	140	Mayan	,	Aztec	,	Mixtec	and	Zapotec	objects	,	including	some	of	Mexico	's	best-known	archaeological	treasures	,	were	taken	*-1	.
The	government	offered	a	reward	for	the	return	of	the	antiquities	,	but	routine	police	work	led	to	the	recovery	.
As	it	turned	out	,	Carlos	Perches	Trevino	and	Ramon	Sardina	Garcia	had	hidden	the	haul	in	a	closet	in	the	Perches	family	's	home	for	a	year	.
Then	they	took	the	art	to	Acapulco	and	began	*-1	to	trade	some	of	it	for	cocaine	.
Information	from	an	arrested	drug	trafficker	led	to	the	two	men	and	the	recovery	of	almost	all	the	stolen	art	.
Among	other	happy	news	bulletins	from	the	German	Democratic	Republic	,	the	Leipzig	Museum	of	Fine	Arts	announced	that	it	has	recovered	``	Cemetery	in	the	Snow	,	''	a	painting	by	the	German	Romantic	painter	Caspar	David	Friedrich	.
The	artist	's	melancholy	subjects	bring	high	prices	on	the	world	market	,	and	the	U.S.	State	Department	notified	IFAR	of	the	theft	in	February	1988	.
According	to	a	source	at	the	East	Europe	desk	,	two	previously	convicted	felons	were	charged	*-1	,	tried	*-1	,	convicted	*-1	and	sentenced	*-1	to	prison	terms	of	four	and	12	years	.
The	precious	canvas	,	cut	*	from	its	frame	at	the	time	of	the	theft	,	was	found	*-1	in	nearby	Jena	,	*-1	hidden	*-2	in	the	upholstery	of	an	easy	chair	in	the	home	of	the	girlfriend	of	one	of	the	thieves	.
No	charges	were	brought	*-1	against	her	.
Trompe	l'oeil	painting	is	meant	*-1	to	fool	the	eye	,	but	Robert	Lawrence	Trotter	,	35	,	of	Kennett	Square	,	Pa.	,	took	his	fooling	seriously	.
He	painted	one	himself	in	the	style	of	John	Haberle	and	sold	it	as	a	19th-century	original	to	antique	dealers	in	Woodbridge	,	Conn	.
Mr.	Trotter	's	painting	showed	a	wall	of	wood	boards	with	painted	ribbons	tacked	down	in	a	rectangle	;	tucked	*-2	behind	the	ribbons	were	*T*-1	envelopes	,	folded	,	faded	and	crumpled	papers	and	currency	.
Mr.	Trotter	's	fake	Haberle	was	offered	*-1	at	a	bargain	price	of	$	25,000	*U*	with	a	phony	story	that	it	belonged	to	his	wife	's	late	aunt	in	New	Canaan	,	Conn	.
The	dealers	immediately	showed	their	new	acquisition	to	an	expert	and	came	*-1	to	see	it	as	a	fake	.
They	persuaded	Mr.	Trotter	*-1	to	take	it	back	and	,	with	the	help	of	the	FBI	,	taped	their	conversation	with	him	.
After	his	arrest	,	the	forger	admitted	to	*-1	faking	and	selling	other	paintings	up	and	down	the	Eastern	seaboard	.

Separately	,	Ford	and	Mazda	Motor	Corp.	's	U.S.	sales	arm	said	0	they	are	recalling	about	88,500	1988-model	Mercury	Tracers	and	220,000	1986	,	1987	and	1988	model	Mazda	323s	equipped	*	with	1.6-liter	fuel-injected	engines	*-1	to	replace	the	oil	filler	cap	.
Mazda	makes	the	Tracer	for	Ford	.
As	a	result	of	the	adhesive	problem	on	the	Ford	Escort	subcompacts	,	windshields	may	easily	separate	from	the	car	during	frontal	impact	,	the	U.S.	auto	maker	said	0	*T*-1	.
When	*-2	properly	applied	*-3	*T*-1	,	the	adhesive	is	designed	*-2	to	retain	the	windshield	in	place	in	a	crash	test	at	30	miles	per	hour	.
A	Ford	spokesman	said	0	the	Dearborn	,	Mich.	,	auto	maker	is	n't	aware	of	any	injuries	caused	*	by	the	windshield	problem	.
Ford	said	0	owners	should	return	the	cars	to	dealers	so	the	windshields	can	be	removed	*-1	and	securely	reinstalled	*-1	.
Mazda	and	Ford	said	0	a	combination	of	limited	crankcase	ventilation	and	improper	maintenance	could	cause	engine	oil	in	some	of	the	Mercury	Tracers	and	Mazda	323s	to	deteriorate	more	rapidly	than	normal	,	*	causing	increased	engine	noise	or	reduced	engine	life	.
They	said	0	the	problems	are	n't	safety	related	.
Both	companies	will	replace	the	oil	filler	cap	with	a	ventilated	oil	filler	cap	.
Both	also	will	inspect	and	replace	,	if	necessary	,	oil	filters	and	oil	strainers	,	at	no	charge	to	owners	.
For	owners	who	*T*-1	have	followed	the	recommended	oil	maintenance	schedule	,	Mazda	will	extend	to	five	years	or	60,000	miles	the	warranty	term	for	engine	damage	due	to	abnormal	engine	oil	deterioration	.
The	normal	term	for	the	1986	and	1987	model	323	is	two	years	or	24,000	miles	;	the	term	for	the	1988	323	is	three	years	or	50,000	miles	.
Ford	said	0	the	term	on	its	warranty	is	already	six	years	or	60,000	miles	.
Separately	,	Ford	said	0	it	will	offer	$	750	*U*	cash	rebates	to	buyers	of	its	1990-model	Ford	Bronco	sport	utility	vehicle	.
It	said	0	it	will	also	offer	buyers	the	option	of	financing	as	low	as	6.9	%	on	24-month	loans	.
Ford	also	offered	the	low	financing	rate	option	on	1989-model	Broncos	,	which	*T*-1	previously	carried	a	$	750	*U*	cash	discount	.
Ford	said	0	the	new	offer	will	begin	Saturday	and	run	indefinitely	.
The	Supreme	Court	agreed	*-1	to	decide	whether	the	federal	Pension	Benefit	Guaranty	Corp.	may	require	LTV	Corp.	to	reassume	funding	responsibility	for	a	$	2.3	billion	*U*	shortfall	in	the	company	's	pension	plans	.
The	high	court	's	decision	,	expected	*	next	spring	,	may	affect	the	stability	of	many	large	corporate	pension	plans	that	*T*-1	have	relied	on	the	availability	of	pension	insurance	provided	*	by	the	federal	pension	regulatory	and	insurance	agency	.
The	agency	,	which	*T*-3	is	funded	*-1	through	insurance	premiums	from	employers	,	insures	pension	benefits	for	some	30	million	private-sector	workers	who	*T*-2	take	part	in	single-employer	pension	plans	.
It	recently	reported	assets	of	$	2.4	billion	*U*	and	liabilities	of	$	4	billion	*U*	.
In	its	appeal	to	the	high	court	,	the	agency	said	the	federal	appeals	court	ruling	,	which	*T*-1	favored	LTV	,	threatened	*-2	to	transform	the	agency	from	an	insurer	of	troubled	pension	plans	into	an	``	open-ended	source	of	industry	bailouts	.	''
The	ruling	also	may	determine	how	quickly	LTV	is	able	*-2	to	complete	its	Chapter	11	reorganization	*T*-1	.
LTV	filed	for	protection	under	Chapter	11	in	federal	bankruptcy	court	in	1986	.
The	filing	was	partly	the	result	of	the	$	2.3	billion	*U*	shortfall	in	LTV	's	three	pension	plans	operated	*	for	its	LTV	Steel	Co.	subsidiary	's	employees	.
In	January	1987	,	as	LTV	Steel	continued	operating	while	*-1	under	reorganization	,	the	agency	terminated	the	three	LTV	pension	plans	*-2	to	keep	its	insurance	liability	from	*-3	increasing	.
Termination	means	that	the	agency	's	insurance	assumes	the	liabilities	and	pays	the	pension	benefits	already	owed	*	under	the	plans	,	but	workers	do	n't	accrue	new	benefits	.
A	few	months	later	,	under	pressure	from	the	United	Steelworkers	of	America	,	LTV	instituted	a	new	program	0	*T*-1	to	provide	retirement	benefits	similar	to	those	in	the	terminated	plans	.
Because	the	federal	pension	agency	had	taken	over	the	old	plans	,	LTV	would	be	responsible	only	for	benefits	paid	*	under	the	new	pension	plans	.
But	the	agency	viewed	the	creation	of	the	new	plans	as	an	abuse	of	federal	pension	law	and	an	attempt	*	to	transfer	the	liability	of	the	$	2.3	billion	*U*	shortfall	from	LTV	to	federal	insurance	.
The	agency	also	concluded	that	LTV	's	financial	status	had	improved	while	it	was	under	reorganization	.
In	September	1987	,	it	ordered	LTV	*-1	to	reassume	liability	and	funding	for	the	three	original	plans	.
LTV	challenged	the	order	,	and	a	federal	district	court	in	New	York	in	June	1988	ruled	that	the	agency	improperly	ordered	LTV	*-1	to	reassume	responsibility	for	the	plans	.
In	May	,	a	federal	appeals	court	in	New	York	agreed	that	the	agency	acted	unlawfully	.
The	appeals	court	said	0	there	was	no	evidence	that	Congress	intended	*-1	to	allow	the	pension	agency	to	consider	a	company	's	creation	of	new	benefit	plans	as	a	basis	for	*	ordering	that	company	*-2	to	reassume	liability	for	old	plans	.
The	appeals	court	also	said	0	the	agency	had	*-1	to	consider	a	company	's	long-term	ability	*	to	fund	pension	plans	,	not	just	short-term	improved	financial	status	.
In	Dallas	,	LTV	said	that	it	was	disappointed	*-1	that	the	court	agreed	*-2	to	hear	the	case	because	it	believes	0	the	move	will	further	delay	its	Chapter	11	proceedings	.
The	company	has	n't	been	able	*-1	to	come	up	with	a	reorganization	plan	,	in	part	,	because	of	the	sizable	disagreement	with	the	pension	agency	.
But	LTV	,	a	steel	,	aerospace	and	energy	concern	,	said	0	it	is	confident	that	the	Supreme	Court	will	uphold	the	lower-court	decisions	and	said	0	it	expects	*-2	to	continue	discussions	with	the	agency	about	a	settlement	while	the	case	is	being	reviewed	*-1	.

Nissan	Motor	is	just	one	of	a	slew	of	advertisers	that	*T*-1	have	hitched	their	ads	to	the	devastating	San	Francisco	quake	and	Hurricane	Hugo	.
Sometimes	,	the	ads	attempt	*-1	to	raise	money	;	always	,	they	try	*-2	to	boost	good	will	.
By	*-1	advertising	disaster	relief	,	these	companies	are	hoping	*-1	to	don	a	white	hat	and	come	out	a	hero	.
But	the	strategy	can	backfire	;	if	the	ads	appear	too	self-serving	,	the	companies	may	end	up	*-1	looking	like	rank	opportunists	instead	of	good	Samaritans	.
That	has	n't	deterred	plenty	of	companies	.
Along	with	Nissan	,	Grand	Metropolitan	PLC	's	Burger	King	and	New	York	Life	Insurance	have	tied	ads	to	Red	Cross	donations	.
Other	ads	do	n't	bother	with	the	fundraising	;	a	touching	,	if	self-congratulatory	,	American	Telephone	&	Telegraph	ad	that	*T*-1	aired	Sunday	intermixed	footage	of	the	devastation	in	San	Francisco	and	Charleston	,	S.C.	,	with	interviews	of	people	recounting	how	AT&T	helped	*T*-2	.
At	Nissan	,	``	we	felt	0	we	wanted	*-2	to	do	something	*-3	to	help	them	gather	money	,	and	we	had	this	airtime	on	Monday	Night	Football	,	''	explains	0	*T*-1	Brooke	Mitzel	,	a	Nissan	advertising	creative	manager	.
``	What	did	we	get	*T*-1	out	of	it	?

The	ads	are	just	the	latest	evidence	of	how	television	advertising	is	getting	faster	on	the	draw	*T*-1	.
While	TV	commercials	typically	take	weeks	*	to	produce	*?*	,	advertisers	in	the	past	couple	of	years	have	learned	*-1	to	turn	on	a	dime	,	*-2	to	crash	out	ads	in	days	or	even	hours	.
The	big	brokerage	houses	learned	the	art	of	the	instant	commercial	after	the	1987	crash	,	when	they	turned	out	reassuring	ads	inviting	investors	right	back	into	the	stock	market	*T*-1	.
They	trotted	out	another	crop	of	instant	commercials	after	the	sudden	market	dip	a	few	weeks	ago	.
Nissan	created	its	quake	ad	in	a	weekend	.
But	as	advertisers	latch	onto	disasters	with	increasing	frequency	,	they	risk	*-1	hurting	themselves	as	much	as	*-1	helping	the	cause	.
They	chance	*-2	alienating	the	customers	0	they	hope	*-3	to	woo	*T*-1	by	*-4	looking	like	opportunistic	sharks	.
``	People	see	extra	messages	in	advertising	,	and	if	a	manufacturer	is	clearly	trying	*-1	to	get	something	out	of	it	...	if	it	's	too	transparent	...	then	consumers	will	see	through	that	,	''	warns	*T*-2	John	Philip	Jones	,	chairman	of	the	advertising	department	at	the	Newhouse	School	of	Public	Communications	at	Syracuse	University	.
``	It	can	backfire	because	companies	can	step	across	the	line	and	go	too	far	,	be	too	pushy	,	''	agrees	*T*-1	Gary	Stibel	,	a	principal	with	New	England	Consulting	Group	,	Westport	,	Conn	.
``	The	ultimate	form	of	charity	is	when	you	do	n't	tell	anyone	*T*-1	.	''

The	companies	running	the	disaster	ads	certainly	do	n't	see	themselves	as	ambulance	chasers	,	either	.
Burger	King	's	chief	executive	officer	,	Barry	Gibbons	,	stars	in	ads	saying	that	the	fast-food	chain	will	donate	25	cents	to	the	Red	Cross	for	every	purchase	of	a	BK	Doubles	hamburger	.

``	Barry	felt	very	committed	.

While	the	campaign	was	Mr.	Gibbons	's	idea	,	however	,	he	wo	n't	be	paying	for	it	:	The	donations	will	come	out	of	the	chain	's	national	advertising	fund	,	which	*T*-2	is	financed	*-1	by	the	franchisees	.

The	Supreme	Court	let	stand	a	New	York	court	's	ruling	that	the	manufacturers	of	a	drug	once	used	*	*	to	prevent	miscarriages	must	share	liability	for	injuries	or	deaths	when	the	maker	of	an	individual	dose	is	unknown	*T*-1	.
The	high	court	's	action	,	*	refusing	*-2	to	hear	appeals	by	several	drug	companies	,	is	likely	*-1	to	have	a	significant	impact	at	several	levels	.
The	most	immediate	effect	is	in	New	York	,	where	former	manufacturers	of	the	anti-miscarriage	drug	DES	--	the	synthetic	female	hormone	diethylstilbestrol	--	face	the	prospect	of	shared	liability	for	damages	in	many	of	the	700	to	1,000	DES	lawsuits	pending	in	that	state	*T*-1	.
The	lawsuits	stemmed	from	the	development	of	cancer	and	other	problems	in	the	daughters	of	women	who	*T*-1	took	the	drug	.
On	a	broader	scale	,	the	ruling	could	encourage	other	states	'	courts	to	adopt	the	logic	of	the	New	York	court	,	not	only	in	DES	cases	but	in	other	product-related	lawsuits	,	as	well	.
The	New	York	Court	of	Appeals	ruling	parallels	a	1980	decision	by	the	California	Supreme	Court	requiring	shared	liability	among	manufacturers	for	injuries	when	it	ca	n't	be	determined	which	company	*T*-2	is	at	fault	*T*-3	.
Paul	Rheingold	,	a	New	York	lawyer	who	*T*-1	represents	DES	victims	,	said	that	before	the	New	York	ruling	,	only	the	states	of	Washington	and	Wisconsin	had	followed	the	California	decision	.
Now	that	the	New	York	decision	has	been	left	*-1	intact	,	other	states	may	follow	suit	.
``	Generally	,	when	New	York	and	California	go	one	way	*T*-2	,	it	has	a	tremendous	influence	on	other	states	,	especially	small	ones	,	''	said	*T*-1	Mr.	Rheingold	.
The	high	court	refused	*-2	to	hear	appeals	by	Rexall	Drug	Co.	,	which	*T*-1	went	out	of	business	in	1987	and	was	taken	*-3	over	by	RXDC	Liquidating	Trust	;	E.R.	Squibb	&	Sons	Inc.	,	a	unit	of	Squibb	Corp.	;	and	Eli	Lilly	&	Co	.
The	appeals	involved	DES	,	which	*T*-2	was	approved	*-1	by	the	Food	and	Drug	Administration	for	use	from	the	1940s	until	1971	*	to	prevent	miscarriages	during	pregnancy	.
In	1971	,	the	FDA	banned	the	use	of	DES	after	studies	linked	it	to	cancer	and	other	problems	in	daughters	of	women	who	*T*-1	took	the	drug	.
Lawsuits	over	the	harm	caused	*	by	DES	have	flooded	federal	and	state	courts	in	the	past	decade	.
In	many	cases	,	the	lawsuit	was	filed	*-1	long	after	the	drug	was	used	*-2	--	the	cancer	in	the	daughters	was	typically	not	detected	*-4	for	years	--	and	there	is	no	way	0	*	to	prove	which	of	several	companies	*T*-3	manufactured	the	doses	consumed	*	by	certain	women	*T*-5	.
Under	traditional	legal	theories	,	inability	*	to	prove	which	company	*T*-1	manufactured	a	drug	that	*T*-2	caused	an	injury	or	death	would	lead	to	the	lawsuit	being	dismissed	*-3	.
But	in	its	ruling	last	April	,	the	New	York	court	said	that	all	producers	of	the	anti-miscarriage	drug	should	share	liability	when	the	manufacturer	of	a	specific	dose	ca	n't	be	determined	*-1	*T*-2	.
Each	company	's	share	of	liability	would	be	based	*-1	on	their	share	of	the	national	DES	market	.
The	New	York	court	also	upheld	a	state	law	,	passed	*	in	1986	,	extending	for	one	year	the	statute	of	limitations	on	filing	DES	lawsuits	.
The	effect	is	that	lawsuits	that	*T*-2	might	have	been	barred	*-3	because	they	were	filed	*-1	too	late	could	proceed	because	of	the	one-year	extension	.

Government	Contractors
The	high	court	,	*-1	leaving	intact	a	$	4.25	million	*U*	damage	award	against	General	Dynamics	Corp.	,	declined	*-1	to	resolve	questions	about	a	legal	defense	against	civil	lawsuits	often	used	*	by	government	contractors	.
Last	year	,	the	Supreme	Court	defined	when	companies	,	such	as	military	contractors	,	may	defend	themselves	against	lawsuits	for	deaths	or	injuries	by	*-2	asserting	that	they	were	simply	following	specifications	of	a	federal	government	contract	*T*-1	.
In	that	decision	,	the	high	court	said	0	a	company	must	prove	that	the	government	approved	precise	specifications	for	the	contract	,	that	those	specifications	were	met	*-1	and	that	the	government	was	warned	*-2	of	any	dangers	in	use	of	the	equipment	.
But	last	February	,	a	federal	appeals	court	in	New	Orleans	upheld	a	damage	award	against	General	Dynamics	,	*-1	rejecting	the	company	's	use	of	the	government	contractor	defense	.
The	appeals	court	said	0	the	defense	is	valid	only	if	federal	officials	did	more	than	*	rubber	stamp	a	company	's	design	or	plans	and	engaged	in	a	``	substantive	review	and	evaluation	''	on	a	par	with	a	policy	decision	.
General	Dynamics	appealed	to	the	high	court	,	*-1	backed	*-2	by	numerous	business	trade	groups	,	*-1	arguing	that	the	appeals	court	definition	restricts	the	defense	too	severely	.
General	Dynamics	was	sued	*-1	by	the	families	of	five	Navy	divers	who	*T*-3	were	killed	*-2	in	1982	after	they	re-entered	a	submarine	through	a	diving	chamber	.

He	should	consider	his	victory	a	mandate	*	to	continue	his	growth-oriented	economic	reforms	and	not	a	demand	that	he	move	further	left	.
If	he	follows	the	correct	path	,	he	may	be	able	*-1	to	look	back	on	this	election	as	the	high-water	mark	of	far-left	opposition	.
The	far	left	had	some	good	issues	even	if	it	did	not	have	good	programs	for	*	dealing	with	them	.
It	could	point	to	plenty	of	ailments	that	the	Spanish	economic	rejuvenation	so	far	has	failed	*-1	to	cure	*T*-2	.
Unemployment	still	is	officially	recorded	*-1	at	16.5	%	,	the	highest	rate	in	Europe	,	although	actual	joblessness	may	be	lower	.
Housing	is	scarce	and	public	services	--	the	court	system	,	schools	,	mail	service	,	telephone	network	and	the	highways	--	are	in	disgraceful	condition	.
Large	pockets	of	poverty	still	exist	.
The	left	also	is	critical	of	the	style	of	the	Socialist	government	--	a	remarkable	parallel	to	the	situation	in	Britain	.
Mr.	Gonzalez	and	his	colleagues	,	particularly	the	finance	minister	,	Carlos	Solchaga	,	are	charged	*-1	with	*-4	having	abandoned	their	socialist	principles	and	with	*-4	having	become	arrogant	elitists	who	*T*-2	refuse	even	*-3	to	go	on	television	-LRB-	controlled	*	by	the	state	-RRB-	*-5	to	face	their	accusers	.
In	response	to	this	,	the	Socialist	prime	minister	has	simply	cited	his	free-market	accomplishments	.
They	are	very	considerable	:	Since	1986	,	when	Spain	joined	the	European	Community	*T*-1	,	its	gross	domestic	product	has	grown	at	an	annual	average	of	4.6	%	--	the	fastest	in	the	EC	.
In	that	time	more	than	1.2	million	jobs	have	been	created	*-1	and	the	official	jobless	rate	has	been	pushed	*-2	below	17	%	from	21	%	.
A	14	%	inflation	rate	dropped	below	5	%	.
Net	foreign	investment	through	August	this	year	has	been	running	at	a	pace	of	$	12.5	billion	*U*	,	about	double	the	year-earlier	rate	.
Mr.	Gonzalez	also	has	split	with	the	left	in	*-1	reaffirming	Spain	's	NATO	commitment	and	in	*-1	renewing	a	defense	treaty	with	the	U.S.	.
Mr.	Gonzalez	is	not	quite	a	closet	supply-side	revolutionary	,	however	.
He	did	not	go	as	far	as	he	could	have	*?*	in	tax	reductions	;	indeed	he	combined	them	with	increases	in	indirect	taxes	.
Yet	the	best	0	the	far-left	could	do	*T*-1	was	not	enough	*	to	deter	the	biggest	voting	bloc	--	nearly	40	%	--	from	*-3	endorsing	the	direction	0	Spain	is	taking	*T*-2	.
Now	he	can	go	further	.
He	should	do	more	*-1	to	reduce	tax	rates	on	wealth	and	income	,	in	recognition	of	the	fact	that	those	cuts	yield	higher	,	not	lower	,	revenues	.
He	could	do	more	*-1	to	cut	public	subsidies	and	transfers	,	thus	*-1	making	funds	available	for	public	services	starved	*	of	money	for	six	years	.
The	voters	delivered	Mr.	Gonzalez	a	third	mandate	for	his	successes	.
They	,	as	well	as	numerous	Latin	American	and	East	European	countries	that	*T*-1	hope	*-3	to	adopt	elements	of	the	Spanish	model	,	are	supporting	the	direction	0	Spain	is	taking	*T*-2	.
It	*EXP*-1	would	be	sad	for	Mr.	Gonzalez	to	abandon	them	*-2	to	appease	his	foes	.

Oh	,	that	terrible	Mr.	Ortega	.
Just	when	American	liberalism	had	pulled	the	arms	plug	on	the	Contras	and	their	friend	Ronald	Reagan	*T*-3	,	along	comes	*T*-2	Mr.	Ortega	in	Costa	Rica	this	weekend	*-5	to	``	blunder	''	into	the	hands	of	what	*T*-1	are	often	called	*-4	conservatives	.
Conservatives	are	the	faction	in	U.S.	politics	which	*T*-1	always	said	that	Mr.	Ortega	and	his	friends	do	n't	want	*-2	to	hold	an	election	in	Nicaragua	.
Liberals	are	the	faction	that	*T*-1	says	,	*	Give	peace	a	chance	;	now	they	are	saying	0	Mr.	Ortega	should	give	them	a	break	,	lest	the	conservatives	ask	them	*-2	to	vote	for	bullets	instead	of	bandages	.
We	suspect	0	Daniel	Ortega	knows	the	difference	between	a	blunder	and	a	strategy	.
He	knows	that	*	making	George	Bush	look	silly	in	a	photograph	with	him	will	trigger	Noriegan	fulminations	,	and	that	*	announcing	an	end	to	the	liberals	'	cease-fire	will	produce	mainly	their	concern	over	the	Contras	'	military	activities	in	northern	Nicaragua	.
Mr.	Ortega	understands	better	than	those	who	*T*-1	worry	about	his	behavior	that	what	*T*-2	sustains	the	Sandinista	movement	is	not	democratic	peace	,	but	nondemocratic	unpeace	.
It	is	the	presence	of	internal	and	external	``	enemies	''	which	*T*-1	justifies	the	need	for	a	large	,	active	army	that	Mikhail	Gorbachev	's	Soviet	Union	continues	*-3	to	supply	*T*-2	with	bullets	.

Cetus	Corp.	said	0	the	government	of	Spain	approved	the	marketing	of	its	Proleukin	interleukin-2	drug	0	*T*-1	to	treat	kidney	cancer	.
The	biotechnology	concern	said	0	Spanish	authorities	must	still	clear	the	price	for	the	treatment	,	but	that	it	expects	*-1	to	receive	such	approval	by	year	end	.
Four	other	countries	in	Europe	have	approved	Proleukin	in	recent	months	.
Cetus	is	currently	trying	*-1	to	obtain	federal	regulatory	clearance	for	U.S.	distribution	.
The	Treasury	Department	proposed	that	banks	be	required	*-2	to	keep	detailed	records	of	international	wire	transfers	,	which	officials	believe	0	*T*-1	is	the	main	vehicle	used	*	by	drug	traffickers	*	to	move	billions	of	dollars	in	and	out	of	the	U.S.	.
In	recent	testimony	on	Capitol	Hill	,	Treasury	officials	said	0	they	were	considering	the	new	reporting	requirements	,	and	the	expected	publication	of	the	proposal	in	the	Federal	Register	today	is	the	first	official	step	toward	*	creating	final	regulations	.
The	Treasury	is	still	working	out	the	details	with	bank	trade	associations	and	the	other	government	agencies	that	*T*-1	have	a	hand	in	*	fighting	money	laundering	.
Among	the	possibilities	0	the	Treasury	is	considering	*T*-1	are	*T*-2	requirements	that	banks	keep	records	identifying	the	originators	and	recipients	of	international	wire	transfers	.
Another	suggestion	would	draw	banks	more	directly	into	*-3	tracking	down	money	launderers	by	*	developing	a	``	suspicious	international	wire	transfer	profile	,	''	which	banks	would	use	*T*-1	*-2	to	spotlight	questionable	payments	.
But	banks	may	prefer	*-2	using	a	profile	that	*T*-1	targets	selected	transactions	,	rather	than	a	blanket	reporting	requirement	.
Banks	now	are	required	only	*-1	to	report	cash	deposits	or	withdrawals	of	$	10,000	or	more	*U*	.
But	wire	transfers	from	a	standing	account	--	including	those	bigger	than	$	10,000	*U*	--	are	n't	reported	*-1	.
Officials	believe	0	this	has	left	a	gaping	loophole	that	illegal	drug	businesses	are	exploiting	*T*-1	.
Authorities	estimate	that	revenues	from	illegal	drugs	in	the	U.S.	total	about	$	110	billion	*U*	annually	.
Sen.	John	Kerry	-LRB-	D.	,	Mass.	-RRB-	,	chairman	of	a	Senate	Foreign	Relations	subcommittee	that	*T*-1	oversees	the	issue	of	money	laundering	,	criticized	the	proposal	for	*-3	ignoring	wire	transfers	between	foreign	banks	that	*T*-2	are	executed	and	cleared	*-4	on	U.S.	wire	systems	.
The	American	Bankers	Association	did	n't	have	any	comment	on	the	plan	.
The	proposal	now	enters	a	60-day	comment	period	,	after	which	the	Treasury	will	propose	final	regulations	*T*-1	,	followed	*	by	another	comment	period	.
Western	Union	Corp.	took	steps	*-1	to	withdraw	its	proposed	debt	swap	for	$	500	million	*U*	in	high-interest	notes	and	said	0	it	is	looking	at	other	alternatives	for	*	refinancing	the	debt	.
Western	Union	had	said	two	weeks	ago	that	it	might	withdraw	the	pending	offer	,	which	*T*-1	would	have	replaced	$	500	million	*U*	in	so-called	reset	notes	,	now	paying	19.25	%	annual	interest	and	set	*	to	come	due	in	1992	,	with	two	new	issues	paying	lower	interest	.
Yesterday	the	company	said	0	it	had	filed	a	request	*ICH*-1	with	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	*	to	withdraw	the	registration	statement	regarding	the	proposed	swap	.
A	Western	Union	spokesman	,	*-3	citing	adverse	developments	in	the	market	for	high-yield	``	junk	''	bonds	,	declined	*-3	to	say	what	alternatives	*T*-2	are	under	consideration	.
But	some	holders	of	the	Western	Union	notes	expect	the	company	to	propose	a	more-attractive	debt	swap	that	*T*-1	will	give	them	a	substantial	equity	stake	in	the	company	.
Western	Union	has	had	major	losses	in	recent	years	as	its	telex	business	has	faltered	in	the	face	of	competition	from	facsimile	machines	and	as	other	business	ventures	have	gone	awry	.
The	major	question	,	said	0	*T*-2	one	holder	who	*T*-1	asked	*-3	not	to	be	named	*-4	,	is	whether	New	York	investor	Bennett	S.	LeBow	,	whose	Brooke	Partners	*T*-5	controls	Western	Union	,	is	willing	*-6	to	offer	a	large	enough	equity	stake	*	to	entice	bondholders	into	*-7	agreeing	to	a	new	swap	.
The	$	500	million	*U*	in	notes	,	the	largest	chunk	of	Western	Union	's	$	640	million	*U*	in	long-term	debt	,	stems	from	the	company	's	major	restructuring	in	December	1987	.
The	notes	became	burdensome	when	reset	provisions	allowed	their	interest	rate	to	be	raised	*-3	to	19.25	%	last	June	*T*-2	.
Western	Union	had	offered	*-1	to	swap	each	$	1,000	*U*	face	amount	of	the	notes	for	six	shares	of	common	stock	and	two	new	debt	issues	:	a	$	500	*U*	note	paying	an	interest	rate	starting	at	16.75	%	annually	and	rising	in	later	years	,	due	in	1992	,	and	a	$	500	*U*	note	,	due	in	1997	,	paying	a	fixed	rate	of	17	%	and	including	rights	protecting	a	holder	against	a	decline	in	the	trading	price	of	the	bond	.
Western	Union	must	make	$	48	million	*U*	in	interest	payments	on	the	reset	notes	on	Dec.	15	,	and	a	company	spokesman	said	0	it	fully	intends	*-1	to	meet	the	payments	.
But	Western	Union	has	said	0	it	must	lower	the	interest	rate	on	its	debt	*-1	to	regain	full	financial	health	.
Genentech	Inc.	said	0	the	West	German	distributor	of	its	heart	drug	TPA	reached	a	joint	marketing	agreement	with	a	subsidiary	of	Hoechst	AG	,	which	*T*-1	makes	the	rival	anti-clotting	agent	streptokinase	.
The	biotechnology	concern	said	0	the	agreement	between	its	longtime	West	German	distributor	,	Boehringer-Ingleheim	's	Dr.	Karl	Thomae	G.m.b.H.	subsidiary	,	and	Hoechst	's	Behringwerke	subsidiary	was	an	attempt	*	to	expand	the	market	for	blood-clot	drugs	in	general	.
A	Genentech	spokeswoman	said	0	the	agreement	calls	for	Hoechst	to	promote	TPA	for	heart	patients	and	streptokinase	for	other	clot-reducing	purposes	.
Investors	in	the	over-the-counter	market	dumped	banking	and	insurance	issues	,	*	sending	the	Nasdaq	composite	index	lower	for	the	third	consecutive	session	.
All	Nasdaq	industry	indexes	finished	lower	,	with	financial	issues	hit	*-1	the	hardest	.
Despite	some	early	computer-guided	program	buying	,	the	Nasdaq	composite	fell	1.39	to	451.37	.
The	OTC	market	now	has	declined	in	eight	of	the	past	11	sessions	.
The	Nasdaq	bank	index	fell	5.00	to	432.61	,	while	the	insurance	index	fell	3.56	to	528.56	,	and	the	``	other	finance	''	index	dropped	3.27	to	529.32	.
The	largest	financial	issues	,	as	*	measured	by	the	Nasdaq	financial	index	,	tumbled	3.23	to
Meanwhile	,	the	index	of	the	100	biggest	non-financial	stocks	,	the	Nasdaq	100	,	gained	0.47	to	438.15	.
Profit-taking	accounted	for	much	of	the	slide	in	OTC	stock	prices	,	according	to	David	Mills	,	senior	vice	president	of	Boston	Company	Advisers	.
He	said	0	many	portfolio	managers	,	whose	year-end	bonuses	*T*-2	are	tied	*-1	to	annual	performance	,	are	selling	now	rather	than	*-3	risk	seeing	their	gains	erode	further	.
``	The	profit	locking-in	is	definitely	going	on	,	''	said	*T*-2	Mr.	Mills	,	whose	firm	*T*-1	manages	$	600	million	*U*	for	Boston	Co	.
Tax-loss	sellers	,	those	investors	who	*T*-1	sell	loss-making	stocks	so	they	can	deduct	their	losses	from	this	year	's	income	,	are	also	getting	out	,	Mr.	Mills	said	0	*T*-2	.
That	's	helping	*-1	put	pressure	on	both	the	market	's	winners	and	its	losers	.
``	The	stocks	that	*T*-1	have	been	the	best	are	having	big	pullbacks	,	and	the	ones	that	*T*-2	have	been	the	worst	are	getting	clobbered	*-4	,	''	Mr.	Mills	said	*T*-3	.
He	expects	the	market	to	sink	further	and	to	reach	a	low	sometime	next	month	or	in	December	.
The	selling	by	money	managers	and	individual	investors	is	turning	traders	bearish	as	well	.
``	We	are	advising	a	lot	of	our	clients	*-2	to	make	moves	that	*T*-1	make	sense	to	them	,	rather	than	*-4	waiting	until	the	last	minute	,	because	things	have	been	so	volatile	,	''	said	*T*-3	William	Sulya	,	head	of	OTC	trading	at	A.G.	Edwards	&	Sons	in	St.	Louis	.
Ralph	Costanza	,	head	of	the	OTC	trading	department	at	Smith	Barney	,	Harris	Upham	,	said	0	many	market	players	are	awaiting	some	resolution	of	the	current	debate	over	program	trading	.
Much	of	the	market	's	recent	volatility	has	been	blamed	*-1	on	this	large-scale	computerized	trading	technique	that	*T*-2	can	send	stock	prices	surging	or	plummeting	in	a	matter	of	minutes	.
The	problem	has	been	particularly	damaging	to	the	OTC	market	,	traditionally	a	base	for	the	small	investor	.

Late	Friday	,	the	company	reported	a	loss	of	$	51.3	million	*U*	for	the	third	quarter	after	*-1	earning	$	9.2	million	*U*	a	year	before	.
The	loss	came	after	a	$	23.3	million	*U*	addition	to	loan-loss	reserves	.
The	bank	made	a	$	4.5	million	*U*	provision	in	the	1988	quarter	.
Old	Stone	repeated	projections	that	it	will	be	profitable	for	the	fourth	quarter	and	will	about	break	even	for	the	year	.
Abraham	Lincoln	Federal	Savings	Bank	sank	4	to	13	1\/2	after	*-2	announcing	a	shakeup	that	*T*-1	will	change	senior	management	and	reorganize	the	bank	's	mortgage	business	as	a	separate	unit	.
The	bank	also	said	0	it	will	establish	a	loan-loss	reserve	of	$	2.5	million	to	$	4	million	*U*	against	a	construction	loan	that	*T*-1	is	in	default	.
The	bank	,	which	*T*-1	previously	said	0	it	was	for	sale	,	said	0	it	has	received	no	offers	and	that	its	board	will	review	whether	*	to	continue	*-2	soliciting	bids	.
Medical	scientists	are	starting	*-2	to	uncover	a	handful	of	genes	which	*T*-3	,	if	*-4	damaged	*-5	,	unleash	the	chaotic	growth	of	cells	that	*T*-1	characterizes	cancer	.
Scientists	say	0	the	discovery	of	these	genes	in	recent	months	is	painting	a	new	and	startling	picture	of	how	cancer	develops	*T*-1	.
An	emerging	understanding	of	the	genes	is	expected	*-1	to	produce	an	array	of	new	strategies	for	future	cancer	treatment	and	prevention	.
That	is	for	the	future	.
Already	,	scientists	are	developing	tests	based	*	on	the	newly	identified	genes	that	*T*-1	,	for	the	first	time	,	can	predict	whether	an	otherwise	healthy	individual	is	likely	*-2	to	get	cancer	.
``	It	's	a	super-exciting	set	of	discoveries	,	''	says	*T*-2	Bert	Vogelstein	,	a	Johns	Hopkins	University	researcher	who	*T*-1	has	just	found	a	gene	pivotal	to	the	triggering	of	colon	cancer	.
``	Only	a	decade	ago	cancer	was	a	black	box	about	which	we	knew	nothing	*T*-1	at	the	molecular	level	.
Today	,	we	know	that	the	accumulation	of	several	of	these	altered	genes	can	initiate	a	cancer	and	,	then	,	propel	it	into	a	deadly	state	.	''
Scientists	call	the	new	class	of	genes	tumor-suppressors	,	or	simply	anti-cancer	genes	.
When	*-3	functioning	normally	*T*-2	,	they	make	proteins	that	*T*-1	hold	a	cell	's	growth	in	check	.
But	if	the	genes	are	damaged	*-1	--	perhaps	by	radiation	,	a	chemical	or	through	a	chance	accident	in	cell	division	--	their	growth-suppressing	proteins	no	longer	work	,	and	cells	normally	under	control	turn	malignant	.
The	newly	identified	genes	differ	from	a	family	of	genes	discovered	*	in	the	early	1980s	called	*	oncogenes	.
Oncogenes	must	be	present	for	a	cell	to	become	malignant	,	but	researchers	have	found	them	in	normal	*RNR*-1	as	well	as	in	cancerous	*RNR*-1	cells	,	*	suggesting	that	oncogenes	do	n't	cause	cancer	by	themselves	.
In	recent	months	,	researchers	have	come	*-2	to	believe	0	the	two	types	of	cancer	genes	work	in	concert	:	An	oncogene	may	turn	proliferating	cells	malignant	only	after	the	tumor-suppressor	gene	has	been	damaged	*-1	.
Like	all	genes	,	tumor-suppressor	genes	are	inherited	*-1	in	two	copies	,	one	from	each	parent	.
Either	copy	can	make	the	proteins	needed	*	*	to	control	cell	growth	,	so	for	cancer	to	arise	,	both	copies	must	be	impaired	.
A	person	who	*T*-3	is	born	*-1	with	one	defective	copy	of	a	suppressor	gene	,	or	in	whom	one	copy	is	damaged	*-2	early	in	life	*T*-4	,	is	especially	prone	to	cancer	because	he	need	only	*-5	lose	the	other	copy	for	a	cancer	to	develop	.
Emerging	genetic	tests	will	be	able	*-1	to	spot	such	cancer-susceptible	individuals	,	*	ushering	in	what	some	scientists	believe	0	*T*-2	is	a	new	age	of	predictive	cancer	diagnosis	.
Bill	and	Bonnie	Quinlan	are	among	the	first	beneficiaries	of	the	new	findings	.
The	Dedham	,	Mass.	,	couple	knew	even	before	Bonnie	became	pregnant	in	1987	that	any	child	of	theirs	had	a	50	%	chance	of	*	being	at	risk	for	retinoblastoma	,	an	eye	cancer	that	*T*-1	occurs	about	once	every	20,000	births	.
Mr.	Quinlan	,	30	years	old	,	knew	0	he	carried	a	damaged	gene	,	*-3	having	lost	an	eye	to	the	rare	tumor	when	he	was	only	two	months	old	*T*-1	--	after	his	mother	had	suffered	the	same	fate	when	she	was	a	baby	*T*-2	.
Because	of	the	isolation	of	the	retinoblastoma	tumor-suppressor	gene	,	it	*EXP*-1	became	possible	last	January	*	to	find	out	what	threat	the	Quinlan	baby	faced	*T*-2	.
A	test	using	new	``	genetic	probes	''	showed	that	little	Will	Quinlan	had	not	inherited	a	damaged	retinoblastoma	supressor	gene	and	,	therefore	,	faced	no	more	risk	than	other	children	of	*	developing	the	rare	cancer	.
``	It	made	our	New	Year	,	''	says	*T*-1	Mr.	Quinlan	.
This	test	was	the	first	0	*T*-2	to	predict	reliably	whether	an	individual	could	expect	*-1	to	develop	cancer	.
Equally	important	,	the	initial	discovery	of	the	gene	that	*T*-1	controls	retinal	cell	growth	,	made	*	by	a	Boston	doctor	named	*	Thaddeus	Dryja	,	has	opened	a	field	of	cancer	study	,	which	*T*-2	in	recent	months	has	exploded	.
``	It	turns	out	that	*	studying	a	tragic	but	uncommon	tumor	made	possible	some	fundamental	insights	about	the	most	basic	workings	of	cancer	,	''	says	*T*-1	Samuel	Broder	,	director	of	the	National	Cancer	Institute	.
``	All	this	may	not	be	obvious	to	the	public	,	which	*T*-1	is	concerned	about	advances	in	treatment	,	but	I	am	convinced	0	this	basic	research	will	begin	*-2	showing	results	there	soon	.	''
To	date	,	scientists	have	fingered	two	of	these	cancer-suppressors	.
Dr.	Dryja	made	his	retinoblastoma	discovery	in	1986	.
Then	last	spring	,	researchers	reported	*-2	finding	a	gene	called	*	p53	which	*T*-1	,	if	*-3	impaired	*-4	,	turns	healthy	colon	cells	cancerous	.
Soon	after	that	report	,	two	other	research	teams	uncovered	evidence	that	the	same	damaged	p53	gene	is	present	in	tissue	from	lung	and	breast	cancers	.
Colon	,	lung	and	breast	cancers	are	the	most	common	and	lethal	forms	of	the	disease	,	collectively	killing	almost	200,000	Americans	a	year	.
Right	now	about	a	dozen	laboratories	,	in	the	U.S.	,	Canada	and	Britain	,	are	racing	*-1	to	unmask	other	suspected	tumor-suppressing	genes	.
They	have	about	seven	candidates	.
Researchers	say	0	the	inactivation	of	tumor-suppressor	genes	,	alone	or	in	combination	,	appears	crucial	to	the	development	of	such	scourges	as	cancer	of	the	brain	,	the	skin	,	kidney	,	prostate	,	and	cervix	.
There	is	evidence	that	if	people	inherit	defective	versions	of	these	genes	,	they	are	especially	prone	to	cancer	,	*	perhaps	explaining	,	finally	,	why	some	cancers	seem	*-2	to	haunt	certain	families	*T*-1	.
The	story	of	tumor-suppressor	genes	goes	back	to	the	1970s	,	when	a	pediatrician	named	*	Alfred	G.	Knudson	Jr.	proposed	that	retinoblastoma	stemmed	from	two	separate	genetic	defects	*T*-1	.
He	theorized	that	in	the	eye	cancer	,	an	infant	inherited	a	damaged	copy	of	a	gene	from	one	parent	and	a	normal	copy	from	the	other	.
The	tumor	,	he	suggested	0	*T*-2	,	developed	when	the	second	,	normal	copy	also	was	damaged	*-1	*T*-3	.
But	there	was	no	way	0	*	to	prove	Dr.	Knudson	's	``	two-hit	''	theory	*T*-1	.
Back	then	,	scientists	had	no	way	of	*	ferreting	out	specific	genes	,	but	under	a	microscope	they	could	see	the	23	pairs	of	chromosomes	in	the	cells	that	*T*-1	contain	the	genes	.
Occasionally	,	gross	chromosome	damage	was	visible	.
Dr.	Knudson	found	that	some	children	with	the	eye	cancer	had	inherited	a	damaged	copy	of	chromosome	No.	13	from	a	parent	who	*T*-1	had	had	the	disease	.
Under	a	microscope	he	could	actually	see	that	a	bit	of	chromosome	13	was	missing	.
He	assumed	0	the	missing	piece	contained	a	gene	or	genes	whose	loss	*T*-1	had	a	critical	role	in	*	setting	off	the	cancer	.
But	he	did	n't	know	which	gene	or	genes	*T*-1	had	disappeared	.
Then	,	a	scientific	team	led	*	by	molecular	geneticist	Webster	Cavenee	,	then	at	the	University	of	Utah	,	found	the	answer	.
The	team	used	a	battery	of	the	newly	developed	``	gene	probes	,	''	snippets	of	genetic	material	that	*T*-1	can	track	a	gene	's	presence	in	a	cell	.
By	*-1	analyzing	cells	extracted	*	from	eye	tumors	,	they	found	defects	in	the	second	copy	of	chromosome	13	in	the	exact	area	as	in	the	first	copy	of	the	chromosome	.
The	finding	riveted	medicine	.
It	was	the	first	time	0	anyone	had	showed	that	the	loss	of	both	copies	of	the	same	gene	could	lead	to	the	eruption	of	a	cancer	*T*-1	.
``	It	was	extraordinarily	satisfying	,	''	says	*T*-1	Dr.	Knudson	,	now	at	Fox	Chase	Cancer	Research	Center	in	Philadelphia	.
``	I	was	convinced	that	what	*T*-1	was	true	of	retinoblastoma	would	be	true	for	all	cancers	.	''
It	was	an	audacious	claim	.
But	in	Baltimore	,	Dr.	Vogelstein	,	a	young	molecular	biologist	at	Johns	Hopkins	Medical	School	,	believed	0	Dr.	Knudson	was	right	,	and	set	out	*-1	to	repeat	the	Cavenee	experiment	in	cells	from	other	cancers	.
His	was	one	of	two	research	teams	in	1984	0	*T*-2	to	report	dual	chromosome	losses	for	a	rare	childhood	cancer	of	the	kidney	called	*	Wilm	's	tumor	.
Dr.	Vogelstein	next	turned	his	attention	to	colon	cancer	,	the	second	biggest	cancer	killer	in	the	U.S.	after	lung	cancer	.
He	believed	0	colon	cancer	might	also	arise	from	multiple	``	hits	''	on	cancer	suppressor	genes	,	because	it	often	seems	*-1	to	develop	in	stages	.
It	often	is	preceded	*-1	by	the	development	of	polyps	in	the	bowel	,	which	*T*-2	in	some	cases	become	increasingly	malignant	in	identifiable	stages	--	*-3	progressing	from	less	severe	to	deadly	--	as	though	a	cascade	of	genetic	damage	might	be	occurring	.
Dr.	Vogelstein	and	a	doctoral	student	,	Eric	Fearon	,	began	months	of	tedious	and	often	frustrating	probing	of	the	chromosomes	*-1	searching	for	signs	of	genetic	damage	.
They	began	*-1	uncovering	a	confusing	variety	of	genetic	deletions	,	some	existing	only	in	benign	polyps	,	others	in	malignant	cells	and	many	in	both	polyps	and	malignant	cells	.
Gradually	,	a	coherent	picture	of	cancer	development	emerged	.
If	both	copies	of	a	certain	gene	were	knocked	out	,	benign	polyps	would	develop	.
If	both	copies	of	a	second	gene	were	then	deleted	*-1	,	the	polyps	would	progress	to	malignancy	.
It	*EXP*-3	was	clear	that	more	than	one	gene	had	*-2	to	be	damaged	*-1	for	colon	cancer	to	develop	.
Their	report	galvanized	other	molecular	biologists	.
``	It	was	the	confirming	evidence	*ICH*-2	0	we	all	needed	*T*-1	that	-LCB-	gene	-RCB-	losses	were	critical	to	the	development	of	a	common	tumor	,	''	says	*T*-3	Ray	White	at	Howard	Hughes	Medical	Institute	in	Salt	Lake	City	.
But	Dr.	Vogelstein	had	yet	*-2	to	nail	the	identity	of	the	gene	that	*T*-1	,	if	*-3	damaged	*-4	,	flipped	a	colon	cell	into	full-blown	malignancy	.
They	focused	on	chromosome	17	.
For	months	the	Johns	Hopkins	researchers	,	*-1	using	gene	probes	,	experimentally	crawled	down	the	length	of	chromosome	17	,	*-1	looking	for	the	smallest	common	bit	of	genetic	material	lost	*	in	all	tumor	cells	.
Such	a	piece	of	DNA	would	probably	constitute	a	gene	.
When	they	found	it	last	winter	*T*-1	,	Dr.	Vogelstein	was	dubious	that	the	search	was	over	.
His	doubts	stemmed	from	the	fact	that	several	years	earlier	a	Princeton	University	researcher	,	Arnold	Levine	,	had	found	in	experiments	with	mice	that	a	gene	called	*	p53	could	transform	normal	cells	into	cancerous	ones	.
The	deletion	0	Dr.	Vogelstein	found	*T*-1	was	in	exactly	the	same	spot	as	p53	.
But	Mr.	Levine	had	said	0	the	p53	gene	caused	cancer	by	*-2	promoting	growth	,	whereas	the	Johns	Hopkins	scientists	were	looking	for	a	gene	that	*T*-1	suppressed	growth	.
Despite	that	,	when	the	Johns	Hopkins	scientists	compared	the	gene	0	they	had	found	*T*-2	in	the	human	cancer	cells	with	the	Mr.	Levine	's	p53	gene	*T*-1	they	found	0	the	two	were	identical	;	it	turned	out	that	in	Mr.	Levine	's	cancer	studies	,	he	had	unknowingly	been	observing	a	damaged	form	of	p53	--	a	cancer-suppressing	gene	.
The	discovery	``	suddenly	puts	an	obscure	gene	right	in	the	cockpit	of	cancer	formation	,	''	says	0	*T*-1	Robert	Weinberg	,	a	leader	in	cancer-gene	research	at	Whitehead	Institute	in	Cambridge	,	Mass	.
Evidence	*ICH*-2	now	is	emerging	that	the	p53	suppressor	gene	is	involved	in	other	cancers	,	too	.
Researchers	in	Edinburgh	,	Scotland	,	have	found	that	in	23	of	38	breast	tumors	,	one	copy	of	chromosome	17	was	mutated	*-1	at	the	spot	where	gene	p53	lies	*T*-2	.
The	scientists	say	that	since	breast	cancer	often	strikes	multiple	members	of	certain	families	,	the	gene	,	when	*	inherited	in	a	damaged	form	*T*-1	,	may	predispose	women	to	the	cancer	.
The	p53	gene	has	just	been	implicated	*-1	in	lung	cancer	.
In	a	report	out	last	week	,	John	Minna	and	colleagues	at	the	National	Cancer	Institute	say	that	about	half	the	cells	taken	*	from	lung	cancer	tissue	0	they	tested	*T*-1	are	missing	this	gene	.
There	also	are	reports	from	several	labs	,	as	yet	unpublished	*	,	of	missing	p53	genes	in	tissue	taken	*	from	kidney	,	brain	and	skin	cancers	.
At	the	same	time	,	the	Johns	Hopkins	team	and	others	are	rushing	*-1	to	pinpoint	other	tumor-suppressor	genes	.
Dr.	Vogelstein	hopes	*-1	soon	to	isolate	one	on	chromosome	18	,	also	involved	in	colon	cancer	.
Ray	White	in	Utah	and	Walter	Bodmer	,	a	researcher	in	Great	Britain	,	are	close	to	*-1	finding	another	gene	involved	with	some	types	of	colon	cancer	,	thought	*	to	be	on	chromosome	5	.
Dr.	Minna	believes	0	people	who	*T*-1	inherit	a	defective	gene	somewhere	on	one	of	their	two	copies	of	chromosome	3	are	especially	prone	to	lung	cancer	.
Recently	,	he	and	others	reported	that	the	retinoblastoma	suppressor	gene	may	also	be	involved	in	some	lung	cancers	,	as	well	as	several	other	more	common	cancers	,	too	.
Where	these	discoveries	will	lead	*T*-1	,	scientists	can	only	speculate	*T*-2	.
Already	two	major	pharmaceutical	companies	,	the	Squibb	unit	of	Bristol-Myers	Squibb	Co.	and	Hoffmann-La	Roche	Inc.	,	are	collaborating	with	gene	hunters	*-1	to	turn	the	anticipated	cascade	of	discoveries	into	predictive	tests	and	,	maybe	,	new	therapies	.
Some	researchers	say	0	new	cancer	drugs	0	*T*-1	to	slow	or	reverse	tumor	growth	may	be	based	*-2	on	the	suppressor	proteins	normally	produced	*	by	the	genes	.
The	idea	would	be	*	to	administer	to	patients	the	growth-controlling	proteins	made	*	by	healthy	versions	of	the	damaged	genes	.
It	*EXP*-1	may	even	be	possible	*	to	replace	defective	genes	with	healthy	versions	,	though	no	one	has	come	close	*-2	to	doing	that	so	far	.
In	any	case	,	says	0	*T*-1	Dr.	Minna	of	the	National	Cancer	Institute	,	``	We	're	witnessing	the	discovery	of	one	of	the	most	important	steps	in	the	genesis	of	cancer	.
Many	investors	give	Michael	Foods	about	as	much	chance	of	*	getting	it	together	as	Humpty	Dumpty	.
But	now	at	least	there	's	a	glimmer	of	hope	for	the	stock	.
Burger	King	,	which	*T*-1	breaks	thousands	of	fresh	eggs	each	morning	,	is	quietly	switching	over	to	an	alternative	egg	product	made	*	by	Michael	Foods	.
*-2	Known	*-1	as	Easy	Eggs	,	the	product	has	disappointed	investors	.
When	the	company	this	month	announced	lower-than-forecast	sales	of	Easy	Eggs	*T*-1	,	the	stock	dropped	nearly	19	%	.
Michael	wo	n't	confirm	the	identities	of	any	Easy	Egg	customers	,	nor	will	it	say	much	of	anything	else	.
Two	Minneapolis	shareholder	suits	in	the	past	month	have	accused	top	officers	of	*-1	making	``	various	untrue	statements	.	''
These	federal-court	suits	accuse	the	officers	of	*-2	failing	*-3	to	disclose	that	Easy	Eggs	were	unlikely	*-1	to	sell	briskly	enough	*	to	justify	all	of	Michael	's	production	capacity	.
But	at	least	Burger	King	has	signed	on	,	and	says	that	by	year	end	it	wo	n't	be	using	any	shell	eggs	.
The	Miami	fast-food	chain	,	owned	*	by	Grand	Metropolitan	of	Britain	,	expects	*-1	to	consume	roughly	34	million	pounds	of	liquefied	eggs	annually	.
So	there	is	reason	0	*	to	believe	that	Michael	's	hopes	for	a	bacteria-free	,	long-shelf-life	egg	were	n't	all	hype	*T*-1	.
-LRB-	Easy	Eggs	are	pasteurized	*-1	in	a	heat-using	process	.	-RRB-
Still	,	caution	is	advisable	.
A	company	official	says	0	Michael	's	break-even	volume	on	Easy	Eggs	is	around	60	million	pounds	a	year	--	apparently	well	above	current	shipments	and	a	far	cry	from	what	the	company	once	suggested	0	*T*-1	was	a	billion-pound	market	waiting	for	such	a	product	.
Perhaps	*	to	debunk	the	analysts	'	talk	of	over-capacity	,	Michael	today	will	take	some	of	the	skeptics	on	a	tour	of	its	new	Gaylord	,	Minn.	,	plant	.
There	has	been	no	announcement	of	the	Burger	King	arrangement	by	either	party	,	possibly	for	fear	that	McDonald	's	and	other	fast-food	rivals	would	seize	on	it	in	scornful	advertising	.
But	Burger	King	operators	independently	confirm	*-1	using	Michael	's	product	.
Other	institutional	users	reportedly	include	Marriott	,	which	*T*-1	is	moving	away	from	fresh	eggs	on	a	region-by-region	basis	.
The	extent	of	Marriott	's	use	is	n't	known	,	and	Marriott	officials	could	n't	be	reached	*-1	for	comment	.
Michael	Foods	has	attracted	a	good	many	short-sellers	,	the	people	who	*T*-1	sell	borrowed	shares	in	a	bet	that	a	stock	price	will	drop	and	allow	the	return	of	cheaper	shares	to	the	lender	.
Many	analysts	question	management	's	credibility	.
``	The	stock	,	in	my	opinion	,	is	going	*-2	to	go	lower	,	not	only	because	of	disappointing	earnings	but	-LCB-	because	-RCB-	the	credibility	gap	is	certainly	not	closing	,	''	says	*T*-1	L.	Craig	Carver	of	Dain	Bosworth	.
Mr.	Carver	says	that	at	a	recent	Dain-sponsored	conference	in	New	York	,	he	asked	Michael	's	chief	executive	officer	if	the	fourth	quarter	would	be	down	.
The	CEO	,	Richard	G.	Olson	,	replied	``	yes	,	''	but	would	n't	elaborate	.
-LRB-	The	company	did	n't	put	out	a	public	announcement	.
A	spokesman	said	later	that	Mr.	Olson	was	being	``	conservative	''	in	his	estimate	.
But	the	spokesman	added	that	while	Michael	will	earn	less	than	last	year	's	$	1.20	*U*	a	share	,	it	thinks	0	Street	estimates	of	$	1	*U*	or	so	are	low	.	-RRB-
Analyst	Robin	Young	of	John	Kinnard	&	Co.	,	Minneapolis	,	calls	himself	``	the	last	remaining	bull	on	the	stock	.	''
He	argues	that	Michael	Foods	is	misunderstood	:	``	This	is	a	growth	company	in	the	packaged	food	industry	--	a	rare	breed	,	like	*	finding	a	white	rhino	.	''
Earnings	are	n't	keeping	pace	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	,	because	of	heavy	investments	in	the	egg	technologies	and	drought-related	costs	in	its	potato	business	.
Mr.	Carver	,	however	,	believes	0	the	company	's	egg	product	wo	n't	help	the	bottom	line	in	the	short	run	,	even	though	it	``	makes	sense	--	it	's	more	convenient	''	and	justifies	its	price	,	which	*T*-1	is	higher	than	shell	eggs	,	because	of	health	and	sanitation	concerns	.
Prospective	competition	is	one	problem	.
Last	week	a	closely	held	New	Jersey	concern	,	Papetti	High-Grade	Egg	Products	Co.	,	rolled	out	an	aseptically	packaged	liquefied	item	called	*	Table	Ready	.
Company	President	Steve	Papetti	says	0	Marriott	will	be	among	his	clients	as	well	.
Michael	shares	closed	at	13	3\/4	yesterday	in	national	over-the-counter	trading	.

Michael	late	yesterday	announced	a	$	3.8	million	*U*	stock	buy-back	program	.
Michael	,	which	*T*-1	also	processes	potatoes	,	still	relies	on	spuds	for	about	a	fourth	of	its	sales	and	nearly	half	its	pretax	profit	.
But	dry	growing	conditions	in	the	Red	River	Valley	of	Minnesota	and	North	Dakota	are	pushing	spot	prices	of	potatoes	beyond	what	Michael	contracted	*-2	to	pay	*T*-1	last	spring	.
Company	lawyers	recently	sent	letters	to	growers	*	saying	that	Michael	``	would	take	very	seriously	any	effort	...	*	to	divert	its	contracted-for	potatoes	to	other	outlets	.	''
Still	,	analysts	believe	that	profit	margins	in	the	potato	business	will	be	down	again	this	year	.
Pierre	Peladeau	,	a	Canadian	newspaper	publisher	little-known	in	the	U.S.	,	figures	*-1	to	become	a	big	player	in	North	American	printing	--	and	his	ambitions	do	n't	end	there	.
Yesterday	,	Quebecor	Inc.	,	a	Montreal	printing	,	publishing	and	forest-products	company	53%-owned	by	Mr.	Peladeau	,	agreed	*-1	to	acquire	Maxwell	Communication	Corp.	's	U.S.	printing	subsidiary	,	Maxwell	Graphics	Inc.	,	for	$	500	million	*U*	in	cash	and	securities	.
The	purchase	,	expected	*	to	be	completed	*-1	by	year	end	,	will	make	Quebecor	the	second-largest	commercial	printer	in	North	America	,	behind	only	R.R.	Donnelley	&	Sons	Co.	,	Chicago	.
The	printing	customers	that	Quebecor	will	gain	*T*-1	through	Maxwell	Graphics	include	the	Sunday	newspaper	supplement	Parade	,	Time	,	Sports	Illustrated	and	TV	Guide	.
But	the	transaction	is	just	Mr.	Peladeau	's	latest	step	in	a	larger	design	:	*	to	build	Quebecor	through	acquisitions	into	an	integrated	paper	,	publishing	and	printing	concern	with	a	reach	throughout	North	America	.
He	already	has	achieved	vertical	integration	on	a	limited	scale	:	Quebecor	can	put	a	weekly	newspaper	on	almost	any	Quebec	doorstep	without	*-1	using	outside	help	,	from	*	chopping	down	the	tree	to	*	making	the	newsprint	to	*	flinging	it	up	onto	the	porch	.
Analysts	say	0	Quebecor	's	purchase	is	part	of	a	trend	toward	consolidation	in	the	North	American	printing	industry	.
Along	with	Donnelley	,	says	0	*T*-1	Jacques	Massicotte	,	an	analyst	with	Nesbitt	Thomson	Deacon	Inc.	in	Montreal	,	``	Quebecor	has	positioned	itself	as	one	of	the	two	key	players	.	''
He	adds	:	``	I	think	0	this	is	a	great	strategic	move	for	Quebecor	.
They	are	buying	an	operation	that	*T*-1	is	running	well	.	''
Mr.	Peladeau	says	0	he	is	n't	trying	*-2	to	catch	up	to	Donnelley	,	which	*T*-1	has	annual	sales	of	over	$	3	billion	*U*	.
``	Size	does	n't	matter	,	''	Mr.	Peladeau	says	*T*-1	.
``	What	*T*-1	counts	is	*T*-2	the	bottom	line	.	''
Some	of	Mr.	Peladeau	's	ventures	,	including	an	earlier	push	into	the	U.S.	market	,	have	n't	paid	off	on	the	bottom	line	.
Quebecor	started	the	Philadelphia	Journal	,	a	daily	tabloid	,	in	1977	and	closed	it	three	years	later	.
The	venture	cost	Quebecor	$	12	million	*U*	,	Mr.	Peladeau	says	0	*T*-1	.
More	recently	,	some	former	Quebecor	executives	started	their	own	printing	company	,	*	specializing	in	*	printing	and	distributing	advertising	circulars	.
Quebecor	still	lags	in	the	Quebec	circulars	market	,	while	Mr.	Peladeau	's	former	employees	are	expanding	across	Canada	.
Mr.	Peladeau	took	his	first	big	gamble	25	years	ago	,	when	he	took	advantage	of	a	strike	at	La	Presse	,	then	Montreal	's	dominant	French-language	newspaper	,	*-2	to	launch	the	Journal	de	Montreal	*T*-1	.
The	tabloid	's	circulation	soared	to	80,000	,	but	plunged	to	under	10,000	when	the	La	Presse	strike	ended	*T*-1	.
Still	,	Mr.	Peladeau	stuck	with	the	venture	.
Now	the	Journal	,	*-1	flush	with	ads	and	hugely	profitable	,	is	even	with	La	Presse	in	weekend	circulation	and	outsells	it	3	to	2	every	weekday	.
Mr.	Peladeau	has	never	made	any	apologies	for	*	publishing	the	tabloid	,	a	brash	mix	of	crime	and	sports	.
``	I	've	read	Balzac	,	''	he	answers	critics	*T*-1	.
``	It	's	tabloid	news	from	A	to	Z	.	''
Quebecor	also	publishes	a	second	tabloid	in	Montreal	,	the	struggling	18-month-old	Montreal	Daily	News	;	dailies	in	Quebec	City	and	Winnipeg	,	Manitoba	;	and	dozens	of	weeklies	covering	most	of	Quebec	.
A	series	of	recent	acquisitions	made	it	the	dominant	magazine	publisher	in	Quebec	.
After	a	recent	merger	,	it	is	also	the	only	province-wide	distributor	of	magazines	and	newspapers	in	Quebec	.
Finally	,	with	Maxwell	Communication	,	the	company	controls	54	%	of	Donohue	Inc.	,	a	Quebec	City	pulp	and	paper	concern	.
In	yesterday	's	accord	,	Quebecor	agreed	*-1	to	pay	$	400	million	*U*	in	cash	for	Maxwell	Graphics	,	and	to	give	Maxwell	Communication	a	20	%	stake	,	valued	*	at	$	100	million	*U*	,	in	Quebecor	's	new	printing	subsidiary	.
The	new	,	as	yet	unnamed	,	subsidiary	will	combine	Quebecor	's	existing	printing	unit	and	Maxwell	Graphics	.
It	will	have	61	plants	from	coast	to	coast	and	$	1.5	billion	*U*	in	annual	sales	.
Quebecor	will	own	57.5	%	of	the	new	subsidiary	.
Caisse	de	Depot	et	Placement	,	the	Quebec	government	pension-fund	agency	,	will	pay	$	112.5	million	*U*	for	the	remaining	22.5	%	stake	in	the	printing	operation	.
Pierre-Karl	Peladeau	,	the	founder	's	son	and	the	executive	in	charge	of	the	acquisition	,	says	0	Quebecor	has	n't	decided	how	it	will	finance	its	share	of	the	purchase	*T*-1	,	but	he	says	0	it	most	likely	will	use	debt	.
The	Maxwell	deal	is	Quebecor	's	second	big	printing	acquisition	in	just	over	a	year	.
Last	October	,	Quebecor	bought	23	Canadian	printing	plants	from	BCE	Inc.	,	a	Montreal	telecommunications	,	manufacturing	,	energy	and	real	estate	company	.
That	purchase	doubled	Quebecor	's	annual	printing	revenue	to	$	750	million	*U*	.
Maxwell	's	sale	of	its	U.S.	printing	unit	*ICH*-4	was	expected	*-1	,	the	last	major	business	0	*T*-2	to	be	disposed	of	*-3	in	a	major	reshuffling	of	assets	.
According	to	its	most	recent	annual	report	,	covering	the	15	months	ended	March	31	,	Maxwell	Communication	bought	$	3.85	billion	*U*	in	assets	--	including	Macmillan	Inc.	and	Official	Airlines	Guides	--	and	sold	$	2	billion	*U*	in	non-strategic	businesses	.
Now	,	Maxwell	founder	Robert	Maxwell	says	0	he	has	an	appetite	for	new	acquisitions	in	the	U.S.	,	*-1	adding	that	he	could	spend	``	a	good	deal	more	''	than	$	1	billion	*U*	on	another	U.S.	purchase	.
In	London	trading	yesterday	,	Maxwell	Communication	shares	rose	nine	pence	,	to	216	pence	-LRB-	$	3.41	*U*	-RRB-	.
In	Montreal	,	Quebecor	's	multiple	voting	Class	A	stock	closed	at	C$	16.375	*U*	-LRB-	US$	13.94	*U*	-RRB-	,	down	12.5	Canadian	cents	.
Quebecor	Class	B	stock	closed	at	C$	15.375	*U*	,	up	62.5	Canadian	cents	.
Craig	Forman	in	London	contributed	to	this	article	.
G.D.	Searle	&	Co.	said	0	the	Food	and	Drug	Administration	approved	the	sale	of	Kerlone	,	a	hypertension	drug	developed	*	by	a	joint	venture	between	Searle	and	a	French	concern	.
Searle	,	a	unit	of	Monsanto	Co.	,	said	0	the	``	beta-blocker	''	high-blood-pressure	drug	Kerlone	is	the	first	product	0	*T*-1	to	reach	the	market	through	Lorex	Pharmaceuticals	,	the	U.S.	company	jointly	owned	*	by	Searle	and	Synthelabo	,	a	French	pharmaceutical	concern	owned	*	by	France	's	L'Oreal	S.A	.
The	U.S.	Equal	Employment	Opportunity	Commission	sued	New	York	state	for	age	discrimination	against	appointed	state	judges	.
The	suit	,	filed	*	in	federal	court	in	Manhattan	,	charges	that	New	York	's	mandatory	retirement	age	of	76	violates	federal	law	.
Separately	,	the	commission	intervened	in	a	Connecticut	state	judge	's	age-bias	suit	in	federal	court	in	New	Haven	.
The	commission	's	filing	in	that	case	challenges	Connecticut	's	mandatory	retirement	age	of	70	for	appointed	judges	.
The	New	York	suit	was	filed	*-1	on	behalf	of	Justice	Isaac	Rubin	,	whose	appointment	to	the	state	appellate	division	*T*-2	expires	at	year	end	,	and	all	other	judges	hurt	*	by	the	alleged	age	discrimination	.
The	suit	,	assigned	*	to	federal	Judge	Kimba	Wood	,	seeks	a	permanent	injunction	,	back	pay	for	judges	who	*T*-1	have	been	forced	*-2	to	retire	,	reinstatement	of	retired	judges	and	``	other	affirmative	relief	necessary	*	to	eradicate	the	effects	of	-LRB-	New	York	's	-RRB-	unlawful	employment	practices	.	''
Justice	Rubin	,	a	state	judge	since	1969	,	said	0	the	mandatory-retirement	age	hurts	the	court	system	because	it	deprives	the	state	of	experienced	judges	still	capable	of	*	serving	on	the	bench	.
``	The	issue	is	n't	age	--	age	is	just	a	number	.
The	issue	is	one	of	a	judge	's	experience	,	his	competence	and	his	physical	ability	*	to	serve	on	the	bench	,	''	Justice	Rubin	said	*T*-1	.
``	I	've	had	no	problems	*	performing	my	duties	and	responsibilities	.	''
Because	Justice	Rubin	turned	76	on	May	9	,	he	is	n't	eligible	*-2	to	be	reappointed	*-1	to	the	bench	at	the	end	of	the	year	.
The	suit	's	impact	on	New	York	may	be	narrow	,	however	.
Most	New	York	judges	are	elected	*-1	,	and	the	federal	age-discrimination	law	does	n't	apply	to	elected	officials	,	said	0	*T*-2	James	L.	Lee	,	regional	attorney	for	the	EEOC	in	New	York	.
Under	New	York	law	,	elected	judges	must	retire	at	age	70	,	but	then	can	be	appointed	*-1	to	two-year	terms	until	they	reach	76	.
A	spokeswoman	for	the	state	's	Office	of	Court	Administration	declined	*-1	to	comment	on	the	suit	.
But	she	said	0	the	state	currently	has	35	appointed	judges	who	*T*-1	are	over	70	.
In	Connecticut	,	however	,	most	state	judges	are	appointed	*-1	by	the	governor	and	approved	*-1	by	the	state	legislature	.
The	parties	in	the	Connecticut	case	have	agreed	*-1	to	stay	proceedings	pending	the	appeal	of	another	EEOC	age-bias	case	against	Vermont	.
In	the	Vermont	case	,	a	federal	judge	ruled	that	the	state	's	mandatory	age	of	70	for	appointed	judges	was	illegal	;	Vermont	's	appeal	of	that	decision	is	pending	before	the	U.S.	Second	Circuit	Court	of	Appeals	in	Manhattan	.
Aaron	Ment	,	Connecticut	's	chief	court	administrator	,	declined	*-1	to	comment	on	the	suit	and	the	EEOC	's	intervention	.
He	said	0	the	state	has	165	appointed	judges	and	15	``	trial	referees	,	''	who	*T*-1	are	former	judges	over	age	70	and	serve	a	restricted	role	on	the	bench	.
ORGANIZED	CRIME	Strike	Forces	likely	*-2	to	be	abolished	*-1	next	month	.
U.S.	Attorney	General	Dick	Thornburgh	's	plan	*	to	dissolve	the	14	regional	organized-crime	strike	forces	is	expected	*-1	to	go	into	effect	next	month	,	despite	the	opposition	of	Democratic	congressional	leaders	and	lawyers	in	the	special	units	.
The	units	are	autonomous	from	U.S.	attorneys	'	offices	and	focus	exclusively	on	*	prosecuting	organized-crime	cases	.
In	February	,	Mr.	Thornburgh	announced	his	plan	*	to	abolish	the	units	.
He	says	0	the	strike-force	lawyers	will	work	more	efficiently	under	the	supervision	of	U.S.	attorneys	.
Mr.	Thornburgh	will	be	free	*-1	to	disband	the	strike	forces	after	Congress	approves	a	$	479	million	*U*	appropriation	for	federal	law-enforcement	and	drug-interdiction	agencies	,	according	to	David	Runkel	,	a	Justice	Department	spokesman	.
The	bill	is	expected	*-1	to	pass	in	Congress	next	month	.
Congress	temporarily	halted	Mr.	Thornburgh	's	effort	with	an	appropriation	resolution	that	*T*-1	prohibited	him	from	*-2	using	budgeted	funds	*-3	to	implement	his	plan	.
Opponents	say	0	Mr.	Thornburgh	's	plan	will	needlessly	break	up	longtime	,	tightly	knit	crime-fighting	units	that	*T*-1	have	successfully	prosecuted	major	organized-crime	figures	.
They	predict	that	organized-crime	activity	will	increase	once	the	units	are	dissolved	*-1	and	their	responsibilities	transferred	*-3	to	U.S.	attorneys	'	offices	.
Some	former	strike-force	personnel	say	0	the	units	have	already	begun	*-1	to	break	up	.
The	Eastern	District	unit	in	Brooklyn	,	N.Y.	,	lost	seven	of	its	15	attorneys	this	year	partly	because	the	lawyers	were	troubled	*-1	by	the	proposed	reorganization	,	says	0	*T*-3	Laura	A.	Brevetti	,	who	*T*-2	left	the	strike	force	*-4	to	join	Morrison	Cohen	Singer	&	Weinstein	,	a	New	York	law	firm	.
``	Those	who	*T*-1	have	left	have	expressed	an	opinion	that	the	strike	force	should	continue	,	''	Ms.	Brevetti	says	*T*-2	.
But	Mr.	Runkel	contends	0	there	has	been	no	exodus	of	strike-force	lawyers	.
He	says	0	27	lawyers	have	left	and	21	have	been	hired	*-1	since	Mr.	Thornburgh	announced	his	plan	.
At	the	time	0	the	plan	was	announced	*-1	*T*-2	,	there	were	135	lawyers	.
Some	congressional	leaders	intend	*-1	to	continue	*-2	to	fight	for	independent	strike	forces	.
A	spokesman	for	Sen.	Edward	M.	Kennedy	-LRB-	D.	,	Mass	.	-RRB-	says	0	Mr.	Thornburgh	would	be	required	*-2	to	reinstate	the	units	next	year	if	an	proposed	omnibus	crime	bill	is	passed	*-1	.
Among	other	things	,	the	bill	calls	for	a	reorganization	of	the	Justice	Department	.
The	Senate	is	expected	*-1	to	consider	the	bill	shortly	,	says	0	*T*-2	the	senator	's	spokesman	.
Mr.	Runkel	says	0	he	doubts	0	Mr.	Kennedy	can	muster	enough	congressional	support	*	to	reorganize	the	Justice	Department	.
``	We	will	vigorously	oppose	the	bill	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	I	do	n't	think	0	-LRB-	the	reorganization	is	-RRB-	going	*-1	to	happen	.	''
WHITMAN	&	RANSOM	recruits	lawyers	from	disbanding	firm	:
The	204-lawyer	New	York	firm	will	bring	in	at	least	12	partners	and	a	not	yet	determined	number	of	associates	from	Golenbock	&	Barell	,	which	*T*-1	will	dissolve	Dec.	31	.
Golenbock	,	with	35	lawyers	,	has	lost	several	partners	during	the	past	year	.
Some	Golenbock	lawyers	wo	n't	be	invited	*-1	*-2	to	join	Whitman	&	Ransom	,	according	to	partners	at	both	firms	.
Whitman	&	Ransom	managing	partner	Maged	F.	Riad	said	0	the	Golenbock	recruits	will	enhance	the	firm	's	corporate	and	litigation	departments	.
SHORT	SKIRTS	not	welcome	in	Texas	court	:
Shelly	Hancock	,	a	male	county	court	judge	in	Houston	,	refused	*-1	to	let	a	woman	plead	guilty	to	a	drunk-driving	charge	because	her	skirt	stopped	three	inches	above	her	knees	.
The	woman	appeared	in	court	Thursday	*-3	to	enter	her	plea	,	but	when	she	started	*-4	to	approach	the	bench	*T*-2	,	she	was	stopped	*-1	by	Judge	Hancock	.
He	told	the	woman	's	lawyer	,	Victor	Blaine	,	that	the	short	skirt	was	inappropriate	for	a	court	appearance	.
Despite	Mr.	Blaine	's	protests	,	the	judge	rescheduled	her	case	for	Nov.	27	.
Kelly	Siegler	,	an	assistant	district	attorney	who	*T*-1	was	in	the	courtroom	,	disputed	suggestions	0	the	action	was	sexist	,	*-2	saying	0	she	had	seen	Judge	Hancock	turn	away	male	defendants	dressed	*	in	shorts	,	tank	tops	or	muscle	shirts	``	many	times	.	''
Judge	Hancock	did	n't	return	phone	calls	.
Warner	Communications	Inc.	and	Sony	Corp.	resumed	settlement	talks	on	their	legal	battle	over	Hollywood	producers	Peter	Guber	and	Jon	Peters	,	but	continued	*-1	to	level	strong	accusations	at	each	other	in	legal	documents	.
Warner	has	filed	a	$	1	billion	*U*	breach	of	contract	suit	in	Los	Angeles	Superior	Court	against	Sony	and	the	Guber-Peters	duo	,	who	*T*-1	in	turn	are	countersuing	Warner	for	*-3	trying	*-2	to	interfere	in	Sony	's	acquisition	of	Columbia	Pictures	Entertainment	Inc.	and	Guber	Peters	Entertainment	Co.	in	two	transactions	valued	*	at	over	$	5	billion	*U*	.
Although	settlement	talks	had	been	dropped	*-1	,	attorneys	for	the	two	sides	apparently	began	*-5	talking	again	yesterday	in	an	attempt	*	to	settle	the	matter	before	Thursday	,	when	a	judge	is	expected	*-3	to	rule	on	Warner	's	request	for	an	injunction	that	*T*-2	would	block	the	two	producers	from	*-6	taking	over	the	management	of	Columbia	*T*-4	.
Yesterday	,	in	documents	filed	*	in	connection	with	that	case	,	Warner	accused	Sony	officials	of	*-2	falsely	claiming	that	they	never	read	the	five-year	contract	requiring	the	two	producers	to	make	movies	exclusively	for	Columbia	,	*-3	citing	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	filings	made	*	by	Sony	that	*T*-1	described	the	contracts	.
Warner	was	referring	to	documents	filed	*	last	week	in	which	Sony	Corp.	of	America	Vice	Chairman	Michael	Schulof	and	Walter	Yetnikoff	,	president	of	its	CBS	Records	unit	,	said	0	they	had	taken	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	at	their	word	when	the	producers	told	them	that	*	getting	out	of	the	contract	would	be	no	problem	because	of	a	previous	oral	agreement	*T*-2	*T*-1	.
Wayne	Smith	,	an	attorney	at	Gibson	,	Dunn	&	Crutcher	in	Los	Angeles	representing	Sony	,	said	0	the	Sony	executives	had	n't	seen	the	contract	because	``	it	was	n't	relevant	once	Guber	and	Peters	told	them	0	Warner	would	let	them	terminate	it	at	any	time	.	''
Mr.	Smith	said	0	statements	about	the	contract	made	*	in	SEC	filings	were	made	*-1	by	attorneys	who	*T*-2	did	have	access	to	the	contracts	but	who	*T*-3	were	n't	part	of	the	negotiations	between	Sony	and	the	duo	.
Warner	executives	also	filed	new	sworn	affidavits	denying	claims	*ICH*-2	by	Messrs.	Guber	and	Peters	that	the	two	sides	had	an	oral	agreement	that	*T*-1	enabled	the	producers	to	terminate	their	contract	with	Warner	should	the	opportunity	*	to	run	a	major	studio	come	up	.
But	Mr.	Smith	said	0	Sony	intends	*-1	to	prove	that	the	oral	agreement	did	in	fact	exist	,	and	that	even	the	existing	written	contract	does	n't	preclude	the	producers	from	*-2	taking	executive	posts	at	another	studio	.
Warner	described	as	``	nonsense	''	yesterday	Sony	's	assertions	*ICH*-1	in	prior	court	filings	that	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	could	in	theory	run	Columbia	while	*-2	still	fulfilling	their	contract	*	to	produce	movies	for	Warner	.
Such	a	dual	role	would	be	``	impractical	and	unethical	,	''	Warner	said	0	*T*-1	,	*-2	adding	,	``	that	concept	is	as	silly	as	*	suggesting	that	the	head	coach	of	the	Los	Angeles	Dodgers	could	simultaneously	be	general	manager	of	the	San	Francisco	Giants	.	''
Warner	,	which	*T*-2	is	in	the	process	of	*	being	acquired	*-1	by	New	York-based	Time	Warner	Inc.	,	also	said	0	it	paid	the	two	producers	a	fixed	annual	salary	of	$	3	million	*U*	.
Dataproducts	Inc.	said	0	it	filed	a	lawsuit	in	Delaware	Chancery	Court	*-1	to	block	a	tender	offer	by	DPC	Acquisition	Partners	,	*-1	alleging	that	the	hostile	offer	violates	a	standstill	agreement	between	the	two	concerns	.
DPC	,	an	investor	group	led	*	by	New	York-based	Crescott	Investment	Associates	,	had	itself	filed	a	suit	in	state	court	in	Los	Angeles	*-1	seeking	*-2	to	nullify	the	agreement	.
Earlier	this	year	,	Dataproducts	had	rejected	a	$	15	*U*	a	share	offer	from	DPC	,	*-1	saying	0	it	was	n't	adequately	financed	*-2	.
DPC	last	week	launched	a	new	,	$	10-a-share	*U*	offer	for	the	Woodland	Hills	,	Calif.-based	computer	printer	maker	.
DPC	said	0	it	could	n't	comment	on	the	suit	.
Boeing	Co.	's	third-quarter	profit	leaped	68	%	,	but	Wall	Street	's	attention	was	focused	*-1	on	the	picket	line	,	not	the	bottom	line	.
In	fact	,	the	earnings	report	unfolded	as	representatives	of	the	world	's	No.	1	jet	maker	and	the	striking	Machinists	union	came	back	to	the	negotiating	table	for	their	first	meeting	in	two	weeks	.
Doug	Hammond	,	the	federal	mediator	in	Seattle	,	where	Boeing	is	based	*-1	*T*-2	,	said	0	the	parties	will	continue	*-3	to	sit	down	daily	until	a	new	settlement	proposal	emerges	or	the	talks	break	off	again	.
Despite	the	progress	,	Boeing	indicated	that	the	work	stoppage	,	now	in	its	27th	day	,	will	have	``	a	serious	adverse	impact	''	on	the	current	quarter	.
For	the	third	quarter	,	net	rose	to	$	242	million	*U*	,	or	$	1.05	*U*	a	share	,	from	$	144	million	*U*	,	or	63	cents	a	share	.
Sales	climbed	71	%	to	$	6.36	billion	*U*	from	$	3.72	billion	*U*	as	the	company	capitalized	on	the	ravenous	global	demand	for	commercial	airliners	.
Because	it	*EXP*-3	's	impossible	*	to	gauge	how	long	the	walkout	by	55,000	Machinists	rank	and	file	will	last	*T*-2	,	the	precise	impact	on	Boeing	's	sales	,	earnings	,	cash	flow	and	short-term	investment	position	could	n't	be	determined	*-1	.
The	investment	community	,	however	,	strongly	believes	that	the	strike	will	be	settled	*-1	before	there	is	any	lasting	effect	on	either	Boeing	or	its	work	force	.
The	company	's	total	firm	backlog	of	unfilled	orders	at	Sept.	30	stood	at	a	mighty	$	69.1	billion	*U*	,	compared	with	$	53.6	billion	*U*	at	the	end	of
Although	the	company	could	see	fourth-quarter	revenue	shrink	by	nearly	$	5	billion	*U*	if	it	is	n't	able	*-2	to	deliver	any	more	planes	this	year	,	those	dollars	actually	would	just	be	deferred	*-1	until	1990	.
And	the	company	is	certain	*-1	to	get	out	some	aircraft	with	just	supervisors	and	other	non-striking	employees	on	hand	.
Before	the	union	rejected	the	company	's	offer	and	the	strike	was	launched	*-1	with	the	graveyard	shift	of	Oct.	4	,	Boeing	had	been	counting	on	*	turning	96	aircraft	out	the	door	in	the	present	period	.
That	included	21	of	the	company	's	747-400	jumbo	jets	,	its	most	successful	product	.
``	It	's	not	a	pretty	picture	,	''	said	*T*-1	David	Smith	,	an	analyst	with	Raymond	James	&	Associates	.
``	But	it	would	just	mean	a	great	first	and	second	quarter	next	year	.	''
Phillip	Brannon	of	Merrill	Lynch	Capital	Markets	added	:	``	You	do	n't	want	*-1	to	minimize	this	and	say	0	nobody	is	looking	at	it	.
But	the	strike	has	n't	gone	on	long	enough	for	Boeing	to	lose	business	in	any	real	sense	.	''
That	's	the	primary	reason	0	the	company	's	share	price	has	held	up	so	well	when	,	in	Mr.	Smith	's	words	,	``	most	companies	would	have	unraveled	''	by	now	*T*-1	*T*-2	.
In	New	York	Stock	Exchange	composite	trading	,	Boeing	closed	yesterday	at	$	54.50	*U*	a	share	,	off	a	scant	12.5	cents	.
Still	,	Boeing	went	through	its	normal	verbal	gymnastics	and	played	up	the	downside	.
In	a	statement	,	Chairman	Frank	Shrontz	asserted	that	the	company	``	faces	significant	challenges	and	risks	,	''	on	both	its	commercial	and	government	contracts	.
For	instance	,	he	noted	that	spending	on	Pentagon	programs	is	shrinking	,	and	Boeing	is	either	the	prime	contractor	or	a	major	supplier	on	many	important	military	projects	,	including	the	B-2	Stealth	bomber	,	the	V-22	Osprey	tilt-rotor	aircraft	and	the	Air	Force	's	next-generation	tactical	fighter	.
Because	of	cost	overruns	on	fixed-price	military	work	,	Mr.	Shrontz	said	0	*T*-1	,	the	company	's	defense	business	will	record	``	a	significant	loss	''	in	1989	.
Moreover	,	Mr.	Shrontz	added	*T*-2	,	production-rate	increases	that	*T*-1	have	been	implemented	*-3	on	the	737	,	747	,	757	and	767	programs	have	resulted	in	``	serious	work	force	skill-dilution	problems	.	''
Suppliers	and	subcontractors	are	experiencing	heightened	pressure	*	to	support	delivery	schedules	.
And	,	of	course	,	there	's	the	unsteady	labor	situation	.
Besides	the	Machinists	pact	,	accords	representing	30,000	of	the	company	's	engineering	and	technical	employees	in	the	Puget	Sound	and	Wichita	,	Kan.	,	areas	expire	in	early	December	.
Also	,	a	contract	with	the	United	Auto	Workers	at	the	company	's	helicopter	plant	in	Philadelphia	expired	Oct.	15	.
This	contract	,	covering	about	3,000	hourly	production	and	maintenance	workers	,	is	being	extended	*-1	on	a	day-to-day	basis	.
The	Machinists	rejected	a	proposal	featuring	a	10	%	base	wage	increase	over	the	life	of	the	three-year	contract	,	plus	bonuses	of	8	%	the	first	year	and	3	%	the	second	.
On	top	of	that	,	Boeing	would	make	cost-of-living	adjustments	projected	*	to	be	5	%	for	each	year	of	the	contract	.
The	union	,	though	,	has	called	the	offer	``	insulting	.	''
The	company	reiterated	yesterday	that	it	's	willing	*-1	to	reconfigure	the	package	,	but	not	add	to	the	substance	of	it	.
For	the	nine	months	,	Boeing	's	net	increased	36	%	to	$	598	million	*U*	,	or	$	2.60	*U*	a	share	,	from	$	440	million	*U*	,	or	$	1.92	*U*	a	share	.
Sales	soared	28	%	to	$	15.43	billion	*U*	from	$	12.09	billion	*U*	.
In	a	separate	matter	,	the	Justice	Department	yesterday	said	0	Boeing	agreed	*-1	to	pay	the	government	$	11	million	*U*	*-2	to	settle	claims	that	the	company	provided	inaccurate	cost	information	to	the	Air	Force	while	*-3	negotiating	contracts	*	to	replace	the	aluminum	skins	on	the	KC-135	tanker	aircraft	.
The	settlement	relates	to	four	contracts	negotiated	*	from	1982	to	1985	,	prosecutors	said	0	*T*-1	.
They	added	that	the	settlement	is	the	culmination	of	a	2	1\/2-year	investigation	into	the	company	's	aluminum	pricing	practices	in	connection	with	KC-135s	.
A	Boeing	spokesman	responded	:	``	All	along	the	company	has	said	0	there	was	no	grounds	for	criminal	prosecution	.
That	was	borne	*-1	out	by	the	Justice	Department	's	decision	''	*	to	settle	the	case	.
Foothills	Pipe	Lines	Ltd.	filed	an	application	*ICH*-1	with	Canadian	regulators	*	to	build	a	4.4	billion	Canadian	dollar	-LRB-	US$	3.74	billion	*U*	-RRB-	pipeline	*	to	transport	natural	gas	from	Canada	's	Arctic	to	U.S.	markets	*	beginning	in
The	application	by	Foothills	,	owned	*	by	Calgary-based	Nova	Corp.	of	Alberta	and	Westcoast	Energy	Inc.	of	Vancouver	,	Canada	,	is	expected	*-2	to	kick	off	what	*T*-1	could	be	a	contentious	battle	for	the	right	*	to	transport	vast	quantities	of	gas	to	southern	markets	from	still-undeveloped	fields	in	Canada	's	Mackenzie	River	delta	.
``	This	is	a	pre-emptive	strike	by	Foothills	,	''	said	*T*-1	Rick	Hillary	,	natural	gas	manager	of	the	Calgary-based	Independent	Petroleum	Association	of	Canada	,	an	industry	group	.
``	Foothills	wants	*-1	to	make	it	*EXP*-3	clear	to	other	pipeline	companies	that	it	's	on	first	insofar	as	*	transporting	gas	from	the	Arctic	to	southern	markets	,	''	Mr.	Hillary	said	*T*-2	.
At	least	two	rival	applications	are	expected	*-2	to	emerge	in	coming	months	,	including	one	from	TransCanada	PipeLines	Ltd.	,	Canada	's	largest	natural	gas	pipeline	operator	.
Another	is	expected	*-3	from	a	consortium	of	oil	and	gas	producers	who	*T*-4	won	conditional	approval	*ICH*-2	this	month	from	Canada	's	National	Energy	Board	*	to	export	about	9.2	trillion	cubic	feet	of	Mackenzie	delta	gas	to	the	U.S.	*	starting	in	1996	.
The	producers	include	Shell	Canada	Ltd.	,	a	unit	of	Royal	Dutch\/Shell	Group	;	Esso	Resources	Canada	Ltd.	,	a	unit	of	Imperial	Oil	Ltd.	,	which	*T*-1	is	71%-owned	by	Exxon	Corp.	;	and	Gulf	Canada	Resources	Ltd.	,	a	unit	of	Olympia	&	York	Developments	Ltd	.
``	The	-LCB-	National	Energy	Board	-RCB-	approval	of	the	exports	just	waved	the	starting	flag	for	the	next	stage	,	the	rush	*	to	build	facilities	0	*T*-1	to	transport	the	gas	,	''	said	*T*-2	Bill	Koerner	,	an	analyst	with	Brady	&	Berliner	,	a	Washington	,	D.C.	,	law	firm	.
Foothills	'	main	rival	0	*T*-2	to	build	a	Mackenzie	Delta	pipeline	is	likely	*-1	to	be	TransCanada	PipeLines	.
The	Toronto-based	company	,	together	with	Tenneco	Inc.	of	Houston	,	has	had	an	incomplete	proposal	filed	*	with	Canadian	regulators	*ICH*-2	since	1984	that	it	is	now	updating	*T*-1	.
Like	Foothills	,	TransCanada	's	Polar	Gas	consortium	plans	*-1	to	build	a	pipeline	*ICH*-3	directly	south	from	the	Mackenzie	River	delta	in	Canada	's	western	Arctic	with	an	initial	capacity	*	to	transport	1.2	billion	cubic	feet	of	gas	daily	.
Industry	sources	said	0	they	expect	a	fierce	battle	*ICH*-4	to	emerge	between	TransCanada	,	which	*T*-1	has	a	monopoly	on	Canadian	gas	transportation	east	of	Alberta	,	and	Nova	and	Westcoast	,	which	*T*-2	control	the	pipelines	within	*RNR*-3	and	running	west	of	*RNR*-3	Alberta	,	respectively	.
``	This	is	virgin	territory	,	unclaimed	,	and	it	's	going	*-3	to	be	nasty	,	''	said	*T*-4	one	observer	,	who	*T*-2	asked	*-5	not	to	be	named	*-1	.
``	Neither	is	going	*-1	to	back	down	easily	.	''
TransCanada	declined	*-1	to	comment	on	the	Foothills	application	.
But	last	week	Gerald	Maier	,	president	and	chief	executive	officer	of	TransCanada	,	said	0	the	company	``	intends	*-2	to	be	a	party	to	any	transportation	system	that	*T*-1	goes	up	there	''	and	that	it	would	consider	joint	ventures	with	other	players	*-3	to	ensure	0	it	has	a	role	.
A	number	of	issues	still	need	*-2	to	be	resolved	*-1	before	Canadian	regulators	give	any	project	the	final	go-ahead	.
First	,	the	price	of	natural	gas	will	have	*-1	to	almost	double	.
Kent	Jesperson	,	president	of	Foothills	,	said	0	the	company	believes	0	the	project	would	be	viable	if	gas	prices	reach	US$	3.25	*U*	a	thousand	cubic	feet	by	1995	,	in	current	dollars	,	up	from	a	current	spot	price	of	about	US$	1.50	*U*	.
Mr.	Jesperson	's	US$	3.25	*U*	estimate	is	somewhat	below	the	$	3.39	*U*	floor	price	that	Calgary-based	consulting	firm	Paul	Ziff	&	Co.	recently	said	0	*T*-2	would	be	needed	*-1	for	Mackenzie	delta	gas	producers	to	see	a	return	on	their	investment	.
U.S.	gas	buyers	must	also	decide	whether	they	want	*-2	to	enter	firm	contracts	for	Mackenzie	delta	gas	or	develop	Alaskan	reserves	in	the	Prudhoe	Bay	area	first	,	a	project	that	*T*-1	has	been	on	hold	for	more	than	a	decade	.
Robert	Pierce	,	chairman	and	chief	executive	of	Foothills	,	said	0	it	's	too	early	*	to	say	whether	Alaskan	or	Mackenzie	delta	gas	would	flow	to	market	first	.
But	Foothills	said	0	it	plans	*-1	to	seek	regulatory	approval	*	to	build	an	alternative	line	,	the	Alaska	Natural	Gas	Transportation	System	further	north	toward	Alaska	.
If	that	option	is	favored	*-1	by	gas	buyers	and	regulators	,	Foothills	said	0	it	would	build	another	smaller	pipeline	connecting	Mackenzie	Delta	reserves	to	the	Alaska	mainline	.
It	's	also	likely	that	regulators	will	try	*-1	to	forge	some	kind	of	consensus	between	the	would-be	pipeline	builders	before	*-1	undertaking	any	hearings	into	rival	projects	.
Douglas	Stoneman	,	vice	president	of	Shell	Canada	,	noted	that	producers	would	prefer	*-2	to	avoid	hearings	into	competing	proposals	that	*T*-1	would	lengthen	the	regulatory	review	process	and	bog	down	development	.
Interprovincial	Pipe	Line	Co.	,	an	oil	pipeline	operator	rumored	*	to	be	mulling	a	gas	pipeline	proposal	of	its	own	,	said	0	that	is	n't	in	the	cards	.
Instead	,	Richard	Haskayne	,	president	and	chief	executive	of	Interprovincial	's	Calgary-based	parent	,	Interhome	Energy	Inc.	,	said	0	the	company	would	prefer	*-1	to	work	with	other	``	interested	parties	''	on	a	joint	proposal	.
As	for	Foothills	'	pre-emptive	bid	,	Mr.	Haskayne	said	,	``	If	they	think	0	it	gives	them	some	kind	of	priority	position	,	well	,	that	's	their	strategy	.
The	Federal	Reserve	Board	said	0	it	is	delaying	approval	of	First	Union	Corp.	's	proposed	$	849	million	*U*	acquisition	of	Florida	National	Banks	of	Florida	Inc.	,	pending	the	outcome	of	an	examination	into	First	Union	's	lending	practices	in	low-income	neighborhoods	.
The	decision	reflects	the	Fed	's	tougher	stance	on	*	enforcing	the	Community	Reinvestment	Act	,	a	federal	law	passed	*	in	1977	*	to	help	low-income	residents	obtain	loans	.
In	recent	years	,	unions	and	community	groups	have	won	big	commitments	*ICH*-1	from	banks	*	to	make	low-interest	loans	in	certain	neighborhoods	by	*-2	threatening	*-3	to	hold	up	proposed	acquisitions	with	protests	to	the	Fed	about	reinvestment	act	compliance	.
Few	petitions	,	however	,	have	actually	delayed	or	scuttled	mergers	.
The	current	dispute	involves	allegations	that	Charlotte	,	N.C.-based	First	Union	has	n't	lived	up	to	its	responsibilities	under	the	reinvestment	act	.
During	the	summer	,	Legal	Services	Corp.	,	a	Florida	legal	aid	group	,	filed	a	petition	with	the	Fed	on	behalf	of	residents	in	four	Florida	counties	.
The	petition	challenged	First	Union	's	lending	record	in	the	state	,	*-2	saying	that	the	bank-holding	company	had	``	shut	itself	off	from	contact	with	the	low-income	community	and	is	redlining	almost	every	black	neighborhood	that	it	serves	*T*-1	in	the	state	.	''
In	*-3	deferring	action	on	the	merger	,	the	Fed	said	0	*T*-1	,	``	The	Board	does	not	believe	that	there	is	sufficient	information	in	the	record	at	this	time	*	to	allow	-LCB-	it	-RCB-	to	reach	a	final	conclusion	on	First	Union	's	record	of	*	helping	*-4	to	meet	the	credit	needs	of	the	communities	0	it	serves	*T*-2	in	Florida	and	North	Carolina	,	including	low	to	moderate-income	neighborhoods	in	those	communities	.	''
The	Fed	said	0	the	Comptroller	of	the	Currency	is	expected	*-1	to	begin	a	Community	Reinvestment	Act	examination	of	First	Union	's	Florida	and	North	Carolina	banking	units	in	the	next	two	weeks	.
First	Union	,	with	assets	of	about	$	32	billion	*U*	,	said	0	it	was	disappointed	*-1	by	the	delay	but	said	0	it	would	cooperate	with	regulatory	authorities	.
The	bank	added	that	it	believes	0	the	review	will	``	demonstrate	that	First	Union	is	in	compliance	with	the	requirements	of	the	Community	Reinvestment	Act	.	''
The	company	has	already	missed	its	initial	Oct.	1	target	date	for	*	completing	the	merger	.
It	said	yesterday	0	it	still	expects	*-1	to	close	the	acquisition	later	this	year	or	early	in	1990	.
Florida	National	,	if	*-1	acquired	*-2	,	would	almost	double	First	Union	's	banking	franchise	in	Florida	to	$	17	billion	*U*	in	assets	.
That	would	make	it	the	second-largest	bank	,	after	Barnett	Banks	Inc.	,	in	a	state	widely	considered	*	to	be	the	most	lucrative	banking	market	in	the	country	.
In	New	York	Stock	Exchange	composite	trading	yesterday	,	First	Union	shares	rose	25	cents	to	$	23	*U*	.
Florida	National	stock	closed	unchanged	at	$	25.875	*U*	in	national	over-the-counter	trading	.
Earlier	this	year	,	the	Fed	denied	an	application	*ICH*-1	by	Continental	Bank	Corp.	*	to	purchase	Grand	Canyon	State	Bank	in	Scottsdale	,	Ariz.	,	on	grounds	that	Continental	had	n't	fully	complied	with	the	Community	Reinvestment	Act	.
At	the	time	,	the	Fed	said	0	the	denial	,	the	first	ever	on	such	grounds	,	signaled	the	agency	's	new	emphasis	on	the	Community	Reinvestment	Act	.
Eastern	Airlines	'	creditors	committee	backed	off	a	move	0	*T*-1	to	come	up	with	its	own	alternative	proposals	to	the	carrier	's	bankruptcy	reorganization	plans	,	according	to	sources	familiar	with	the	committee	.
In	a	meeting	in	New	York	yesterday	,	the	committee	put	on	hold	instructions	*ICH*-1	0	it	gave	*T*-2	two	weeks	ago	to	its	experts	*	to	explore	other	options	for	Eastern	's	future	,	the	sources	said	0	*T*-3	.
The	consultants	had	been	working	*-1	to	finish	a	report	this	week	.
That	means	0	Eastern	,	a	unit	of	Texas	Air	Corp.	of	Houston	,	can	go	forward	with	its	pitch	for	creditor	approval	as	early	as	today	,	when	it	is	expected	*-2	to	deliver	a	revised	reorganization	plan	to	the	committee	*T*-1	.
The	committee	intends	*-1	to	meet	next	week	*-2	to	make	a	recommendation	on	the	new	plan	.
In	another	development	yesterday	,	creditors	were	told	*-1	that	$	40	million	*U*	0	they	had	expected	*T*-2	to	become	available	for	*	implementing	a	reorganization	may	not	materialize	,	according	to	one	source	.
Texas	Air	has	run	into	difficulty	*	reselling	about	$	20	million	*U*	of	debt	securities	because	of	problems	in	the	junk	bond	market	,	the	person	said	0	*T*-1	.
And	plans	*	to	raise	another	$	20	million	*U*	through	changes	to	an	insurance	policy	have	hit	a	snag	,	the	source	said	0	*T*-1	.
An	Eastern	spokesman	said	``	the	$	40	million	*U*	will	have	no	effect	whatsoever	on	the	asset	structure	of	Eastern	's	plan	.
Forty	million	in	the	total	scheme	of	things	is	not	that	significant	.	''
It	*EXP*-2	is	unclear	what	*T*-1	caused	the	creditors	to	do	an	about-face	on	*	exploring	alternatives	to	Eastern	's	new	reorganization	plan	.
However	,	since	Eastern	first	filed	for	Chapter	11	protection	March	9	,	it	has	consistently	promised	*-1	to	pay	creditors	100	cents	on	the	dollar	.
Because	the	carrier	is	still	pledging	*-1	to	do	that	,	some	committee	members	successfully	argued	that	there	's	little	reason	*ICH*-3	yet	0	*	to	explore	a	different	plan	*T*-2	,	according	to	one	person	familiar	with	the	creditors	'	position	.
Earlier	this	month	the	accounting	firm	of	Ernst	&	Young	and	the	securities	firm	of	Goldman	,	Sachs	&	Co.	,	the	experts	hired	*	by	the	creditors	,	contended	that	Eastern	would	have	difficulty	*-1	meeting	earnings	targets	0	the	airline	was	projecting	*T*-2	.
Ernst	&	Young	said	0	Eastern	's	plan	would	miss	projections	by	$	100	million	*U*	.
Goldman	said	0	Eastern	would	miss	the	same	mark	by	at	least	$	120	million	*U*	.
The	consultants	maintained	0	Eastern	would	n't	generate	the	cash	0	it	needs	*T*-1	and	would	have	*-2	to	issue	new	debt	*-3	to	meet	its	targets	under	the	plan	.
Eastern	at	the	time	disputed	those	assessments	and	called	the	experts	'	report	``	completely	off	base	.	''
Yesterday	,	Joel	Zweibel	,	an	attorney	for	Eastern	's	creditors	committee	,	declined	*-2	to	comment	on	whether	the	experts	had	ever	been	instructed	*-1	*-3	to	look	at	other	choices	and	whether	they	now	were	asked	*-4	*-5	not	to	*?*	.
He	said	only	that	the	committee	has	not	yet	taken	any	position	on	Eastern	's	reorganization	plan	and	that	the	two	sides	were	still	negotiating	.
``	In	every	case	,	people	would	like	*-1	to	see	a	consentual	plan	,	''	he	said	*T*-2	.
Eastern	and	its	creditors	agreed	in	July	on	a	reorganization	plan	that	*T*-1	called	for	the	carrier	to	sell	off	$	1.8	billion	*U*	in	assets	and	to	emerge	from	Chapter	11	status	in	late	1989	at	two-thirds	its	former	size	.
Eastern	eventually	decided	*-3	not	to	sell	off	a	major	chunk	,	its	South	American	routes	,	which	*T*-2	were	valued	*-1	at	$	400	million	*U*	.
Such	a	change	meant	0	the	reorganization	plan	0	the	creditors	had	agreed	on	*T*-1	was	no	longer	valid	,	and	the	two	sides	had	*-2	to	begin	*-3	negotiating	again	.
Eastern	has	publicly	stated	0	it	is	exceeding	its	goals	for	*	getting	back	into	operation	and	has	predicted	0	it	would	emerge	from	Chapter	11	proceedings	early	next	year	,	*-1	operating	more	flights	than	it	originally	had	scheduled	*?*	.

West	German	insurance	giant	Allianz	AG	entered	the	takeover	battle	between	France	's	Cie	.	Financiere	de	Paribas	and	Cie.	de	Navigation	Mixte	.
Allianz	said	0	it	won	French	government	approval	*	to	buy	as	much	as	one-third	of	Navigation	Mixte	,	a	diversified	financial	,	transport	and	food	holding	company	.
The	move	comes	a	week	after	Paribas	announced	that	it	was	preparing	*-1	to	bid	for	66.7	%	control	of	Navigation	Mixte	.
Munich-based	Allianz	's	brief	explanatory	statement	said	0	it	is	acting	*-1	to	protect	its	own	interests	as	a	shareholder	of	Navigation	Mixte	.
That	would	be	a	blow	to	both	Paribas	and	Navigation	Mixte	.
Each	had	claimed	Allianz	,	Europe	's	largest	insurance	company	,	as	a	tacit	ally	.
The	Allianz	statement	also	reinforced	the	belief	that	the	takeover	battle	could	be	a	long	one	.
It	led	to	broad	market	speculation	that	Paribas	now	will	sweeten	its	bid	,	which	*T*-1	is	expected	*-2	to	be	formally	launched	later	this	week	,	after	approval	from	French	government	regulators	.
Allianz	's	entry	reflects	the	increasing	eagerness	*ICH*-3	of	West	German	companies	,	looking	ahead	to	the	reduction	in	European	Community	internal	barriers	in	1992	,	*	to	get	involved	in	what	*T*-2	until	now	were	considered	*-1	internal	French	affairs	.
Deutsche	Bank	,	Dresdner	Bank	and	Commerzbank	all	also	have	expressed	eagerness	*-1	to	expand	in	France	before	1992	.
Dresdner	Bank	this	month	moved	*-1	to	acquire	Banque	Internationale	des	Placements	,	a	small	French	merchant	bank	that	Deutsche	Bank	had	looked	at	*T*-2	and	passed	*T*-2	over	.
Commerzbank	had	hoped	*-1	to	buy	a	stake	in	Credit	Lyonnais	,	until	the	Socialists	returned	to	government	last	year	and	canceled	plans	*	to	privatize	the	large	French	bank	.
Deutsche	Bank	has	actively	sought	a	French	acquisition	for	at	least	two	years	.
Lately	,	analysts	say	0	*T*-1	,	Deutsche	Bank	has	shocked	some	in	the	French	financial	community	by	*-2	indicating	0	it	wants	a	strong	bank	with	a	large	number	of	branches	.
``	We	are	still	looking	,	''	said	*T*-1	a	Deutsche	Bank	spokesman	.
``	The	banks	0	we	think	0	*T*-1	would	fit	into	our	concept	are	either	government-owned	or	not	for	sale	,	though	Deutsche	Bank	would	be	able	*-2	to	pay	a	good	price	.	''
While	Allianz	officials	were	n't	willing	*-2	to	comment	in	any	detail	on	their	plans	,	they	said	0	Allianz	currently	holds	between	5	%	and	10	%	*U*	of	Navigation	Mixte	,	an	apparent	increase	from	the	5	%	stake	that	Navigation	Mixte	officials	had	earlier	announced	*T*-1	.
Paris	market	sources	said	0	they	believed	0	Allianz	was	buying	yesterday	morning	,	and	Navigation	Mixte	moved	up	108	francs	-LRB-	$	17.19	*U*	-RRB-	*-1	to	close	at	1,908	francs	in	heavy	trading	.
It	was	the	first	day	of	trading	following	the	suspension	of	Navigation	Mixte	shares	last	Monday	,	when	Paribas	announced	its	plan	*	to	pay	1,850	francs	for	each	Navigation	Mixte	share	*T*-1	.
Allianz	also	holds	a	50	%	stake	in	Navigation	Mixte	's	insurance	subsidiary	,	one	of	France	's	largest	insurance	groups	,	which	it	bought	*T*-1	for	about	6.5	billion	francs	just	before	Paribas	launched	its	bid	.
Navigation	Mixte	holds	the	remaining	50	%	.
Allianz	said	in	its	statement	that	it	was	acting	*-2	to	protect	that	interest	,	which	*T*-1	ties	it	to	Navigation	Mixte	as	a	partner	.
Allianz	's	statement	stressed	the	company	's	previously	announced	position	that	Paribas	's	offer	price	is	too	low	.
Allianz	also	suggested	,	without	*-1	saying	so	directly	,	that	it	regrets	that	Paribas	is	n't	bidding	for	all	of	Navigation	Mixte	's	shares	.
The	problem	here	,	analysts	say	0	*T*-1	,	is	that	if	Paribas	wins	its	66.7	%	,	remaining	Navigation	Mixte	shares	will	fall	in	value	.
That	displeases	many	current	holders	,	such	as	Allianz	,	which	*T*-1	could	n't	be	sure	of	*-2	selling	all	their	shares	if	they	tendered	to	Paribas	.
The	Allianz	statement	led	to	speculation	that	Allianz	eventually	could	sell	to	Paribas	.
That	would	be	bad	news	for	Navigation	Mixte	's	current	management	,	which	*T*-1	was	counting	on	Allianz	*-2	to	help	*-3	fend	off	Paribas	.
Allianz	did	n't	say	whom	,	if	anyone	,	it	will	support	*T*-1	.
It	said	simply	that	it	will	boost	its	Navigation	Mixte	stake	as	it	sees	fit	over	the	coming	days	*-1	to	protect	itself	,	as	long	as	it	has	French	regulatory	officials	'	approval	.
Paribas	currently	intends	*-2	to	offer	1,850	francs	a	share	for	Navigation	Mixte	shares	that	*T*-1	receive	full	dividends	this	year	.
It	is	*-2	to	offer	1,800	francs	for	shares	created	*	on	July	1	,	which	*T*-1	receive	partial	dividends	.
Alternatively	,	it	would	offer	*-1	to	swap	three	Paribas	shares	for	one	Navigation	Mixte	share	.
Paribas	already	holds	about	18.7	%	of	Navigation	Mixte	,	and	the	acquisition	of	the	additional	48	%	would	cost	it	about	11	billion	francs	under	its	current	bid	.
The	bid	values	Navigation	Mixte	at	around	23	billion	francs	,	depending	on	how	many	holders	of	Navigation	Mixte	warrants	*T*-1	exchange	them	for	shares	before	the	bid	expires	.
Penn	Central	Corp.	,	Cincinnati	,	said	0	it	agreed	in	principle	*-1	to	acquire	Noranda	Inc.	's	Carol	Cable	Co.	unit	for	$	177	million	*U*	.
The	company	said	0	Carol	Cable	,	based	*	in	Pawtucket	,	R.I.	,	is	a	leading	supplier	of	electrical	and	electronic	wire	and	cable	for	the	distributor	,	retail	and	original	equipment	manufacturer	markets	.
Carol	Cable	,	which	*T*-1	operates	12	manufacturing	plants	,	had	operating	profit	of	$	11.7	million	*U*	on	sales	of	$	153.3	million	*U*	for	the	first	six	months	of	this	year	and	operating	profit	of	$	25.6	million	*U*	on	sales	of	$	294.6	million	*U*	for	all	of	1988	.
The	maker	of	telecommunications	and	defense	equipment	said	0	Carol	Cable	's	portfolio	and	market	focus	would	complement	the	company	's	current	wire	and	cable	businesses	.
The	plan	is	subject	to	a	satisfactory	due	diligence	investigation	of	Carol	Cable	by	Penn	Central	,	a	definitive	agreement	and	regulatory	approvals	.
Fletcher	Challenge	Ltd.	said	0	its	Petrocorp	unit	agreed	*-1	to	acquire	certain	Alberta	oil	and	gas	interests	from	Amoco	Corp.	's	Canadian	unit	,	for	about	130	million	Canadian	dollars	-LRB-	US$	110.6	million	*U*	-RRB-	.
Fletcher	Challenge	,	a	big	New	Zealand-based	forest	products	concern	with	forestry	operations	in	Canada	,	said	0	the	assets	include	stakes	in	four	natural	gas	fields	and	one	oil	field	near	Provost	,	Alberta	,	plus	gas	processing	facilities	and	about	247,000	acres	of	undeveloped	land	.
The	proposed	purchase	requires	approval	from	Investment	Canada	,	which	*T*-1	monitors	large	foreign	investments	in	Canada	.
Amoco	Canada	Petroleum	Co.	,	which	*T*-1	operates	the	major	properties	included	*	in	the	asset	package	,	said	0	the	sale	is	part	of	a	plan	*	to	streamline	its	assets	.
Petrocorp	,	a	New	Zealand-based	oil	and	gas	producer	,	said	0	the	planned	purchase	would	be	its	first	oil	and	gas	acquisition	outside	its	home	country	,	and	would	form	the	basis	for	a	new	stand-alone	exploration	and	production	unit	in	Canada	.
MiniScribe	Corp.	,	Longmont	,	Colo.	,	said	0	it	introduced	a	one-inch	high	,	80-megabyte	hard	disk	drive	that	it	hopes	0	*T*-1	will	prove	popular	with	makers	of	high-performance	laptop	and	portable	computers	.
The	troubled	disk	drive	maker	aims	with	the	new	3	1\/2-inch	disks	*-1	to	revive	its	reputation	and	sales	growth	.
MiniScribe	said	0	the	disk	drives	have	more	memory	capacity	than	other	disks	that	size	.
MiniScribe	said	0	it	expects	*-1	to	begin	full	volume	production	of	the	drives	in	the	U.S.	and	Singapore	in	the	first	quarter	next	year	.
A	drive	with	120	megabytes	of	capacity	is	scheduled	*-1	for	release	during	the	third	quarter	of	1990	.
MiniScribe	has	been	on	the	rocks	since	it	disclosed	early	this	year	that	its	earnings	reports	for	1988	were	n't	accurate	.
After	an	internal	investigation	,	the	company	found	that	senior	officials	used	a	variety	of	schemes	*ICH*-2	*-1	to	fabricate	sales	gains	,	including	*	counting	shipments	of	bricks	and	defective	drives	as	sales	.
The	New	York	Times	Co.	said	0	it	reached	a	settlement	with	independent	home	delivery	dealers	in	the	metropolitan	New	York	area	that	*T*-1	will	free	the	newspaper	to	expand	home	delivery	circulation	.
The	settlement	stemmed	from	a	lawsuit	0	the	dealers	filed	*T*-1	in	1982	when	the	Times	began	its	own	competing	direct	delivery	service	*T*-2	.
The	pact	calls	for	the	Times	to	pay	dealers	$	3.6	million	*U*	over	six	years	,	as	well	as	other	payments	in	the	form	of	subsidies	over	three	years	,	based	*	on	the	number	of	``	new	customers	started	*	by	the	dealers	and	on	pricing	structures	,	''	the	Times	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	amount	of	the	settlement	will	be	taken	*-1	as	a	charge	against	earnings	in	the	fourth	quarter	.
The	settlement	,	which	*T*-1	involves	most	of	the	300	independent	newspaper	dealers	in	the	New	York	area	,	will	allow	the	Times	to	freely	operate	its	own	direct	home	delivery	system	.
Home	delivery	is	the	fastest	growing	segment	of	the	Times	's	1.1	million	daily	circulation	.
Currently	,	about	60	%	of	home	delivery	subscribers	in	the	New	York	area	receive	the	paper	directly	from	the	Times	.
Mercury	Savings	&	Loan	Association	,	Huntington	Beach	,	Calif.	,	reported	a	third-quarter	loss	of	$	3.9	million	*U*	,	or	61	cents	a	share	,	compared	with	net	income	of	$	1.4	million	*U*	,	or	22	cents	a	share	,	in	the	year-earlier	quarter	.
Mercury	attributed	the	loss	to	rapid	prepayments	of	loans	and	costs	incurred	*	in	*	refinancing	many	house	loans	this	past	spring	and	summer	,	when	interest	rates	dipped	*T*-1	.
The	thrift	hired	an	investment	banker	earlier	this	month	*-1	to	advise	it	regarding	a	possible	sale	or	merger	.
Mercury	also	is	shrinking	itself	,	part	of	its	plan	*	to	change	its	emphasis	from	*	buying	mortgage	loans	from	mortgage	brokers	to	*	making	loans	directly	.
Such	a	focus	is	``	more	profitable	,	more	efficient	and	gives	us	a	greater	sense	of	control	,	''	said	0	*T*-1	William	A.	Shane	,	Mercury	's	senior	executive	vice	president	.
As	of	Sept.	30	,	Mercury	's	assets	were	$	2.25	billion	*U*	,	down	from	$	2.62	billion	*U*	a	year	ago	.
For	the	nine	months	,	Mercury	posted	a	loss	of	$	5.4	million	*U*	,	or	86	cents	share	,	against	net	income	of	$	4	million	*U*	,	or	63	cents	share	,	a	year	earlier	.
Mercury	shares	closed	yesterday	at	$	4.625	*U*	,	up	50	cents	,	in	New	York	Stock	Exchange	composite	trading	.
Bancroft	Convertible	Fund	Inc.	,	New	York	,	likely	will	reject	a	renewed	offer	*ICH*-1	from	Florida	investor	Robert	I.	Green	*	to	buy	Bancroft	for	$	18.95	*U*	a	share	.
Sigmund	Levine	,	Bancroft	secretary	and	treasurer	,	said	0	the	closed-end	fund	's	directors	will	consider	Mr.	Green	's	offer	in	a	couple	of	weeks	at	a	regular	meeting	.
``	He	has	n't	added	anything	,	''	Mr.	Levine	said	*T*-1	,	*-2	predicting	0	the	board	will	again	reject	Mr.	Green	's	proposal	.
In	a	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	filing	,	Mr.	Green	said	0	he	had	boosted	his	holdings	in	Bancroft	common	to	10.4	%	from	8.5	%	,	and	renewed	an	offer	*ICH*-2	0	he	made	*T*-1	in	March	*	to	acquire	the	fund	.
Mr.	Levine	noted	that	Bancroft	's	shares	have	been	trading	at	or	above	Mr.	Green	's	offering	price	for	the	last	several	months	.
He	said	0	Bancroft	attorneys	are	scheduled	*-1	to	meet	with	Mr.	Green	's	attorneys	in	Delaware	Chancery	Court	at	the	end	of	this	week	*-2	to	respond	to	the	investor	's	request	for	company	records	for	the	past	five	years	.
Mr.	Green	could	n't	be	reached	*-1	.
Giant	Group	said	0	a	federal	court	in	Delaware	has	denied	a	motion	by	Rally	's	Inc.	seeking	*	to	block	a	group	led	*	by	Giant	Chairman	Burt	Sugarman	from	*-1	acquiring	more	of	the	company	's	shares	.
Rally	's	,	a	fast-food	chain	based	*	in	Louisville	,	Ky.	,	is	contending	that	Mr.	Sugarman	and	two	other	company	directors	failed	*-1	to	disclose	to	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	that	they	intended	*-2	to	acquire	a	big	Rally	stake	.
Mr.	Sugarman	has	in	turn	contended	that	the	other	major	shareholder	group	--	whose	interests	*T*-2	are	represented	*-1	by	three	other	directors	connected	*	to	trusts	in	the	name	of	the	children	of	the	company	's	founder	,	James	Patterson	--	has	ties	to	a	competing	fast	food	chain	,	Wendy	's	International	Inc	.
The	company	last	week	assembled	a	three-member	committee	of	directors	aligned	*	with	neither	side	*	to	analyze	the	situation	.
Each	group	controls	more	than	40	%	of	Rally	's	stock	.
The	company	just	went	public	earlier	this	month	.
Rally	's	had	no	comment	,	but	was	expected	*-2	to	make	an	announcement	*ICH*-1	this	morning	about	the	situation	.
Singer	Bette	Midler	won	a	$	400,000	*U*	federal	court	jury	verdict	against	Young	&	Rubicam	in	a	case	that	*T*-1	threatens	a	popular	advertising	industry	practice	of	*	using	``	sound-alike	''	performers	*	to	tout	products	.
The	decision	in	Los	Angeles	federal	court	stems	from	a	1985	Mercury	Sable	TV	ad	that	Young	&	Rubicam	worked	*T*-1	up	for	Ford	Motor	Co	.
The	ad	agency	had	approached	Ms.	Midler	about	appearing	,	but	she	declined	,	*-2	citing	a	longstanding	policy	of	*	refusing	advertising	work	.
The	agency	then	turned	to	a	former	backup	singer	for	Ms.	Midler	who	*T*-1	appeared	in	the	ad	and	crooned	what	*T*-2	was	generally	considered	*-3	a	more	than	credible	imitation	of	Ms.	Midler	's	1973	hit	song	``	Do	You	Wanna	Dance	.	''
The	appeals	court	held	:	``	When	a	distinctive	voice	of	a	professional	singer	is	widely	known	*-3	and	is	deliberately	imitated	in	order	*	to	sell	a	product	*T*-2	,	the	sellers	have	appropriated	what	*T*-1	is	not	theirs	.	''
The	judge	in	the	jury	trial	said	0	there	was	insufficient	evidence	0	*	to	hold	Ford	liable	in	the	case	*T*-1	.
In	a	statement	,	Young	&	Rubicam	called	the	award	``	unfortunate	but	bearable	.	''
Peter	Laird	,	a	Los	Angeles	lawyer	for	Ms.	Midler	,	said	,	``	We	believe	that	the	verdict	reaffirms	her	position	*RNR*-1	and	our	position	*RNR*-1	that	advertisers	and	advertising	agencies	can	not	with	impunity	imitate	the	voices	of	well-known	performers	.
That	is	a	property	right	that	*T*-1	belongs	to	the	performer	.	''
The	award	,	although	*-2	far	less	than	the	$	10	million	*U*	,	including	punitive	damages	,	that	Ms.	Midler	sought	*T*-1	,	is	likely	*-2	to	force	Madison	Avenue	to	further	rethink	how	they	use	famous	songs	in	ads	*T*-3	.
Last	year	's	appeals	court	decision	,	for	instance	,	spawned	several	suits	,	reportedly	including	a	recent	action	by	the	heirs	of	singer	Bobby	Darin	against	McDonald	's	Corp.	over	its	``	Mac	Tonight	''	TV	commercials	,	a	rough	parody	of	Mr.	Darin	's	``	Mack	the	Knife	''	trademark	.
The	appeals-court	decision	last	year	was	particularly	surprising	because	the	same	court	had	dismissed	a	similar	case	*ICH*-1	in	1970	involving	singer	Nancy	Sinatra	and	a	tire	ad	--	also	a	Young	&	Rubicam	product	.
Ms.	Sinatra	sued	over	the	use	of	her	``	These	Boots	are	Made	*-1	for	Walkin	'	''	song	in	the	ad	.
At	that	time	,	the	court	held	that	such	a	claim	would	interfere	with	federal	copyright	law	,	which	*T*-1	has	always	cracked	down	on	the	unauthorized	copying	of	songs	and	musical	compositions	but	never	actual	performances	.
``	One	thing	that	*T*-1	is	a	little	unnerving	is	that	you	had	three	old	men	on	the	court	of	appeals	in	California	coming	up	with	a	statement	that	Nancy	Sinatra	is	not	distinctive	but	that	Bette	Midler	is	*?*	.

The	Dutch	unit	,	known	*	as	Celtona	B.V.	,	is	a	leading	maker	of	consumer	and	away-from-home	tissue	products	for	the	Benelux	region	.
In	addition	,	the	acquisition	includes	production	assets	of	Invercon	Papermils	,	a	maker	of	household	tissue	products	for	the	U.K.	and	Ireland	.
The	combined	operations	had	1988	revenue	of	about	$	100	million	*U*	.

The	company	said	0	it	plans	*-1	to	form	European	ventures	with	Italian	and	Finnish	companies	.
The	Celtona	operations	would	become	part	of	those	ventures	.
Vitro	S.A.	of	Monterrey	,	Mexico	,	said	0	its	THR	Corp.	subsidiary	has	entered	into	definitive	loan	agreements	in	connection	with	Vitro	's	$	21.25-a-share	*U*	tender	offer	for	Anchor	Glass	Container	Corp	.
The	agreements	are	with	Security	Pacific	National	Bank	and	an	affiliate	of	Donaldson	,	Lufkin	&	Jenrette	Securities	Corp	.

Vitro	said	0	the	definitive	agreements	require	that	Anchor	obtain	a	waiver	from	its	bank	lenders	of	existing	covenant	defaults	under	its	bank	facilities	.
Since	Anchor	is	still	seeking	this	waiver	,	Vitro	said	0	the	tender	offer	is	being	extended	*-1	until	5	p.m.	EST	tomorrow	.
The	dollar	finished	mostly	stronger	yesterday	,	*-1	boosted	*-2	by	a	modest	recovery	in	share	prices	.

``	Attention	is	fixed	on	the	stock	market	for	lack	of	anything	else	0	*	to	sink	our	teeth	into	*T*-1	,	''	said	*T*-2	Robert	White	,	a	vice	president	at	First	Interstate	of	California	.
Some	analysts	predict	that	in	the	absence	of	market-moving	news	0	*T*-1	to	push	the	U.S.	unit	sharply	higher	or	lower	,	the	currency	is	likely	*-2	to	drift	below	1.80	marks	this	week	.
But	others	reject	the	view	,	and	forecast	0	the	dollar	will	continue	*-1	to	hold	its	current	tight	trading	pattern	.
They	argue	that	weakness	in	both	the	yen	and	sterling	have	helped	*-1	offset	bearish	U.S.	economic	news	and	have	lent	support	to	the	dollar	.
In	late	New	York	trading	yesterday	,	the	dollar	was	quoted	*-1	at	1.8340	marks	,	up	from	1.8300	marks	late	Friday	,	and	at	141.90	yen	,	up	from	141.65	yen	late	Friday	.

In	Tokyo	Tuesday	,	the	U.S.	currency	opened	for	trading	at	142.32	yen	,	up	from	Monday	's	Tokyo	close	of	142.17	yen	.
Last	week	,	the	surprise	resignation	of	British	Chancellor	of	the	Exchequer	Nigel	Lawson	sent	the	British	pound	into	a	tailspin	.
While	sterling	bounced	back	from	session	lows	in	a	bout	of	short-covering	yesterday	,	foreign	exchange	dealers	said	that	any	hopes	that	the	pound	would	soon	post	significant	gains	have	evaporated	.
Traders	said	that	statements	made	*	over	the	weekend	*	to	quell	concern	about	the	stability	of	Prime	Minister	Margaret	Thatcher	's	government	and	the	future	of	her	economic	program	largely	failed	*-2	to	reassure	investors	and	bolster	the	flagging	British	unit	.
In	her	first	televised	interview	following	Mr.	Lawson	's	resignation	,	Mrs.	Thatcher	reiterated	her	desire	*	to	keep	sterling	strong	and	warned	again	that	full	entry	into	the	European	Monetary	System	's	exchange	rate	mechanism	would	provide	no	easy	solution	to	Britain	's	economic	troubles	.
She	said	that	the	timing	of	the	United	Kingdom	's	entry	would	depend	on	the	speed	with	which	other	members	liberalize	their	economies	*T*-1	.
Mrs.	Thatcher	's	remarks	were	seen	*-1	as	a	rebuff	to	several	leading	members	of	her	own	Conservative	Party	who	*T*-2	have	called	for	a	more	clear-cut	British	commitment	to	the	EMS	.
At	the	same	time	,	a	recent	poll	shows	that	Mrs.	Thatcher	has	hit	the	lowest	popularity	rating	of	any	British	leader	since	polling	began	50	years	ago	.
Comments	by	John	Major	,	who	*T*-1	has	succeeded	Mr.	Lawson	,	also	failed	*-2	to	damp	market	concern	,	despite	his	pledge	*	to	maintain	relatively	high	British	interest	rates	.
According	to	one	London-based	analyst	,	even	higher	interest	rates	wo	n't	help	the	pound	if	Britain	's	government	continues	*-1	to	appear	unstable	.
One	U.S.	trader	,	however	,	dismissed	sterling	doomsayers	while	*-1	acknowledging	0	there	is	little	immediate	upside	potential	for	the	U.K.	unit	.
``	There	is	no	question	that	the	situation	is	bad	,	but	we	may	be	painting	a	gloomier	picture	than	we	should	*?*	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
He	predicts	0	the	pound	will	continue	*-1	to	trade	in	a	very	volatile	fashion	,	with	``	fits	of	*	being	oversold	and	overbought	*-2	''	before	*-1	recovering	its	losses	.
Dealers	also	note	that	the	general	lack	of	enthusiasm	for	the	yen	has	helped	*-1	bolster	the	U.S.	dollar	.
They	observe	that	persistent	Japanese	investor	demand	for	dollars	for	both	portfolio	and	direct	investment	has	kept	a	base	of	support	for	the	dollar	at	around	140	yen	.
The	dollar	began	yesterday	on	a	firm	note	in	Tokyo	,	*	closing	higher	in	late	trade	.
In	Europe	,	the	dollar	closed	slightly	up	in	a	market	dominated	*	by	cross	trades	.

Cray	's	directors	set	Nov.	15	as	the	record	date	for	distribution	of	shares	in	the	new	company	,	0	*T*-2	to	be	called	*-1	Cray	Computer	Corp	.
It	will	trade	over	the	counter	under	the	symbol	CRAY	.
The	plan	calls	for	Cray	Research	holders	to	receive	one	share	in	the	new	company	for	every	two	shares	held	*	.
An	estimated	14.7	million	Cray	Computer	shares	will	be	distributed	*-1	,	Cray	Research	said	0	*T*-2	.
Under	the	accord	,	Cray	Research	will	transfer	to	Mr.	Cray	's	fledgling	operation	$	53.3	million	*U*	of	assets	primarily	related	*	to	the	Cray-3	development	project	0	his	team	is	undertaking	*T*-1	and	will	lend	Cray	Computer	$	98.6	million	*U*	.
Cray	Research	will	retain	a	10	%	interest	in	the	new	company	,	which	*T*-2	will	be	based	*-1	in	Colorado	Springs	,	Colo	.
When	it	announced	the	planned	breakup	in	May	*T*-1	,	Cray	Research	said	0	development	costs	of	several	competing	projects	were	squeezing	its	earnings	growth	.
After	the	split	,	the	two	companies	presumably	will	be	rivals	for	orders	from	government	and	commercial	customers	.
Interface	Systems	Inc.	,	Ann	Arbor	,	Mich.	,	said	0	it	will	report	0	net	income	for	the	fourth	quarter	ended	Sept.	30	fell	to	$	470,000	*U*	,	or	11	cents	a	share	,	from	$	805,000	*U*	,	or	19	cents	a	share	,	a	year	earlier	.
Chairman	Carl	L.	Bixby	said	0	the	decline	occurred	although	revenue	rose	30	%	to	more	than	$	8.3	million	*U*	from	$	6.4	million	*U*	a	year	earlier	.
The	company	,	which	*T*-1	makes	computer	parts	said	0	fiscal	1989	earnings	were	``	down	slightly	''	from	$	3.2	million	*U*	,	or	74	cents	a	share	,	in	fiscal	l988	.
The	company	said	0	fiscal	1989	revenue	increased	about	30	%	to	more	than	$	32	million	*U*	from	$	25.3	million	*U*	.
Mr.	Bixby	said	that	early	signs	point	to	improved	earnings	and	revenue	in	the	first	quarter	of	fiscal	1990	.
``	The	current	backlog	of	orders	is	strong	throughout	the	corporation	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
Priam	Corp.	said	0	it	filed	for	protection	under	Chapter	11	of	the	federal	Bankruptcy	Code	and	announced	a	35	%	reduction	in	its	world-wide	employment	.
The	filing	in	bankruptcy	court	here	follows	a	string	of	quarterly	losses	and	product	glitches	for	the	maker	of	harddisk	drives	for	minicomputers	and	microcomputers	.
Priam	had	a	loss	of	$	25.4	million	*U*	for	the	fiscal	year	ended	July	7	,	compared	with	year-earlier	profit	of	$	543,000	*U*	,	or	two	cents	a	share	.
Revenue	for	the	year	fell	13	%	to	$	122.7	million	*U*	.
The	200-person	staff	cutback	announced	*	yesterday	will	bring	Priam	's	employment	to	about	380	workers	,	less	than	half	of	what	it	was	*T*-1	before	a	similar	,	230-person	reduction	in	August	.
The	company	yesterday	also	said	0	it	was	scrapping	one	of	its	major	new	products	,	a	760-megabyte	drive	,	which	*T*-1	,	while	*-2	technically	proficient	,	did	n't	hold	much	promise	of	*	generating	substantial	orders	because	financing	problems	caused	a	nine-month	delay	in	*	getting	the	product	to	market	.
The	French	Economics	Ministry	approved	a	planned	asset	swap	between	the	defense	and	electronics	group	Thomson-CSF	S.A.	and	the	bank	group	Credit	Lyonnais	.
The	ministry	said	0	the	swap	,	details	of	which	*T*-2	were	disclosed	*-1	last	Thursday	,	will	allow	both	state-controlled	companies	to	reinforce	operations	in	their	main	markets	and	argued	that	the	move	shows	the	dynamism	of	France	's	state-sector	concerns	.
The	approval	also	ends	any	hope	that	Banque	Nationale	de	Paris	,	another	state-sector	bank	,	might	have	had	*T*-1	about	*	taking	Credit	Lyonnais	's	place	in	the	accord	.
It	hinted	over	the	weekend	that	it	would	have	been	interested	in	a	hook-up	with	Thomson-CSF	.
Under	details	of	the	accord	,	Credit	Lyonnais	will	take	slightly	more	than	50	%	of	Thomson-CSF	Finance	in	exchange	for	about	14	%	of	its	own	shares	.
The	move	will	help	the	bank	to	keep	up	with	international	solvency	ratios	being	phased	*	in	by	the	Bank	for	International	Settlements	and	will	also	represent	the	first	time	that	its	voting	shares	have	been	held	*-1	by	a	party	other	than	the	government	*T*-2	.
Bio-Technology	General	Corp.	received	tenders	for	97.9	%	of	its	7.5	%	convertible	senior	subordinated	notes	due	April	15	,	1997	,	and	96	%	of	its	11	%	convertible	senior	subordinated	debentures	due	March	1	,	2006	.
In	exchange	offers	that	*T*-1	expired	Friday	,	holders	of	each	$	1,000	*U*	of	notes	will	receive	$	250	*U*	face	amount	of	Series	A	7.5	%	senior	secured	convertible	notes	due	Jan.	15	,	1995	,	and	200	common	shares	.
For	each	$	1,000	*U*	face	amount	of	debentures	,	holders	received	$	250	*U*	of	Series	B	11	%	senior	secured	convertible	notes	due	Oct.	15	,	1998	,	and	200	common	shares	.
Bio-Technology	,	a	New	York	maker	of	genetically	engineered	products	for	human	and	animal	health	care	,	said	0	it	made	the	exchange	offer	*-1	to	reduce	its	interest	payments	.
Japanese	companies	have	long	been	accused	*-1	of	*	sacrificing	profit	*-2	to	boost	sales	.
But	Fujitsu	Ltd.	has	taken	that	practice	to	a	new	extreme	.
Japan	's	biggest	computer	maker	last	week	undercut	seven	competitors	*-1	to	win	a	contract	*	to	design	a	mapping	system	for	the	city	of	Hiroshima	's	waterworks	.
Its	bid	:	one	yen	,	or	less	than	a	U.S.	penny	.
The	bid	created	such	a	furor	that	Fujitsu	said	0	it	is	now	offering	*-1	to	withdraw	from	the	project	.
``	From	a	common-sense	viewpoint	,	it	was	not	socially	acceptable	,	''	a	Fujitsu	spokeswoman	said	*T*-1	yesterday	.
Hiroshima	city	officials	could	n't	be	reached	*-1	*	to	find	out	whether	they	would	drop	Fujitsu	's	bid	.
Fujitsu	said	0	it	issued	the	low	bid	because	it	wanted	a	foot	in	the	door	of	a	potentially	lucrative	market	.
``	We	desperately	wanted	the	contract	because	we	want	experience	in	the	field	,	''	the	Fujitsu	spokeswoman	said	0	*T*-1	.
``	We	expect	a	big	market	in	the	future	,	so	in	the	long	term	it	will	be	profitable	.
It	's	a	kind	of	an	investment	.	''
Hiroshima	's	waterworks	bureau	said	0	the	municipal	government	had	budgeted	about	11	million	yen	-LRB-	$	77,500	*U*	-RRB-	for	the	project	.
``	I	was	flabbergasted	*-3	,	''	Tatsuhara	Yamane	,	head	of	the	bureau	,	was	quoted	*-1	by	Kyodo	news	service	as	*-4	saying	*T*-2	.
``	I	understand	the	firm	's	enthusiasm	in	*	getting	the	deal	,	but	such	a	large	company	would	have	been	better	off	*-1	showing	a	little	more	discretion	.	''
Indeed	,	Fujitsu	officials	admitted	0	they	may	have	been	a	little	overzealous	.
The	Fujitsu	spokeswoman	said	0	headquarter	officials	did	n't	approve	the	bid	in	advance	and	will	take	measures	so	this	kind	of	thing	does	n't	happen	in	the	future	.
``	It	's	contrary	to	common	sense	,	''	she	added	*T*-1	.
Specifically	,	Fujitsu	won	the	right	*	to	design	the	specifications	for	a	computerized	system	that	*T*-1	will	show	water	lines	throughout	the	city	.
The	system	could	be	used	*-1	in	a	fire	or	earthquake	*-2	to	locate	problems	,	among	other	things	.
A	waterworks	official	said	0	Fujitsu	will	have	*-1	to	design	the	system	so	it	would	be	compatible	with	other	makers	'	equipment	.
But	industry	officials	expressed	concern	that	the	initial	project	might	give	Fujitsu	an	edge	in	*	winning	more	lucrative	contracts	later	.
Fujitsu	said	0	it	hopes	0	the	Hiroshima	contract	will	help	it	secure	pacts	with	other	municipalities	.
Japanese	local	governments	are	expected	*-1	to	invest	heavily	in	computer	systems	over	the	next	few	years	,	and	many	companies	expect	that	field	to	provide	substantial	revenue	.
``	In	the	near	future	,	it	will	be	a	big	market	,	not	just	for	waterworks	,	but	for	all	mapping	systems	,	''	the	Fujitsu	spokeswoman	said	*T*-1	.
``	We	can	expect	a	hundreds-of-billions-of-yen	market	.	''
No	foreign	companies	bid	on	the	Hiroshima	project	,	according	to	the	bureau	.
But	the	Japanese	practice	of	deep	discounting	often	is	cited	*-1	by	Americans	as	a	classic	barrier	to	entry	in	Japan	's	market	.
Earlier	this	year	,	the	U.S.	complained	that	Japan	's	supercomputer	makers	were	effectively	closing	out	foreign	competitors	by	*-1	slashing	prices	as	much	as	90	%	for	universities	.
Fujitsu	was	n't	the	only	company	willing	*	to	sacrifice	profit	on	the	project	.
Three	competitors	bid	between	300,000	yen	and	500,000	yen	,	according	to	the	Hiroshima	government	office	.
Other	bids	ranged	from	about	10	million	yen	to	29	million	yen	.
American	Airlines	will	expand	its	trans-Atlantic	service	30	%	beginning	next	year	with	six	new	daily	flights	between	the	U.S.	and	Europe	,	officials	announced	0	*T*-2	yesterday	.
American	,	a	unit	of	AMR	Corp.	,	is	the	nation	's	largest	airline	.
The	new	nonstop	flights	,	starting	next	May	,	will	include	Chicago-Warsaw	,	Chicago-Helsinki	,	Miami-Madrid	,	Dallas-Barcelona	,	a	second	daily	Chicago-Paris	flight	and	a	second	daily	Chicago-Manchester	flight	,	the	officials	said	0	*T*-2	.
Chicago	has	the	largest	population	of	citizens	of	Polish	heritage	in	any	city	outside	Poland	.
With	the	new	service	,	American	will	fly	161	flights	a	week	to	17	European	cities	.
The	additions	solidify	American	's	position	as	the	third-largest	U.S.	transatlantic	carrier	,	behind	PanAm	Corp.	's	Pan	American	World	Airways	and	Trans	World	Airlines	.
Karstadt	AG	said	0	sales	for	its	domestic	group	rose	4.6	%	in	the	first	nine	months	of	1989	from	a	year	earlier	.
The	West	German	retailing	group	also	said	that	the	results	of	the	first	three	quarters	suggest	0	it	will	meet	its	profit	goal	for	the	year	.
Earnings	at	the	department-store	division	,	which	*T*-1	generates	the	bulk	of	profit	,	should	remain	at	least	stable	,	while	income	at	the	mail-order	and	tourism	units	is	likely	*-3	to	fall	slightly	from	1988	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-2	.
Karstadt	did	n't	give	any	group	sales	or	profit	figures	for	the	first	nine	months	.
Georgia-Pacific	Corp.	offered	*-1	to	acquire	Great	Northern	Nekoosa	Corp.	for	$	58	*U*	a	share	,	or	about	$	3.18	billion	*U*	.
The	offer	capped	a	week	of	rumors	that	Georgia-Pacific	,	an	Atlanta-based	forest-products	company	,	was	considering	*-1	making	a	bid	for	Nekoosa	,	a	paper-products	concern	based	*	in	Norwalk	,	Conn	.
Executives	at	Nekoosa	could	n't	be	reached	*-1	,	and	officials	at	Georgia	Pacific	declined	*-2	to	comment	.
Analysts	,	however	,	were	surprised	*-1	because	the	tender	offer	appeared	unsolicited	.
``	It	's	quite	a	bombshell	,	''	said	*T*-1	one	,	*-2	adding	that	the	offer	could	spark	a	period	of	industry	consolidation	.
The	two	companies	would	appear	*-1	to	be	a	logical	fit	because	of	their	complementary	lines	,	and	analysts	described	the	offer	,	representing	a	36	%	premium	over	Nekoosa	's	market	price	,	as	fair	.
Nekoosa	closed	yesterday	at	$	42.75	*U*	,	up	$	2.75	*U*	,	in	New	York	Stock	Exchange	composite	trading	.
But	industry	observers	still	questioned	whether	Georgia	Pacific	will	ultimately	prevail	.
``	You	have	*-2	to	watch	out	for	counterbids	,	''	said	*T*-1	one	analyst	.	``
International	Paper	or	Weyerhaeuser	could	step	in	.	''
The	bid	for	Great	Northern	,	a	notice	of	which	*T*-1	appears	in	an	advertisement	in	today	's	Wall	Street	Journal	,	is	the	first	big	takeover	offer	since	the	collapse	of	a	$	6.79	billion	*U*	buy-out	of	United	Airlines	parent	UAL	Corp.	Oct.	13	.
That	collapse	,	following	on	the	heels	of	disarray	in	the	market	for	high-risk	,	high-yield	bonds	,	cast	doubt	on	the	entire	takeover	business	,	which	*T*-1	has	fueled	both	big	profits	among	Wall	Street	securities	firms	and	big	gains	in	the	stock	market	generally	.
While	Georgia-Pacific	's	stock	has	outperformed	the	market	in	the	past	two	years	,	Nekoosa	has	lagged	the	market	in	the	same	period	.
Yesterday	's	rise	in	Nekoosa	's	share	price	came	on	volume	of	786,700	shares	,	four	times	the	daily	average	.
According	to	Dow	Jones	Professional	Investor	Report	,	options	trading	in	Nekoosa	was	also	heavy	,	*-1	ranking	only	behind	International	Business	Machines	Corp.	and	UAL	in	volume	on	the	Chicago	Board	Options	Exchange	.
According	to	the	Value	Line	Investment	Survey	,	demand	for	Nekoosa	's	commodity	paper	has	weakened	,	*	prompting	earnings	to	decline	by	6.6	%	in	the	third	quarter	ended	Sept.	30	.
Value	Line	added	,	``	With	discounts	*ICH*-1	widening	on	business	papers	,	and	with	newsprint	and	corrugated	shipments	flat	,	we	expect	negative	earnings	comparisons	through	next	year	.	''
By	contrast	,	Value	Line	said	0	Georgia-Pacific	``	is	in	a	comparatively	good	position	*	to	deal	with	weakening	paper	markets	,	''	because	its	production	is	concentrated	*-1	not	in	the	Northwest	but	in	the	South	,	where	it	should	be	able	*-2	to	avoid	some	of	the	cost	pressures	from	rising	wood-chip	prices	*T*-3	.
Also	,	it	is	n't	exposed	*-1	to	the	weakening	newsprint	business	,	and	is	strong	in	the	less-cyclical	tissue	business	.
The	purchase	of	Nekoosa	would	easily	eclipse	Georgia-Pacific	's	$	530	million	*U*	acquisition	of	Brunswick	Pulp	&	Paper	Co.	last	year	.
That	acquisition	,	which	*T*-1	also	included	the	assumption	of	$	135	million	*U*	in	debt	,	was	designed	*-2	*-3	to	allow	Georgia-Pacific	to	capitalize	on	the	strong	demand	for	softwood	pulp	,	as	well	as	reduce	its	exposure	to	the	housing	market	.
Wasserstein	Perella	&	Co.	is	the	dealer-manager	for	the	offer	,	which	*T*-1	will	expire	Nov.	29	,	unless	*-2	extended	*-3	.
Ratners	Group	PLC	's	U.S.	subsidiary	has	agreed	*-1	to	acquire	jewelry	retailer	Weisfield	's	Inc.	for	$	50	*U*	a	share	,	or	about	$	55	million	*U*	.
Weisfield	's	shares	soared	on	the	announcement	yesterday	,	*-1	closing	up	$	11	*U*	*-2	to	close	at	$	50	*U*	in	national	over-the-counter	trading	.
Ratners	and	Weisfield	's	said	0	they	reached	an	agreement	in	principle	for	the	acquisition	of	Weisfield	's	by	Sterling	Inc	.
The	companies	said	0	the	acquisition	is	subject	to	a	definitive	agreement	.
They	said	0	they	expect	the	transaction	to	be	completed	*-1	by	Dec.	15	.
Weisfield	's	,	based	*	in	Seattle	,	Wash.	,	currently	operates	87	specialty	jewelry	stores	in	nine	states	.
In	the	fiscal	year	ended	Jan.	31	,	the	company	reported	sales	of	$	59.5	million	*U*	and	pretax	profit	of	$	2.9	million	*U*	.
Ratners	,	which	*T*-1	controls	25	%	of	the	British	jewelry	market	,	would	increase	the	number	of	its	U.S.	stores	to	about	450	stores	from	360	.
It	has	said	0	it	hopes	*-1	to	control	5	%	of	jewelry	business	in	the	U.S.	by	1992	;	currently	it	controls	about	2	%	.
McDonnell	Douglas	Corp.	received	contracts	totaling	$	244.8	million	*U*	for	72	F-A-18	aircraft	for	the	Navy	and	helicopter	spare	parts	for	the	Army	.
Aerojet	General	Corp.	,	a	unit	of	GenCorp	Inc.	,	was	awarded	*-1	a	$	40.1	million	*U*	Air	Force	contract	for	Minuteman	missile	rocket	motors	.
Rockwell	International	Corp.	received	a	$	26.7	million	*U*	Navy	contract	for	submarine	ballistic	missiles	.
Honeywell	Inc.	got	a	$	22.3	million	*U*	Navy	contract	for	aircraft	missile	warning	sets	.
Beech	Aircraft	Corp.	,	a	unit	of	Raytheon	Co.	,	received	an	$	11.5	million	*U*	Air	Force	contract	for	C-12	aircraft	support	.
Analog	Devices	Inc.	said	0	it	may	purchase	as	many	as	one	million	of	its	common	shares	over	the	next	several	months	.
Analog	also	said	that	a	one	million	share	buy-back	program	announced	*	in	March	is	substantially	complete	.
The	company	,	which	*T*-1	makes	integrated	circuits	and	other	electronic	parts	,	now	has	about	47	million	common	shares	outstanding	.

The	media	's	treatment	of	the	Defense	Department	during	the	Vietnam	War	,	the	Carter	administration	's	denigration	of	the	military	,	and	the	public	scapegoating	of	Lt.	Col.	Oliver	North	have	all	served	*-2	to	emasculate	the	poor	souls	who	*T*-1	live	there	.
The	resulting	haunted	house	tends	*-1	to	reward	followership	,	not	leadership	,	it	creates	guilt	about	*	wearing	the	uniform	,	and	raises	doubt	about	*	having	the	will	*	to	fulfill	the	ghosts	'	role	,	i.e.	,	*	to	be	able	*-2	to	win	if	*	called	on	*-3	.

Mike	Greece	Former	Air	Force	Career	Officer	New	York
Where	does	Mr.	Lehman	get	off	*-1	castigating	Gen.	George	Marshall	for	*-3	muscling	in	on	naval	prerogatives	*T*-2	?
Ever	since	the	days	of	Alfred	Thayer	Mahan	-LRB-	U.S.	naval	officer	and	naval	historian	-RRB-	and	Teddy	Roosevelt	the	Navy	has	been	the	service	most	favored	*	by	Washington	officialdom	.
Mr.	Lehman	overlooks	the	fact	that	the	Navy	possesses	its	own	air	force	-LRB-	the	carrier	fleet	-RRB-	and	its	own	army	-LRB-	the	Marines	-RRB-	,	which	in	turn	*T*-1	has	its	own	air	force	.
Of	course	these	turf	battles	are	unseemly	,	wasteful	and	potentially	dangerous	and	should	be	resolved	*-2	in	the	interest	of	national	security	,	but	Mr.	Lehman	seems	*-1	to	be	part	of	the	problem	rather	than	part	of	the	answer	.
L.H.	Blum	Beaumont	,	Texas
I	agree	with	Mr.	Lehman	100	%	!
Is	n't	this	the	same	guy	who	*T*-1	resigned	as	Navy	secretary	because	he	could	n't	get	his	1,000-ship	Navy	?
I	personally	do	not	want	*-1	to	hasten	Mr.	Lehman	's	demise	,	but	I	can	see	him	figuring	prominently	in	his	own	article	.

For	the	sixth	time	in	as	many	years	,	Continental	Airlines	has	a	new	senior	executive	.
Gone	is	*T*-1	D.	Joseph	Corr	,	the	airline	's	chairman	,	chief	executive	and	president	,	appointed	*	only	last	December	.
Mr.	Corr	resigned	*-1	to	pursue	other	business	interests	,	the	airline	said	0	*T*-2	.
He	could	not	be	reached	*-1	for	comment	.
Succeeding	him	as	chairman	and	chief	executive	will	be	*T*-2	Frank	Lorenzo	,	chairman	and	chief	executive	of	Continental	's	parent	,	Texas	Air	Corp	.
Mr.	Lorenzo	,	49	years	old	,	is	reclaiming	the	job	that	*T*-1	was	his	before	Mr.	Corr	signed	on	.
The	airline	also	named	Mickey	Foret	as	president	.
Mr.	Foret	,	44	,	is	a	15-year	veteran	of	Texas	Air	and	Texas	International	Airlines	,	its	predecessor	.
Most	recently	he	had	been	executive	vice	president	for	planning	and	finance	at	Texas	Air	.
Top	executives	at	Continental	*ICH*-1	have	n't	lasted	long	,	especially	those	recruited	*	from	outside	.
But	Mr.	Corr	's	tenure	was	shorter	than	most	.
The	48-year-old	Mr.	Corr	was	hired	*-1	largely	because	he	was	credited	*-2	with	*-3	returning	Trans	World	Airlines	Inc.	to	profitability	while	he	was	its	president	from	1986	to	1988	.
Before	that	,	he	was	an	executive	with	a	manufacturing	concern	.
At	Continental	he	cut	money-losing	operations	,	which	*T*-1	helped	*-2	produce	a	modest	profit	in	this	year	's	second	quarter	.
But	Mr.	Corr	,	a	stunt	pilot	in	his	spare	time	,	was	understood	*-1	to	be	frustrated	*-2	by	what	he	regarded	*T*-3	as	limited	freedom	under	Mr.	Lorenzo	.
While	*-1	not	officially	an	executive	at	Continental	during	Mr.	Corr	's	tenure	,	Mr.	Lorenzo	is	known	*-1	for	*-2	keeping	close	tabs	on	Texas	Air	's	operating	units	.
Continental	is	Texas	Air	's	flagship	and	was	built	*-1	painfully	to	its	present	size	under	Mr.	Lorenzo	after	*-1	emerging	from	bankruptcy	proceedings	in	1986	.
It	*EXP*-2	's	unclear	what	role	,	if	any	,	Mr.	Lorenzo	's	recent	exploration	of	a	possible	sale	of	a	stake	in	Continental	had	*T*-1	in	Mr.	Corr	's	departure	.
One	source	familiar	with	the	airline	said	,	however	,	that	Mr.	Corr	was	n't	informed	*-1	in	advance	during	the	summer	when	Mr.	Lorenzo	began	discussions	with	potential	buyers	*T*-2	.
During	his	tenure	,	Mr.	Corr	attempted	through	a	series	of	meetings	*-1	to	inform	managers	of	some	of	the	company	's	future	plans	,	traveled	widely	*-1	to	talk	to	employees	and	backed	training	sessions	designed	*	*-2	to	improve	the	carrier	's	image	.
Mr.	Foret	is	one	of	a	handful	of	executives	0	Mr.	Lorenzo	has	relied	on	*T*-1	over	the	years	.
Previously	,	he	had	served	in	financial	planning	positions	at	the	company	's	Eastern	Airlines	unit	.
Another	longtime	ally	,	Phil	Bakes	,	currently	heads	Eastern	,	now	in	Chapter	11	bankruptcy	proceedings	.
Mr.	Bakes	previously	had	a	turn	at	*-1	running	Continental	.
Among	the	other	alumni	are	*T*-1	Stephen	Wolf	,	now	chairman	of	UAL	Inc.	,	and	Thomas	Plaskett	,	president	of	Pan	Am	Corp	.
Doskocil	Cos.	said	0	its	bank-debt	payments	have	been	extended	*-1	until	May	31	,	1990	,	*	to	give	it	more	time	0	*	to	sell	its	Wilson	Foods	Corp.	retail	and	fresh	meat	operations	*T*-2	.
The	company	was	*-1	to	repay	$	58	million	*U*	in	debt	on	Dec.	31	and	$	15	million	*U*	on	March	31	.
The	company	acquired	the	debt	when	it	paid	$	155	million	*U*	*-2	to	purchase	Wilson	last	year	*T*-1	.
An	agreement	*	to	sell	the	Wilson	assets	for	$	150	million	*U*	in	cash	and	notes	collapsed	in	late	September	,	when	the	buyer	,	a	company	controlled	*	by	George	Gillett	,	could	n't	secure	financing	*T*-1	.
Companies	listed	*	below	reported	quarterly	profit	substantially	different	from	the	average	of	analysts	'	estimates	.
The	companies	are	followed	*-1	by	at	least	three	analysts	,	and	had	a	minimum	five-cent	change	in	actual	earnings	per	share	.
Estimated	and	actual	results	involving	losses	are	omitted	*-1	.
The	percent	difference	compares	actual	profit	with	the	30-day	estimate	where	at	least	three	analysts	have	issues	forecasts	in	the	past	30	days	*T*-1	.
Otherwise	,	actual	profit	is	compared	*-1	with	the	300-day	estimate	.
Charles	D	.	Way	,	president	of	this	restaurant	operator	,	assumed	the	additional	post	of	chief	executive	officer	.
He	succeeds	Alvin	A.	McCall	in	the	position	.
Mr.	McCall	will	remain	chairman	.
Australia	's	inflation	is	expected	*-1	to	rise	as	high	as	8.3	%	in	the	quarter	ending	March	30	,	but	could	fall	to	around	7	%	by	June	,	according	to	economists	.
The	government	said	0	the	consumer	price	index	rose	2.3	%	in	the	quarter	ended	Sept.	30	from	the	previous	quarter	and	8	%	from	a	year	ago	.

It	is	a	peaceful	time	in	this	part	of	western	India	.
The	summer	crop	is	harvested	*-1	,	winter	sowing	has	yet	*-2	to	begin	.
Farmers	in	loose	turbans	and	fancy	earrings	spend	their	afternoons	*-1	laughing	and	gossiping	at	the	markets	.
One	could	imagine	such	a	lull	in	the	lives	of	the	Arabs	before	the	quadrupling	of	oil	prices	.
For	just	as	the	Arabs	were	*?*	in	the	1960s	,	the	farmers	of	Sidhpur	are	on	the	brink	of	global	power	and	fame	.
The	Arabs	had	merely	oil	.
These	farmers	may	have	a	grip	on	the	world	's	very	heart	.
Or	,	at	least	,	its	heart	disease	.
That	is	because	Sidhpur	has	a	near-monopoly	on	the	world	's	supply	of	flea	seed	,	also	known	*	as	flea	wort	or	,	in	Western	parlance	,	psyllium	:	a	tiny	,	tasteless	,	obscure	seed	that	,	according	to	early	research	,	*T*-1	may	reduce	cholesterol	levels	in	the	blood	.
Ever	since	the	link	to	cholesterol	was	disclosed	*-1	,	Americans	have	begun	*-2	scarfing	up	psyllium	in	their	breakfast	cereals	.
If	further	research	proves	the	seed	's	benefits	,	this	dusty	farm	district	could	become	the	epicenter	of	a	health-food	fad	0	*T*-1	to	rival	all	fads	since	cod-liver	oil	.
``	This	seed	's	not	grown	*-2	anywhere	else	in	India	,	or	anywhere	else	in	the	world	,	''	says	*T*-1	T.V.	Krishnamurthy	,	a	vice	president	of	Procter	&	Gamble	India	Ltd.	,	a	major	psyllium	buyer	and	promoter	.
``	The	proper	climatic	conditions	do	n't	exist	in	many	places	in	the	world	.	''
Arvind	Patel	,	a	processor	and	exporter	of	the	seed	,	raves	:	``	If	psyllium	takes	the	place	of	oat	bran	,	it	will	be	huge	.	''
Whether	psyllium	makes	Sidhpur	's	fortune	depends	on	cholesterol-fearing	Americans	,	the	U.S.	Food	and	Drug	Administration	and	,	of	course	,	the	outcome	of	further	research	.
Only	one	thing	*ICH*-1	is	certain	here	:	Pysllium	is	likely	*-2	to	remain	solely	an	export	item	from	Sidhpur	for	a	long	time	.
Local	farmers	say	0	it	is	as	good	a	cash	crop	as	mustard	or	fenugreek	,	a	legume	.
But	they	have	no	desire	*	to	eat	a	bowl	of	psyllium	each	morning	,	and	,	perhaps	,	little	need	:	*-1	lean	,	frugal	vegetarians	,	the	farmers	are	innocents	in	the	clogged	,	treacherous	world	of	cholesterol	.
Psyllium	is	an	annual	herb	,	Plantago	ovata	,	that	*T*-2	has	been	used	*-1	for	centuries	by	folk	doctors	here	,	mainly	as	a	laxative	and	anti-diarrheal	.
As	such	,	the	soluble	fiber	has	an	almost	fanatic	following	in	northern	India	.
``	I	can	assure	you	,	''	attests	*T*-1	a	25-year-old	lawyer	in	New	Delhi	,	with	a	meaningfully	raised	eyebrow	,	``	from	personal	experience	,	0	it	works	.	''
A	prominent	businessman	in	Bombay	gives	a	similar	testimonial	:	``	I	have	been	taking	it	daily	since	1961	.
''	Folk	doctors	also	prescribe	it	for	kidney	,	bladder	and	urethra	problems	,	duodenal	ulcers	and	hemorrhoids	.
Some	apply	it	to	gouty	joints	.
The	plant	has	a	hairy	stem	that	*T*-1	produces	flowers	and	diminutive	seeds	.
It	is	the	seed	's	colorlessness	and	size	--	1,000	of	them	weigh	only	1.5	grams	,	or	about	as	much	as	two	paper	clips	--	that	*T*-1	explain	the	historical	allusions	to	fleas	.
The	transluscent	husk	of	the	seed	is	removed	,	sifted	and	crushed	*-1	;	the	seed	itself	is	fed	*-2	to	animals	.
Some	90	%	of	the	crop	,	which	*T*-2	was	worth	$	26	million	*U*	last	year	,	is	exported	*-1	.
For	decades	,	psyllium	husk	has	been	the	main	ingredient	in	such	laxatives	as	Procter	&	Gamble	Co.	's	Metamucil	,	the	top-selling	brand	in	the	U.S.	,	and	Ciba-Geigy	Corp.	's	Fiberall	.
But	some	time	ago	,	researchers	discovered	that	soluble	fibers	also	lower	cholesterol	levels	in	the	blood	.
Cincinnati-based	P&G	took	an	interest	;	it	ordered	two	studies	on	psyllium	and	cholesterol	.
One	of	the	studies	,	done	*	at	the	University	of	Minnesota	,	tested	75	people	with	raised	cholesterol	levels	.
After	16	weeks	,	the	group	that	*T*-1	took	three	daily	teaspoons	of	Metamucil	saw	a	significant	dip	in	their	general	cholesterol	levels	,	and	an	even	larger	reduction	in	levels	of	low-density	lipoproteins	,	the	so-called	bad	cholesterol	.
In	late	1987	,	P&G	asked	the	FDA	for	approval	*	to	market	Metamucil	as	the	first	non-prescription	,	cholesterol-lowering	product	in	the
In	April	,	the	psyllium	bandwagon	got	more	crowded	.
General	Mills	Inc.	,	the	food	giant	,	launched	a	breakfast	cereal	called	*	Benefit	,	containing	psyllium	,	oat	,	wheat	and	beet	bran	;	the	words	,	``	*	reduce	cholesterol	''	were	prominently	displayed	*-1	on	its	package	.
In	September	,	Kellogg	Co.	launched	a	competing	psyllium-fortified	cereal	called	*	Heartwise	.
Suddenly	,	on	television	,	in	advertisements	and	on	their	cereal	boxes	,	Americans	were	inundated	*-1	with	news	about	the	obscure	seed	.
The	flood	of	claims	and	counter-claims	worried	consumers	and	actually	hurt	sales	of	the	new	cereals	.
This	month	,	the	Food	and	Drug	Administration	expressed	concern	that	Americans	might	someday	,	in	various	forms	,	ingest	too	much	psyllium	.
Currently	,	there	is	a	lull	in	the	psyllium	war	.
The	FDA	has	asked	Kellogg	and	General	Mills	to	show	research	that	their	cereals	are	safe	.
It	also	ordered	P&G	to	produce	more	studies	0	*T*-1	to	buttress	its	claims	that	Metamucil	can	lower	cholesterol	.
But	the	agency	has	n't	yanked	psyllium	off	store	shelves	.
If	the	FDA	approves	the	new	uses	of	psyllium	,	other	companies	are	expected	*-1	to	rush	to	market	with	psyllium	products	.
``	It	's	going	*-1	to	be	a	sensational	thing	,	''	says	*T*-2	Mr.	Krishnamurthy	of	P&G	in	Bombay	.
Says	*ICH*-1	psyllium	exporter	Mr.	Patel	:	``	I	just	got	back	yesterday	from	the	U.S.	.
In	the	newspapers	,	on	the	radio	and	TV	,	psyllium	is	everywhere	.	''
But	the	news	of	the	boom	has	yet	*-1	to	trickle	down	to	the	farmers	.
They	only	know	of	one	use	for	the	crop	,	as	a	laxative	,	and	with	psyllium	prices	currently	languishing	in	the	wake	of	a	bumper	crop	,	they	think	of	the	seed	as	a	marginal	crop	,	something	0	*	to	grow	*T*-1	between	summer	wheat	crops	.
``	Psyllium	's	not	a	good	crop	,	''	complains	Sooraji	Jath	,	a	26-year-old	farmer	from	the	village	of	Lakshmipura	.	``
You	get	a	rain	at	the	wrong	time	and	the	crop	is	ruined	*-1	.	''
Even	at	the	Basic	Chemicals	,	Pharmaceuticals	and	Cosmetics	Export	Promotion	Council	,	the	government	agency	that	*T*-1	promotes	the	seed	,	the	psyllium	boom	is	distant	thunder	.
The	staff	brags	about	psyllium	's	hefty	contribution	to	American	regularity	,	without	*-1	quite	grasping	the	implications	of	the	research	on	cholesterol	.
The	council	's	annual	report	has	psyllium	on	its	last	page	,	*-2	lumped	*-3	with	such	unglamorous	export	items	as	sarsaparilla	and	``	Nux	vomica	,	''	a	plant	that	*T*-1	induces	vomiting	.
In	one	way	,	the	psyllium	middlemen	--	the	buyers	and	exporters	--	are	glad	*-1	to	keep	news	of	the	boom	to	themselves	.
They	want	psyllium	prices	low	for	their	purchases	next	year	.
But	there	's	a	catch	.
Sidhpur	and	adjacent	districts	are	the	only	places	in	the	world	where	psyllium	is	grown	*-1	in	large	quantities	*T*-2	.
This	is	partly	due	to	the	particular	demands	of	the	crop	.
Psyllium	needs	sandy	soil	,	dew	during	the	first	few	weeks	,	and	then	total	dryness	when	its	seeds	are	maturing	*T*-1	.
Small	crops	are	grown	*-1	in	Pakistan	,	France	,	Spain	,	Italy	,	Belgium	and	Brazil	,	but	their	quality	ca	n't	compare	to	that	of	Indian	psyllium	.
Big	buyers	like	Procter	&	Gamble	say	0	there	are	other	spots	on	the	globe	,	and	in	India	,	where	the	seed	could	be	grown	*-1	*T*-2	.
``	It	's	not	a	crop	that	*T*-1	ca	n't	be	doubled	or	tripled	*-2	,	''	says	*T*-3	Mr.	Krishnamurthy	.
But	no	one	has	made	a	serious	effort	*	to	transplant	the	crop	.
In	Sidhpur	,	it	is	almost	time	0	*	to	sow	this	year	's	crop	*T*-1	.
Many	farmers	,	too	removed	*	to	glean	psyllium	's	new	sparkle	in	the	West	,	have	decided	*-1	to	plant	mustard	,	fennel	,	cumin	,	fenugreek	or	castor-oil	seeds	.
Mr.	Jath	is	thinking	of	*-1	passing	up	psyllium	altogether	this	year	in	favor	of	a	crop	with	a	future	such	as	cumin	or	fennel	.
``	Maybe	I	'll	plant	castor-oil	seeds	.	''
His	brother	,	Parkhaji	,	whose	head	*T*-2	is	swathed	*-1	in	a	gorgeous	crimson	turban	,	nods	vigorous	assent	.
So	when	next	year	's	psyllium	crop	is	harvested	*-1	in	March	*T*-2	,	it	may	be	smaller	than	the	16,000	metric	tons	of	the	past	few	years	--	right	at	the	crest	of	the	psyllium	boom	.
And	the	world	could	experience	its	first	psyllium	shortage	.
Kellwood	Co.	said	0	it	completed	a	previously	announced	acquisition	of	Crowntuft	Manufacturing	Corp.	,	a	New	York-based	maker	of	chenille	robes	and	lounge	wear	.
The	apparel	maker	would	n't	disclose	terms	of	the	agreement	.

Seats	currently	are	quoted	*-1	at	$	410,000	*U*	bid	*	,	$	425,000	*U*	asked	*	.

Small	businesses	say	0	a	recent	trend	is	like	a	dream	come	true	:	more-affordable	rates	for	employee-health	insurance	,	initially	at	least	.
But	then	they	wake	up	to	a	nightmare	.
The	reasonable	first-year	rates	can	be	followed	*-1	by	increases	of	60	%	or	more	if	a	covered	employee	files	a	major	claim	,	they	complain	*T*-2	.
Insurance	premiums	for	one	small	Maryland	concern	went	up	130	%	in	less	than	two	years	,	the	last	increase	coming	after	one	of	its	three	workers	developed	a	herniated	disk	.
``	There	's	a	distinct	possibility	that	I	may	lose	my	job	over	this	,	''	the	employee	,	Karen	Allen	,	of	Floor	Covering	Resources	,	Kensington	,	Md.	,	recently	told	a	congressional	hearing	*T*-1	.
She	said	0	her	employer	ca	n't	afford	the	rate	increases	,	and	she	fears	0	she	wo	n't	find	another	job	with	a	benefit	plan	covering	her	ailment	.
For	employee	and	employer	alike	,	the	worry	is	widespread	.
Surveys	repeatedly	show	that	small-business	owners	rank	the	availability	*RNR*-1	and	rising	cost	*RNR*-1	of	health	insurance	as	one	of	their	biggest	concerns	.
The	House	Energy	and	Commerce	Committee	's	health	subcommittee	,	headed	*	by	Democratic	Rep.	Henry	Waxman	of	California	,	is	looking	into	complaints	that	small	businesses	not	only	ca	n't	keep	reasonably	priced	employee-health	insurance	if	claims	are	filed	*-1	,	but	often	ca	n't	get	coverage	at	all	if	a	worker	is	termed	*-2	medically	uninsurable	.
``	I	have	an	old-fashioned	name	for	people	in	that	position	:	sick	people	who	*T*-1	need	health	insurance	,	''	Rep.	Waxman	says	*T*-2	.	``
What	we	're	seeing	*T*-1	now	makes	a	mockery	of	the	idea	of	insurance	:	*	collect	premiums	from	the	healthy	,	dump	the	sick	and	let	them	pay	their	own	bills	.	''
Some	lawmakers	may	seek	legislation	0	*	to	limit	overly	restrictive	insurance	policies	*T*-1	.
The	concern	grows	out	of	increased	efforts	*ICH*-1	by	the	insurers	*	to	woo	the	small-business	market	.
As	larger	companies	increasingly	self-insure	,	or	use	reserves	*-2	to	pay	their	own	workers	'	medical	bills	,	the	insurance	industry	has	turned	to	the	small-employer	market	that	*T*-1	was	once	a	backwater	for	them	.
``	Insurance	companies	will	offer	a	good	rate	if	no	one	is	sick	,	but	it	's	a	roll	of	the	dice	,	''	says	Rosemary	Heinhold	of	the	Small	Business	Service	Bureau	,	a	group	representing	35,000	small	businesses	nationwide	.
``	One	case	of	cancer	or	a	high-risk	pregnancy	with	a	sick	infant	,	and	rates	go	up	40	%	to	60	%	*U*	.
Small-business	people	end	up	*-1	paying	insurance	premiums	worth	two	to	three	times	the	cost	of	one	illness	.	''
In	addition	,	the	group	says	0	some	of	its	member	companies	have	been	denied	*-1	insurance	because	individual	workers	had	medical	problems	that	*T*-2	ranged	from	a	mild	cardiac	condition	to	psychological	counseling	after	a	divorce	,	hemorrhoids	and	overweight	.
The	Health	Insurance	Association	of	America	,	an	insurers	'	trade	group	,	acknowledges	that	stiff	competition	*ICH*-1	among	its	members	*	to	insure	businesses	likely	*	to	be	good	risks	during	the	first	year	of	coverage	has	aggravated	the	problem	in	the	small-business	market	.
But	it	says	that	rapid	rate	increases	are	directly	tied	to	the	soaring	cost	of	health	care	.
Some	business	analysts	blame	the	problem	on	tough	competition	in	the	insurance	market	.
They	say	0	insurance	companies	use	policies	aimed	*	at	*	excluding	bad	risks	because	their	competitors	do	*?*	.
But	the	general	practice	makes	it	*EXP*-1	more	difficult	*	to	combine	small	groups	of	people	into	larger	groups	,	thus	*-2	spreading	the	risk	over	a	larger	base	of	premiums	.
``	I	'm	not	accusing	insurers	of	dereliction	of	duty	,	''	Robert	Patricelli	of	the	U.S.	Chamber	of	Commerce	told	Mr.	Waxman	's	panel	*T*-1	.
``	You	ca	n't	ask	one	carrier	to	underwrite	on	social	grounds	when	that	might	destroy	it	in	the	marketplace	*T*-1	.	''
Rep.	Waxman	and	Democratic	Sen.	Edward	Kennedy	of	Massachusetts	have	proposed	regulation	0	*T*-1	to	deal	with	the	problem	.
The	proposal	is	just	part	of	legislation	that	*T*-1	would	require	businesses	to	provide	health	benefits	,	an	idea	that	*T*-2	is	strongly	opposed	*-4	by	small	business	who	*T*-3	say	0	it	would	just	compound	the	insurance-cost	problems	.
But	small-business	lobbyists	say	0	they	support	the	idea	,	included	*	in	the	Kennedy-Waxman	bill	,	of	new	laws	or	regulations	requiring	greater	use	of	community	rating	,	which	*T*-2	pegs	rates	to	the	use	of	health	care	by	a	community	or	other	large	group	,	and	*T*-2	is	designed	*-3	*-1	to	prevent	insurance	companies	from	*-4	taking	only	low-risk	small	companies	as	clients	.
But	first	on	the	list	of	priorities	,	says	0	*T*-2	the	National	Federation	of	Independent	Business	,	is	*T*-1	*	to	prohibit	state	laws	requiring	the	inclusion	of	specialty	items	,	such	as	psychiatric	care	,	in	basic	health	plans	.
Such	requirements	,	they	argue	0	*T*-1	,	make	it	*EXP*-2	difficult	*	to	provide	a	basic	,	low-cost	health-benefits	package	.
``	Before	the	state	of	Wisconsin	mandated	that	mental-health	care	be	covered	*-1	,	there	were	only	70	mental-health	clinics	in	the	state	;	now	there	are	400	,	''	says	*T*-2	Carolyn	Miller	,	an	NFIB	lobbyist	.
She	contends	that	similar	mandates	have	driven	up	insurance	costs	20	%	in	Maryland	and	30	%	in	California	.
The	insurance-industry	association	also	strongly	disagrees	with	the	proposed	community	rating	,	which	``	*T*-1	does	n't	save	one	dollar	,	''	argues	*T*-2	James	Dorsch	,	HIAA	's	Washington	counsel	.

Nashua	Corp.	,	rumored	*	a	potential	takeover	target	for	six	months	,	said	that	a	Dutch	company	has	sought	U.S.	approval	*	to	buy	up	to	25	%	of	Nashua	's	shares	.
Nashua	immediately	responded	by	*-1	strengthening	a	poison-pill	plan	and	saying	0	it	will	buy	back	up	to	one	million	of	its	shares	,	or	10.4	%	of	the	9.6	million	outstanding	.
Nashua	,	whose	major	business	*T*-1	is	*	selling	copiers	,	facsimile	machines	and	related	supplies	,	said	0	Reiss	&	Co	.

Mr.	Junius	said	0	Nashua	's	``	intention	is	*	to	remain	an	independent	public	company	.	''

In	addition	,	the	company	's	board	authorized	the	purchase	of	up	to	an	additional	one	million	shares	.
Under	a	program	approved	*	by	the	company	in	1987	that	*T*-1	did	n't	specify	a	share	amount	,	Nashua	had	purchased	481,000	shares	through	Sept.	29	.
Alex	Henderson	,	an	analyst	at	Prudential-Bache	Securities	,	said	that	while	Nashua	's	performance	this	year	has	been	``	atrocious	,	''	the	company	nonetheless	is	attractive	as	a	``	classic	breakup	candidate	because	there	's	no	similarity	between	its	-LCB-	four	-RCB-	businesses	.	''

In	the	aftermath	of	the	Beijing	massacre	on	June	4	,	economists	advanced	wildly	divergent	views	on	how	Hong	Kong	would	be	affected	*-1	*T*-2	.
Among	the	most	upbeat	was	*T*-1	BT	Brokerage	-LRB-	Asia	-RRB-	Ltd	.
In	a	June	5	reaction	,	the	Bankers	Trust	Co.	unit	proclaimed	the	economy	``	shockproof	.	''

Today	,	with	business	activity	in	Hong	Kong	staggering	along	at	an	uneven	pace	,	the	economy	itself	seems	*-1	locked	*-2	in	a	struggle	between	hope	and	fear	.
Manufacturers	have	survived	the	turmoil	in	China	*-1	largely	unscathed	.
Signs	of	revival	seem	evident	in	Hong	Kong	's	hard-hit	hotel	sector	.
But	in	the	stock	and	real-estate	markets	,	activity	remains	spotty	even	though	prices	have	regained	much	of	their	lost	ground	.
Waning	demand	reported	*	by	importers	,	retailers	and	even	fancy	restaurants	all	reinforce	a	profile	of	a	community	that	*T*-1	is	sharply	tightening	its	belt	.
As	many	economists	and	businessmen	see	it	,	those	incongruities	underscore	a	paradox	that	*T*-1	seems	likely	*-2	to	bedevil	the	economy	throughout	the	1990s	.
That	paradox	is	Hong	Kong	's	economically	rewarding	yet	politically	perilous	relationship	with	China	.
As	a	model	of	capitalist	efficiency	on	southern	China	's	doorstep	,	Hong	Kong	's	prospects	look	good	.
China	's	land	and	labor	offer	inexpensive	alternatives	to	local	industry	.
China-bound	freight	streams	through	the	territory	's	port	.
In	the	decade	since	the	communist	nation	emerged	from	isolation	,	its	burgeoning	trade	with	the	West	has	lifted	Hong	Kong	's	status	as	a	regional	business	center	.
These	benefits	seem	secure	despite	China	's	current	economic	and	political	troubles	.
But	to	Hong	Kong	,	China	is	n't	purely	business	.
It	is	also	the	sovereign	power	that	,	come	1997	,	*T*-1	will	take	over	this	British	colony	.
China	's	leaders	have	promised	generous	liberties	for	post-1997	Hong	Kong	.
That	promise	sounds	shaky	now	that	those	same	leaders	have	fallen	back	on	Marxist	dogma	and	brute	force	*-1	to	crush	their	nation	's	democracy	movement	.
Outflows	of	people	and	capital	from	Hong	Kong	have	been	growing	since	the	sovereignty	issue	first	arose	in	the	early	1980s	.
A	widely	held	assumption	all	along	has	been	that	,	given	its	robust	economy	,	Hong	Kong	will	be	able	*-1	to	attract	sufficient	foreign	money	and	talent	*-2	to	comfortably	offset	the	outflows	.
With	interest	in	emigration	and	investment	abroad	soaring	since	June	4	,	that	assumption	no	longer	seems	so	safe	.
Investment	and	emigration	plans	take	time	*-1	to	come	to	fruition	.
Only	four	months	have	passed	since	the	Beijing	massacre	,	and	few	are	prepared	*-1	to	predict	its	ultimate	impact	.
The	only	consensus	is	that	more	money	and	people	*ICH*-2	may	leave	Hong	Kong	than	*	had	been	thought	*-1	likely	.
This	expected	blow	has	cast	a	pall	over	the	economy	's	prospects	.
The	question	,	as	many	people	see	it	,	is	how	long	such	uncertainty	will	last	*T*-1	.
Maureen	Fraser	,	an	economist	with	W.I.	Carr	,	a	subsidiary	of	France	's	Banque	Indosuez	,	believes	that	the	territory	may	not	be	able	*-1	to	regain	its	momentum	until	some	time	after	1997	.
It	may	experience	an	upswing	or	two	in	between	.
But	with	local	investors	shaken	*-1	by	China	's	political	and	economic	turmoil	,	she	says	0	*T*-2	,	a	genuine	recovery	may	not	arrive	until	Hong	Kong	can	prove	itself	secure	under	Chinese	sovereignty	.
``	Investors	have	*-1	to	accept	the	possibility	of	a	significant	slowdown	in	economic	activity	in	the	runup	to	1997	,	''	she	says	*T*-2	.
``	Over	the	next	few	years	,	I	would	advise	caution	.	''
In	a	soon-to-be	published	book	on	the	territory	,	a	political	economist	,	Miron	Mushkat	,	has	derived	three	future	scenarios	from	interviews	with	41	Hong	Kong	government	officials	and	businessmen	.
Nearly	half	of	them	argue	that	Hong	Kong	's	uneasy	relationship	with	China	will	constrain	*RNR*-1	--	though	not	inhibit	*RNR*-1	--	long-term	economic	growth	.
The	rest	are	split	*-1	roughly	between	optimists	who	*T*-2	expect	Hong	Kong	to	hum	along	as	*-4	*?*	before	and	pessimists	who	*T*-3	foresee	irreparable	chaos	.
The	interviews	took	place	two	years	ago	.
Since	the	China	crisis	erupted	,	Mr.	Mushkat	says	0	*T*-2	,	the	scenario	as	0	*-4	depicted	*-3	by	the	middle-of-the-road	group	bears	a	remarkable	resemblance	to	the	difficulties	0	Hong	Kong	currently	faces	*T*-1	.
The	consensus	of	this	group	,	which	he	dubs	*T*-1	``	realists	,	''	is	that	the	local	economy	will	grow	through	the	1990s	at	annual	rates	averaging	between	3	%	and	5	%	*U*	.
Such	a	pace	of	growth	,	though	*-1	respectable	for	mature	industrialized	economies	,	would	be	unusually	slow	for	Hong	Kong	.
Only	twice	since	the	1960s	has	annual	gross	domestic	product	growth	here	fallen	below	5	%	for	two	or	more	consecutive	years	.
The	first	instance	occurred	in	1967-68	,	when	China	's	Cultural	Revolution	triggered	bloody	street	rioting	in	the	colony	*T*-1	.
The	other	came	in	1974-75	from	the	combined	shock	of	world	recession	and	a	severe	local	stock	market	crash	.
During	the	past	10	years	,	Hong	Kong	's	economic	growth	has	averaged	8.3	%	annually	.
Given	Hong	Kong	's	record	,	Mr.	Mushkat	's	``	realists	''	might	have	sounded	unduly	conservative	when	the	interviews	took	place	two	years	ago	*T*-2	.
Under	the	current	circumstances	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	,	their	scenario	no	longer	seems	unrealistic	.
``	The	city	could	lose	some	of	its	entrepreneurial	flavor	.
It	could	lose	some	of	its	dynamism	,	''	says	*T*-1	Mr.	Mushkat	,	a	director	of	Baring	Securities	-LRB-	Hong	Kong	-RRB-	Ltd.	,	a	unit	of	Britain	's	Barings	PLC	.	``
It	does	n't	have	*-1	to	be	a	disaster	.
It	just	means	that	Hong	Kong	would	become	a	less	exciting	place	.	''
*-2	Going	by	official	forecasts	of	GDP	,	which	*T*-1	measures	the	colony	's	output	of	goods	and	services	,	minus	foreign	income	,	Mr.	Mushkat	's	``	realists	''	seem	relatively	close	to	the	mark	.
After	*-1	taking	into	account	the	fallout	from	the	China	crisis	,	the	government	has	projected	1989	GDP	growth	of	5	%	.
The	updated	forecast	,	published	*	Aug.	25	,	compares	with	an	earlier	forecast	of	6	%	published	*	March	1	and	a	7.4	%	rate	achieved	*	in
Sir	Piers	Jacobs	,	Hong	Kong	's	financial	secretary	,	says	0	a	further	downward	revision	may	be	justified	*-1	unless	the	economy	stages	a	more	convincing	rally	.
``	We	are	n't	looking	at	anything	like	a	doomsday	scenario	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	But	clearly	we	're	entering	a	difficult	period	.	''
Many	factors	besides	a	dread	of	1997	will	have	a	bearing	on	Hong	Kong	's	economy	.
One	concerns	Japanese	investors	.
*-1	Barely	visible	on	Hong	Kong	's	property	scene	in	1985	,	by	last	year	Japan	had	become	the	top	foreign	investor	,	*-1	spending	$	602	million	*U*	.
The	market	has	grown	relatively	quiet	since	the	China	crisis	.
But	if	the	Japanese	return	in	force	,	their	financial	might	could	compensate	to	some	extent	for	local	investors	'	waning	commitment	.
Another	--	and	critical	--	factor	is	the	U.S.	,	Hong	Kong	's	biggest	export	market	.
Even	before	the	China	crisis	,	weak	U.S.	demand	was	slowing	local	economic	growth	.
Conversely	,	strong	consumer	spending	in	the	U.S.	two	years	ago	helped	*-1	propel	the	local	economy	at	more	than	twice	its	current	rate	.
Indeed	,	a	few	economists	maintain	that	global	forces	will	continue	*-1	to	govern	Hong	Kong	's	economic	rhythm	.
Once	external	conditions	,	such	as	U.S.	demand	,	swing	in	the	territory	's	favor	,	they	argue	0	*T*-1	,	local	businessmen	will	probably	overcome	their	1997	worries	and	continue	*-2	doing	business	as	usual	.
But	economic	arguments	,	however	solid	,	wo	n't	necessarily	impress	Hong	Kong	's	5.7	million	people	.
Many	are	refugees	,	*-1	having	fled	China	's	unending	cycles	of	political	repression	and	poverty	since	the	Communist	Party	took	power	in	1949	.
As	a	result	,	many	of	those	now	planning	*	to	leave	Hong	Kong	ca	n't	easily	be	swayed	*-1	by	momentary	improvements	in	the	colony	's	political	and	economic	climate	.
Emigration	applications	soared	in	1985	,	when	Britain	and	China	ratified	their	accord	on	Hong	Kong	's	future	*T*-1	.
In	1987	,	Hong	Kong	's	most	prosperous	year	for	a	decade	,	30,000	*ICH*-1	left	,	up	58	%	from	the	previous	year	.
Last	year	,	45,000	went	.
The	government	predicts	that	annual	outflows	will	level	off	over	the	next	few	years	at	as	much	as	60,000	--	a	projection	that	*T*-1	is	widely	regarded	*-2	as	unrealistically	low	.
A	large	number	of	those	leaving	are	managers	and	professionals	.
While	no	one	professes	*-1	to	know	the	exact	cost	of	such	a	``	brain	drain	''	to	the	economy	,	hardly	anyone	doubts	that	it	poses	a	threat	.
``	When	the	economy	loses	a	big	portion	of	its	work	force	that	*T*-2	also	happens	*-6	to	include	its	most	productive	members	*T*-5	,	economic	growth	is	bound	*-3	to	be	affected	*-1	,	''	says	*T*-4	Anthong	Wong	,	an	economist	with	Hang	Seng	Bank	.
While	Wall	Street	is	retreating	from	computer-driven	program	trading	,	big	institutional	investors	are	likely	*-1	to	continue	these	strategies	at	full	blast	,	*-2	further	roiling	the	stock	market	,	trading	executives	say	0	*T*-3	.
*-1	Bowing	to	a	mounting	public	outcry	,	three	more	major	securities	firms	--	Bear	,	Stearns	&	Co.	Inc.	,	Morgan	Stanley	&	Co.	and	Oppenheimer	&	Co.	--	announced	Friday	0	they	would	suspend	stock-index	arbitrage	trading	for	their	own	accounts	.
PaineWebber	Group	Inc.	announced	a	pullback	*ICH*-1	on	Thursday	from	stock-index	arbitrage	,	a	controversial	program-trading	strategy	blamed	*	by	many	investors	for	*	encouraging	big	stock-market	swings	.
Though	the	trading	halts	are	offered	*-1	as	a	sign	of	concern	about	recent	stock	market	volatility	,	most	Wall	Street	firms	remain	open	*-2	to	handle	program	trading	for	customers	.
Trading	executives	privately	say	that	huge	stock-index	funds	,	which	*T*-1	dwarf	Wall	Street	firms	in	terms	of	the	size	of	their	program	trades	,	will	continue	*-2	to	launch	big	programs	through	the	stock	market	.
Wells	Fargo	Investment	Advisers	,	Bankers	Trust	Co.	and	Mellon	Capital	Management	are	among	the	top	stock-index	arbitrage	clients	of	Wall	Street	,	trading	executives	say	*T*-1	.
These	huge	stock-index	funds	build	portfolios	that	*T*-1	match	the	S&P	500	stock	index	or	other	stock	indexes	,	and	frequently	swap	between	stocks	and	futures	*-2	to	capture	profits	.
``	They	will	do	it	every	chance	0	they	get	*T*-2	,	''	said	*T*-1	one	program-trading	executive	.
Consequently	,	abrupt	swings	in	the	stock	market	are	not	likely	*-1	to	disappear	anytime	soon	,	they	say	0	*T*-2	.
In	fact	,	without	Wall	Street	firms	trading	for	their	own	accounts	,	the	stock-index	arbitrage	trading	opportunities	for	the	big	funds	may	be	all	the	more	abundant	.
``	More	customers	may	come	to	us	now	,	''	said	*T*-1	James	Cayne	,	president	of	Bear	Stearns	Cos	.
Executives	who	*T*-1	manage	these	funds	see	the	current	debate	over	program	trading	as	a	repeat	of	the	concern	expressed	*	after	the	1987	crash	.
They	noted	that	studies	completed	*	after	the	1987	crash	exonerated	program	trading	as	a	source	of	volatility	.
``	The	issues	that	*T*-1	are	-LRB-	now	-RRB-	being	raised	*-3	,	in	classic	anti-intellectual	fashion	,	fly	in	the	face	of	a	number	of	post-crash	studies	,	''	said	*T*-2	Fred	Grauer	,	chairman	of	Wells	Fargo	Investment	Advisers	.
A	Bankers	Trust	spokesman	said	that	the	company	's	investment	arm	uses	stock-index	arbitrage	*-1	to	enhance	investors	'	returns	.
Officials	at	Mellon	Capital	were	unavailable	for	comment	.
Stock-index	funds	have	grown	in	popularity	over	the	past	decade	as	pension	funds	and	other	institutional	investors	have	sought	a	low-cost	way	0	*	to	match	the	performance	of	the	stock	market	as	a	whole	*T*-1	.
Many	money	managers	who	*T*-501	trade	stock	actively	have	trouble	*	consistently	matching	the	S&P-500	's	returns	.
Some	stock-index	funds	are	huge	.
Wells	Fargo	Investment	Advisers	,	for	example	,	managed	$	25	billion	*U*	in	stock	investments	*-1	tracking	the	S&P	500	at	the	end	of	June	,	according	to	Standard	&	Poor	's	Corp	.
Mr.	Grauer	said	0	$	2	billion	*U*	of	that	is	used	*-1	in	active	index	arbitrage	.
Stock-index	funds	frequently	use	the	futures	markets	as	a	hedging	tool	,	but	that	is	a	far	less	aggressive	strategy	than	stock-index	arbitrage	,	in	which	traders	buy	and	sell	big	blocks	of	stocks	with	offsetting	trades	in	stock-index	futures	*-2	to	profit	from	price	differences	*T*-1	.
The	190-point	plunge	in	the	stock	market	Oct.	13	has	heightened	concerns	about	volatility	.
And	while	signs	of	an	economic	slowdown	,	softer	corporate	earnings	and	troubles	with	takeover	financing	all	have	contributed	to	the	stock	market	's	recent	weakness	,	many	investors	rushed	*-1	to	blame	program	trading	for	aggravating	market	swings	.
The	Wall	Street	firms	'	pullback	followed	their	recent	blacklisting	by	several	institutional	investors	.
Last	Tuesday	,	Kemper	Corp.	's	Kemper	Financial	Services	Inc.	unit	said	0	it	would	no	longer	trade	with	firms	committed	*	to	stock-index	arbitrage	,	including	the	three	that	*T*-1	later	suspended	stock-index	arbitrage	trading	on	Friday	.
Phoenix	Mutual	Life	Insurance	Co.	and	Founders	Asset	Management	Inc.	also	cut	off	brokerage	firms	that	*T*-1	engage	in	program	trading	.
Though	it	is	still	doing	stock-index	arbitrage	trades	for	customers	,	Morgan	Stanley	's	trading	halt	for	its	own	account	is	likely	*-2	to	shake	up	firms	such	as	Kidder	,	Peabody	&	Co.	that	*T*-1	still	do	such	trades	for	their	own	account	.
Morgan	Stanley	has	consistently	been	one	of	the	top	stock-index	arbitrage	traders	in	recent	months	.
Indeed	,	Morgan	Stanley	's	president	,	Richard	B.	Fisher	,	said	0	the	firm	is	putting	up	money	0	*	to	form	a	group	of	regulators	,	investors	and	investment	banks	*T*-2	*-1	to	find	out	if	stock-index	arbitrage	artificially	induces	stock-market	volatility	.
``	We	have	*-3	to	clear	up	these	issues	and	find	out	what	*ICH*-5	*T*-2	is	present	that	*T*-1	is	creating	artificial	volatility	,	''	Mr.	Fisher	said	0	*T*-4	.
``	There	is	no	question	that	investor	confidence	-LRB-	in	the	stock	market	-RRB-	is	critical	.	''
*-2	Joining	the	call	for	some	kind	of	study	or	regulatory	action	,	Merrill	Lynch	&	Co.	recommended	program-trading	reforms	*ICH*-1	late	Friday	,	including	higher	margins	on	stock-index	futures	and	greater	regulatory	coordination	.
Separately	,	Mr.	Cayne	of	Bear	Stearns	said	0	his	firm	is	working	with	regulators	*-1	to	balance	margin	requirements	*-2	to	``	enhance	stabilization	.	''
Margin	rules	determine	the	minimum	amount	of	cash	0	an	investor	must	put	up	*T*-1	when	*-2	buying	a	security	*T*-3	.
Current	rules	permit	investors	to	put	up	less	cash	for	futures	than	for	stocks	.
Some	observers	say	that	different	rules	governing	stock	and	futures	markets	are	partly	responsible	for	volatility	.
These	rules	,	they	say	0	*T*-2	,	permit	faster	and	cheaper	trading	in	futures	than	in	stocks	,	which	*T*-1	frequently	knocks	the	two	markets	out	of	line	.
Stock-index	arbitrage	,	because	it	sells	the	more	``	expensive	''	market	and	buys	the	``	cheaper	''	one	,	attempts	*-1	to	reestablish	the	link	between	the	stock	and	futures	markets	,	and	the	adjustments	are	often	abrupt	.
But	unequal	trading	rules	allow	the	futures	market	to	trade	differently	from	stocks	,	which	*T*-1	invites	frequent	bouts	of	stock-index	arbitrage	in	the	first	place	.
``	There	has	*-1	to	be	better	coordination	on	a	regulatory	basis	,	''	said	*T*-2	Christopher	Pedersen	,	director	of	trading	at	Twenty-First	Securities	Corp	.
``	One	agency	should	have	the	authority	over	all	equity	products	.
Like	so	many	trends	in	the	entertainment	industry	,	the	current	spate	of	rape	dramas	on	television	seems	*-1	to	represent	a	confluence	of	high-mindedness	and	self-interest	.
The	former	comes	from	the	latest	wave	of	political	activism	in	Hollywood	,	especially	around	feminist	issues	such	as	abortion	.
The	latter	comes	from	the	perception	*ICH*-1	,	on	the	part	of	many	people	in	network	TV	,	that	their	only	hope	of	*	keeping	viewers	from	*-2	defecting	to	cable	is	*	to	fill	the	airwaves	with	an	increasingly	raw	sensationalism	.
*	Put	these	together	,	and	you	get	programs	about	rape	.
The	best	of	the	crop	was	last	week	's	season	premiere	of	``	In	the	Heat	of	the	Night	,	''	the	NBC	series	based	on	a	1967	feature	film	about	a	black	Philadelphia	police	detective	in	a	small	Southern	town	.
In	the	series	,	Virgil	Tibbs	-LRB-	Howard	Rollins	-RRB-	and	his	wife	,	Althea	-LRB-	Anne-Marie	Johnson	-RRB-	have	settled	in	Sparta	,	Miss	.
Because	the	show	has	acquired	a	sense	of	place	by	*	being	filmed	*-1	on	location	in	Georgia	,	this	episode	--	in	which	Althea	gets	raped	*-2	by	an	arrogant	white	schoolteacher	*T*-3	--	does	a	decent	job	of	*-4	tracing	the	social	repercussions	of	the	crime	.
Obviously	,	it	*EXP*-1	's	harder	*	to	establish	a	sense	of	place	in	a	one-shot	TV	movie	.
But	tonight	's	offering	,	``	*	Settle	the	Score	''	-LRB-	9-11	p.m.	EST	,	on	NBC	-RRB-	,	does	n't	even	try	*?*	.
This	tale	of	a	Chicago	policewoman	returning	home	*	to	find	the	man	who	*T*-2	raped	her	20	years	earlier	is	supposed	*-3	to	be	set	*-1	in	the	Ozarks	.
But	it	's	more	like	an	illustration	of	what	*ICH*-2	Ben	Stein	describes	*T*-1	in	his	study	of	social	attitudes	in	the	TV	industry	:	``	Fear	of	violence	and	animosity	...	because	of	race	or	religion	,	fear	and	lack	of	comprehension	about	the	politics	of	small-town	people	...	produce	a	powerful	wave	of	dislike	of	small	towns	in	the	minds	of	TV	writers	and	producers	.	''
The	writer	*RNR*-3	and	executive	producer	*RNR*-3	of	``	*	Settle	the	Score	,	''	Steve	Sohmer	,	is	a	graduate	of	Yale	who	*T*-1	participated	in	a	PBS	documentary	,	aired	*	this	summer	,	in	which	six	members	of	the	Yale	class	of	1963	ruminated	about	their	lives	since	graduation	*T*-2	.
At	one	point	in	the	documentary	,	Mr.	Sohmer	,	who	*T*-1	is	Jewish	,	says	0	he	felt	rejected	*-3	by	many	of	the	Protestants	and	Southerners	0	he	met	*T*-2	at	Yale	.
He	quotes	one	student	saying	,	``	You	're	just	the	kind	of	Jewboy	0	we	Southerners	ca	n't	stand	*T*-1	.
''	Mr.	Sohmer	confesses	that	it	was	partly	in	response	to	such	attitudes	that	he	is	now	``	a	dweller	on	one	of	the	two	islands	off	the	coast	of	America	*T*-1	.	''
But	is	exile	in	Hollywood	enough	?
*	Not	to	judge	by	``	*	Settle	the	Score	,	''	in	which	Mr.	Sohmer	seems	*-1	to	be	settling	a	score	of	his	own	*T*-2	.
Of	all	the	unflattering	portraits	of	small-town	America	0	I	've	seen	*T*-1	on	TV	,	this	film	is	the	most	gratuitously	nasty	.
The	sole	sympathetic	character	is	the	prodigal	daughter	Kate	-LRB-	Jaclyn	Smith	-RRB-	,	and	she	is	tolerable	only	by	virtue	of	*-2	having	nothing	in	common	with	her	kinfolk	,	a	truly	benighted	pack	of	Southern	Protestants	whose	grim	existence	*T*-1	consists	mostly	of	*	growing	peaches	and	repressing	sex	.
I	mean	,	0	these	folks	are	so	uptight	that	they	blame	pretty	Kate	for	the	fact	that	when	she	was	a	teen-ager	*T*-1	,	someone	tied	her	hands	behind	her	back	,	thrust	her	head	into	a	gunny	sack	,	brutally	raped	and	beat	her	,	and	then	left	her	to	die	in	a	cold-storage	room	.
Her	Pa	-LRB-	Howard	Duff	-RRB-	is	the	kind	of	guy	who	,	while	*-3	saying	grace	at	the	supper	table	,	*T*-4	pauses	at	the	word	``	sin	''	and	glares	at	the	daughter	0	he	has	n't	seen	*T*-2	for	two	decades	,	because	he	knows	in	his	heart	that	she	enjoyed	what	*T*-1	happened	in	the	cold-storage	room	,	and	has	been	indulging	the	same	taste	ever	since	in	the	fleshpots	of	Chicago	.
People	like	Pa	do	exist	,	of	course	.
But	in	Mr.	Sohmer	's	Ozarks	,	he	is	but	the	tip	of	the	patriarchal	iceberg	.
Every	man	0	Kate	encounters	*T*-1	is	either	sniggeringly	puritanical	,	viciously	patronizing	,	revoltingly	lecherous	,	or	all	three	.
*	Add	the	fact	that	any	one	of	them	,	including	Pa	,	could	be	her	attacker	,	and	you	have	a	setting	that	*T*-1	does	n't	resemble	small-town	America	,	or	even	Hollywood	's	nightmare	of	small-town	America	,	so	much	as	a	paranoid	feminist	dystopia	like	Margaret	Atwood	's	``	The	Handmaid	's	Tale	,	''	0	*T*-2	itself	soon	to	be	-LRB-	you	guessed	it	-RRB-	a	Hollywood	movie	.
There	are	two	exceptions	:	Josh	-LRB-	Jeffrey	DeMunn	-RRB-	,	the	local	doctor	who	*T*-1	has	always	loved	Kate	;	and	Lincoln	-LRB-	Richard	Masur	-RRB-	,	Kate	's	simple-minded	but	affectionate	brother	.
Josh	makes	clumsy	passes	at	Kate	when	she	's	seething	with	anger	and	fear	*T*-1	,	but	we	know	from	the	outset	that	he	's	not	a	member	of	the	evil	patriarchy	.
How	could	he	be	*?*	*T*-1	?
He	's	the	director	of	the	local	Planned	Parenthood	chapter	.
As	for	Lincoln	,	if	you	ca	n't	guess	why	he	's	so	sweet	to	his	sister	when	everybody	else	hates	her	*T*-1	,	then	I	'm	not	going	*-2	to	tell	you	.
As	for	the	women	,	they	're	pathetic	.
Kate	's	Ma	-LRB-	Louise	Latham	-RRB-	is	a	moral	coward	.
Her	sister-in-law	-LRB-	Amy	Wright	-RRB-	is	a	sniveling	prude	afraid	that	Kate	will	seduce	all	the	married	men	in	town	,	including	a	particularly	loathsome	fellow	named	*	Tucker	,	whose	idea	of	fun	*T*-2	is	*-3	to	leave	his	wife	at	home	*-5	tending	to	her	bruises	and	cigarette	burns	,	while	he	bullies	Kate	into	a	dance	that	*T*-1	consists	of	*	drooling	on	her	while	*-4	trying	*-6	to	break	her	ribs	.
At	the	very	least	,	it	would	appear	that	Sis	is	a	poor	judge	of	masculine	charm	.
Yet	even	these	insulting	caricatures	are	not	as	bad	as	the	moral	hypocrisy	at	the	heart	of	``	*	Settle	the	Score	.	''
In	the	aforementioned	episode	of	``	In	the	Heat	of	the	Night	,	''	we	saw	Althea	being	attacked	*-1	,	but	we	were	n't	invited	*-2	*-3	to	enjoy	the	spectacle	.
In	Mr.	Sohmer	's	film	,	by	contrast	,	we	are	urged	*-1	*-2	to	share	the	perverse	excitement	of	the	rapist	creeping	up	on	his	victim	,	as	the	camera	ogles	Kate	in	various	stages	of	undress	and	lingers	on	the	sight	of	her	trussed-up	body	during	frequent	flashbacks	to	the	rape	.
At	this	point	,	the	truce	between	feminism	and	sensationalism	gets	mighty	uneasy	.
*	Take	the	scene	in	which	Kate	stands	*-1	naked	by	a	lighted	window	,	*-1	whispering	to	her	hidden	assailant	,	``	*	Look	all	0	you	want	*T*-2	*T*-3	.
Starting	tomorrow	,	I	'm	stalking	you	.
''	Or	the	one	in	which	she	and	Josh	are	stranded	*-1	in	the	city	*T*-3	,	and	,	after	*-2	insisting	on	separate	motel	rooms	,	she	knocks	on	his	door	*-2	to	pour	out	her	feelings	about	the	rape	--	*-2	wearing	nothing	but	a	mini-slip	and	a	push-up	bra	*T*-3	.
Surely	the	question	is	obvious	.
With	friends	like	Mr.	Sohmer	,	do	the	feminists	of	Hollywood	need	enemies	?
Crossland	Savings	Bank	's	stock	plummeted	after	management	recommended	a	suspension	of	dividend	payments	on	both	its	common	and	preferred	stock	because	Crossland	may	not	meet	the	new	government	capital	criteria	effective	Dec.	7	.
In	composite	trading	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	Friday	,	Crossland	closed	at	$	5.25	*U*	,	down	$	1.875	*U*	,	a	26	%	decline	.
A	spokesman	said	0	the	savings	bank	may	not	qualify	for	the	capital	requirements	because	,	under	the	proposed	guidelines	,	its	$	380	million	*U*	of	preferred	stock	does	n't	meet	the	``	core	capital	''	criteria	outlined	*	under	the	new	Financial	Institutions	Reform	,	Recovery	and	Enforcement	Act	of	1989	.
He	added	that	final	guidelines	to	be	published	*-1	in	early	November	will	determine	whether	the	bank	is	in	compliance	.
Crossland	said	0	it	retained	three	investment	bankers	0	*T*-1	to	assist	it	in	*	developing	and	implementing	a	financial	restructuring	plan	.
It	would	n't	identify	the	bankers	.
Additionally	,	Crossland	reported	a	third-quarter	loss	of	$	175.5	million	*U*	,	or	$	13.44	*U*	a	share	,	compared	with	net	income	of	$	27.1	million	*U*	,	or	$	1.16	*U*	a	share	,	a	year	ago	.
A	major	factor	in	the	third-quarter	loss	was	the	write-down	of	$	143.6	million	*U*	of	goodwill	.
The	spokesman	said	that	the	proposed	guidelines	caused	Crossland	to	revise	its	business	objectives	and	,	consequently	,	to	write	down	the	asset	value	of	some	previous	acquisitions	.
Crossland	recorded	an	additional	$	20	million	*U*	in	loan	loss	reserves	in	the	third	quarter	.
Net	interest	income	for	the	third	quarter	declined	to	$	35.6	million	*U*	from	$	70.1	million	*U*	a	year	ago	.
However	,	non-interest	income	rose	to	$	23.5	million	*U*	from	$	22	million	*U*	.
Third-quarter	loan	originations	dropped	sharply	to	$	663	million	*U*	from	$	1	billion	*U*	a	year	ago	.
Standard	&	Poor	's	Corp.	lowered	the	rating	on	Crossland	's	preferred	stock	to	double-C	from	single-B-minus	and	placed	it	on	CreditWatch	for	possible	further	downgrade	.
It	also	placed	on	CreditWatch	for	possible	downgrade	other	securities	,	including	the	double-B-minus\/B	rating	of	Crossland	's	certificates	of	deposit	and	the	single-B	rating	of	its	senior	subordinated	capital	notes	.
About	$	518	million	*U*	of	debt	is	affected	*-1	.
The	envelope	arrives	in	the	mail	.
*	Open	it	and	two	soulful	eyes	on	a	boy	's	brown	face	peer	out	from	the	page	,	pleadingly	.
Does	the	tyke	have	a	good	mind	about	*	to	be	wasted	*-1	?
Is	he	a	victim	of	Gramm-Rudman	cuts	?
No	,	but	he	's	endangered	all	the	same	:	His	new	sitcom	on	ABC	needs	a	following	*-1	to	stay	on	the	air	.
ABC	has	n't	had	much	luck	with	shows	featuring	blacks	in	recent	years	,	and	the	producers	of	one	new	arrival	are	a	bit	desperate	.
``	Homeroom	,	''	a	show	about	a	black	ad	executive	who	*T*-1	gives	up	the	boardroom	for	a	fourth-grade	classroom	,	is	flunking	the	ratings	test	.
So	producers	Alyce	and	Topper	Carew	spun	their	Rolodexes	and	gathered	names	of	black	opinion	makers	*-1	to	mount	a	direct-mail	campaign	.
By	*-1	wooing	a	core	black	audience	they	figure	0	they	might	keep	the	show	alive	at	least	until	the	spring	semester	.
*	Using	direct	mail	for	a	TV	show	is	like	*	fishing	for	whale	with	a	breaded	hook	.
It	just	is	n't	done	*-1	.
But	*	employing	this	kind	of	gut-wrenching	plea	to	black	consciousness	makes	it	even	more	unusual	.
Still	,	Mr.	Carew	thinks	0	he	can	reach	a	good	chunk	of	the	three	million-plus	black	homes	0	he	needs	*T*-3	by	*-4	mailing	to	the	almost	10,000	blacks	who	*T*-1	form	what	he	calls	*T*-2	``	the	grapevine	.	''
``	The	grapevine	is	n't	organized	,	but	you	and	I	know	0	it	exists	,	''	says	*T*-1	Mr.	Carew	,	*-2	referring	to	the	often	uncannily	small	world	of	black	professionals	and	community	leaders	.
``	This	is	a	very	personal	,	ethnic	style	,	''	Mr.	Carew	says	*T*-1	.	``
I	want	people	in	the	barber	shops	and	the	beauty	shops	and	standing	in	line	at	the	rib	joints	to	be	talking	about	the	show	.
I	want	white	America	to	talk	about	it	,	too	,	but	I	'm	convinced	that	the	grapevine	is	what	*T*-1	's	happening	.	''
ABC	says	0	it	is	aware	of	the	producers	'	action	,	but	the	mailing	was	sent	*-1	without	the	network	's	blessing	.
The	letter	,	in	fact	,	takes	a	jab	at	ABC	for	*	being	a	laggard	in	black	programming	.
Meanwhile	,	as	the	Sunday	evening	show	struggles	*-2	to	stay	afloat	against	the	tough	competition	of	``	Murder	,	She	Wrote	*-3	,	''	the	grapevine	idea	is	threatening	*-1	to	turn	into	a	weed	:	The	tactic	apparently	has	inspired	sample	viewings	,	but	accolades	are	slow	in	*	coming	.
Doug	Alligood	,	a	black	advertising	executive	who	*T*-1	tracks	black	viewing	patterns	,	gives	the	Carews	an	``	A	''	for	marketing	moxie	,	but	is	n't	alone	in	his	lukewarm	reaction	.
Some	shows	just	do	n't	impress	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	,	and	this	is	one	of	them	.
TransCanada	PipeLines	Ltd.	said	0	it	plans	*-1	to	shift	its	headquarters	to	Calgary	,	Alberta	,	from	Toronto	next	year	*-2	to	cut	costs	and	be	closer	to	the	upstream	natural-gas	industry	.
Gerald	Maier	,	president	*RNR*-1	and	chief	executive	officer	*RNR*-1	of	the	natural-gas	pipeline	and	marketing	concern	,	said	0	the	company	's	future	growth	is	``	increasingly	linked	''	to	decisions	made	*	by	Calgary-based	gas	producers	.
``	Since	deregulation	of	the	market	in	1985	,	producers	have	become	much	more	intensely	involved	in	both	transportation	and	marketing	,	''	Mr.	Maier	said	*T*-1	.	``
It	's	a	matter	of	*	being	close	to	those	suppliers	;	many	of	those	companies	do	n't	know	us	as	well	as	they	should	*?*	.	''
TransCanada	transports	all	gas	that	*T*-1	moves	eastward	from	Alberta	.
That	includes	all	the	gas	consumed	*	in	Ontario	and	Quebec	,	along	with	the	bulk	of	Canadian	gas	exports	to	the
Walter	Litvinchuk	,	vice	president	of	Pan-Alberta	Gas	Ltd.	,	a	Calgary-based	gas	marketing	concern	,	said	0	the	industry	will	welcome	the	move	.
``	*	Having	more	than	a	token	presence	here	should	enhance	communications	and	business	relationships	,	''	Mr.	Litvinchuk	said	*T*-1	.	``
Since	the	cost	of	*	transporting	gas	is	so	important	to	producers	'	ability	*	to	sell	it	,	it	*EXP*-1	helps	*	to	have	input	and	access	to	transportation	companies	.	''
The	move	,	which	*T*-1	could	cost	TransCanada	as	much	as	50	million	Canadian	dollars	-LRB-	US$	42.5	million	*U*	-RRB-	in	relocation	and	severance	payments	,	should	be	complete	by	next	summer	,	Mr.	Maier	said	*T*-2	.
All	700	Toronto-based	employees	will	be	offered	*-1	positions	in	Calgary	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-2	.
The	company	will	save	between	C$	4	million	and	C$	6	million	*U*	annually	in	office	expenses	and	other	administrative	costs	by	*-2	moving	to	Calgary	,	Mr.	Maier	added	0	*T*-1	.
Part	of	both	the	costs	and	the	savings	could	be	passed	*-1	on	to	shippers	on	the	TransCanada	pipeline	through	tolls	,	which	*T*-3	are	based	*-2	on	the	value	of	the	pipeline	system	and	the	cost	of	*	operating	it	.
TransCanada	is	49.1	%	owned	*-1	by	Montreal-based	holding	company	BCE	Inc	.
Since	its	founding	in	1818	,	Brooks	Brothers	,	the	standard-bearer	of	the	Ivy	League	look	,	has	eschewed	flashy	sales	promotions	and	fashion	trends	--	the	rules	that	most	retailers	live	by	*T*-1	.
But	with	sales	growth	sluggish	and	other	men	's	stores	putting	on	the	heat	,	the	venerable	retailer	can	no	longer	afford	such	a	smug	attitude	.
So	two	weeks	ago	,	thousands	of	Brooks	Brothers	charge	customers	--	customers	conditioned	*	*-1	to	wait	for	twice-yearly	clearance	sales	--	got	a	surprise	:	an	invitation	*	to	come	in	and	buy	any	one	item	for	25	%	off	.
During	the	four-day	promotion	,	shoppers	at	the	Short	Hills	,	N.J.	,	store	lined	up	*-1	to	pay	for	big-ticket	items	like	coats	and	suits	.
That	's	not	all	.
*-2	Departing	from	its	newspaper	ads	featuring	prim	sketches	of	a	suit	or	a	coat	,	Brooks	Brothers	is	marketing	an	updated	image	in	a	new	campaign	that	*T*-1	carries	the	slogan	,	``	The	Surprise	of	Brooks	Brothers	.	''
One	color	photo	displays	a	rainbow	of	dress	shirts	tied	*	in	a	knot	;	another	picture	shows	neckties	with	bold	designs	.
The	message	is	loud	and	clear	:	This	is	not	your	father	's	Brooks	Brothers	.
As	part	of	its	national	ad	pitch	,	Brooks	Brothers	will	show	less	preppy	women	's	clothes	,	*-1	moving	away	from	its	floppy-tie	business	stereotype	.
One	ad	shows	a	bright	red	jacket	paired	*	with	a	black	leather	skirt	.
And	the	ad	copy	is	cheeky	:	``	How	can	you	be	a	Wall	Street	hot	shot	*T*-1	without	at	least	one	Brooks	Brothers	suit	in	your	portfolio	?	''
Brooks	Brothers	hopes	that	*	shaking	its	time-honored	traditions	will	attract	more	young	men	and	more	women	and	change	consumer	perceptions	about	its	range	of	merchandise	.
``	We	have	men	who	*T*-1	only	buy	their	shirts	and	underwear	here	or	younger	customers	who	*T*-2	only	buy	their	-LCB-	job	-RCB-	interview	suit	here	,	''	says	*T*-3	William	Roberti	,	chairman	*RNR*-4	and	chief	executive	officer	*RNR*-4	of	Brooks	Brothers	.	``
We	want	them	to	buy	more	of	their	wardrobe	here	.	''
Industry	watchers	agree	that	Brooks	Brothers	is	long	overdue	in	*-2	updating	its	buttoned-down	image	,	which	*T*-1	has	stunted	its	growth	.
When	*	acquired	*-1	in	May	1988	by	British	retailer	Marks	&	Spencer	PLC	*T*-2	,	Brooks	Brothers	'	annual	operating	profit	was	about	$	41.8	million	*U*	on	sales	of	$	290.1	million	*U*	.
Mr.	Roberti	concedes	that	since	the	$	750	million	*U*	takeover	,	``	sales	growth	has	n't	been	dramatic	.	''
For	the	11	months	ended	March	31	,	operating	profit	at	the	52-store	chain	totaled	$	40.5	million	*U*	on	sales	of	$	286.8	million	*U*	.
As	Brooks	Brothers	jumps	into	the	fashion	fray	,	it	will	be	playing	catch	up	.
Many	clothiers	,	especially	Ralph	Lauren	,	have	cashed	in	on	the	recent	popularity	of	updated	Ivy	League	and	English	styles	.
In	keeping	with	men	's	broader	fashion	scope	today	,	businessmen	are	dabbling	in	English	and	Italian	suits	that	*T*-1	are	conservative	but	not	stodgy	.
The	rigid	Ivy	League	customer	,	Brooks	Brothers	'	bread	and	butter	,	meanwhile	is	becoming	extinct	.
Thus	,	Brooks	Brothers	has	lost	customers	to	stores	that	*T*-1	offer	more	variety	such	as	Paul	Stuart	,	Barneys	New	York	and	Louis	,	Boston	.
``	Brooks	Brothers	no	longer	has	a	lock	on	the	-LCB-	Ivy	League	-RCB-	customer	who	*T*-1	is	status-conscious	about	his	clothes	,	''	says	*T*-2	Charlie	Davidson	,	president	of	the	Andover	Shop	,	a	traditional	men	's	store	in	Cambridge	,	Mass	.
By	*-1	making	a	break	from	tradition	,	Brooks	Brothers	is	seeking	a	delicate	balance	.
If	it	promotes	fashion	too	much	,	the	shop	risks	*-1	alienating	its	old-line	customers	;	by	*-2	emphasizing	``	value	,	''	it	risks	*-2	watering	down	its	high-minded	mystique	.
Fashion	industry	consultants	also	question	whether	the	company	can	make	significant	strides	in	its	women	's	business	,	given	that	its	customer	base	is	less	established	and	that	conservative	business	dress	for	women	is	on	the	decline	.
Brooks	Brothers	'	aim	is	for	20	%	of	total	sales	to	come	from	the	women	's	department	,	up	from	the	current	12	%	.
``	Everybody	forgets	that	there	are	fashion	cycles	in	classic	merchandise	,	''	observes	*T*-1	Carol	Farmer	,	a	retail	consultant	.
``	For	women	,	*-1	dressing	for	success	in	a	real	structured	way	is	over	.	''
Despite	these	challenges	,	Marks	&	Spencer	sees	big	potential	in	Brooks	Brothers	,	*-1	noting	the	widely	recognized	name	and	global	presence	.
Marks	&	Spencer	plans	*-1	to	open	roughly	18	more	U.S.	stores	in	the	next	five	years	.
Brooks	Brothers	says	0	business	is	robust	at	its	30	outlets	in	Japan	and	two	shops	in	Hong	Kong	.
Marks	&	Spencer	is	also	considering	*-1	opening	stores	across	Europe	sometime	in	the	future	.
Alan	Smith	,	president	of	Marks	&	Spencer	North	America	and	Far	East	,	says	that	Brooks	Brothers	'	focus	is	*	to	boost	sales	by	*	broadening	its	merchandise	assortment	while	*-1	keeping	its	``	traditional	emphasis	.	''
The	British	parent	is	also	streamlining	:	Brooks	Brothers	,	which	*T*-1	continues	*-2	to	make	almost	all	of	its	merchandise	,	recently	shut	one	of	its	two	shirt	plants	in	Paterson	,	N.J.	,	and	has	closed	boys	'	departments	in	all	but	20	stores	.
Brooks	Brothers	is	also	remodeling	its	stores	.
Wednesday	,	it	will	unveil	a	$	7	million	*U*	refurbishing	at	its	flagship	store	on	Madison	Avenue	.
With	newly	installed	escalators	,	the	store	retains	its	signature	wood-and-brass	look	but	is	less	intimidating	.
More	shirts	and	sweaters	will	be	laid	*-1	out	on	tables	,	instead	of	*	sitting	behind	glass	cases	,	so	that	customers	can	``	walk	up	and	touch	them	,	''	Mr.	Roberti	says	0	*T*-2	.
Because	the	biggest	growth	in	menswear	is	in	casual	sportswear	,	Brooks	Brothers	is	chasing	more	of	that	business	.
The	entire	second	floor	of	its	Madison	Avenue	store	is	now	casual	sportswear	featuring	items	such	as	ski	sweaters	,	leather	backpacks	and	a	$	42	*U*	wool	baseball	hat	with	the	store	's	crest	.
The	centerpiece	of	the	overhaul	,	according	to	Mr.	Roberti	,	is	the	men	's	tailored	clothing	department	,	where	Brooks	Brothers	has	added	new	suit	styles	and	fabrics	*T*-1	.
``	The	perception	out	there	is	that	we	are	very	conservative	and	we	only	sell	one	type	of	suit	,	''	Mr.	Roberti	says	*T*-2	,	*-1	referring	to	Brooks	Brothers	'	signature	three-button	``	sack	suit	,	''	with	a	center-vented	jacket	and	boxy	fit	.
But	it	now	offers	more	two-button	versions	and	suits	with	a	tapered	fit	.
It	also	plans	*-1	to	add	suits	cut	*	for	athletic	men	with	broader	upper	bodies	.
Next	spring	,	nearly	30	%	of	its	suits	will	have	pleated	pants	,	compared	with	virtually	none	a	couple	of	years	ago	.
Says	*ICH*-2	Mr.	Roberti	:	``	We	want	*-1	to	turn	the	customer	on	.
Ferro	Corp.	said	0	it	will	buy	back	as	many	as	one	million	common	shares	.
The	maker	of	chemical	and	industrial	materials	did	n't	say	how	much	it	would	pay	*T*-3	or	when	it	would	make	the	transactions	*T*-2	.
Ferro	also	said	0	it	would	cancel	the	unused	portion	of	a	1987	buy-back	plan	for	administrative	reasons	.
The	plan	calls	for	the	company	to	buy	back	2,250,000	shares	,	which	*T*-3	reflects	a	3-for-2	stock	split	this	year	.
So	far	the	company	had	bought	back	1.6	million	shares	.
In	New	York	Stock	Exchange	composite	trading	Friday	,	Ferro	closed	at	$	25.25	*U*	,	down	50	cents	.
Arthur	Price	abruptly	quit	as	president	*RNR*-2	and	chief	executive	officer	*RNR*-2	of	MTM	Entertainment	Inc.	,	a	Los	Angeles	production	company	that	*T*-1	has	fallen	on	hard	times	.
Mr.	Price	,	61	years	old	,	also	stepped	down	from	the	board	of	TVS	Entertainment	PLC	,	the	British	TV	company	that	*T*-1	last	year	bought	MTM	,	producer	of	such	TV	programs	as	``	Hill	Street	Blues	''	and	``	The	Mary	Tyler	Moore	Show	.	''
A	TVS	spokesman	said	0	he	did	n't	know	Mr.	Price	's	plans	.
James	Gatward	,	TVS	's	chief	executive	,	said	in	a	statement	that	he	will	``	assume	overall	responsibility	''	for	MTM	's	operations	until	a	successor	is	named	*-1	.
Industry	analysts	speculated	that	Mr.	Price	's	sudden	departure	may	have	stemmed	from	conflicts	with	Mr.	Gatward	.
Mr.	Price	``	wanted	*-1	to	run	the	MTM	business	''	and	may	have	regretted	*-1	selling	the	company	to	TVS	,	suggested	0	*T*-2	Charles	Denton	,	managing	director	of	Zenith	Productions	,	a	subsidiary	of	Carlton	Communications	PLC	,	London	.
Mr.	Gatward	declined	*-2	to	comment	,	and	Mr.	Price	could	n't	be	reached	*-1	on	Friday	.
In	the	TVS	statement	,	Mr.	Price	said	0	``	*	leaving	MTM	was	a	very	difficult	decision	,	''	but	added	that	``	it	is	now	time	for	a	change	...	.	''
The	$	320	million	*U*	purchase	of	MTM	represented	an	audacious	international	move	for	TVS	,	which	*T*-1	then	was	about	half	the	U.S.	concern	's	size	.
At	the	time	,	Mr.	Gatward	said	0	his	friendship	with	Mr.	Price	had	smoothed	the	way	for	its	link	with	the	small	British	company	.
But	TVS	stunned	industry	analysts	last	month	by	*-1	disclosing	that	it	expected	MTM	to	post	an	operating	loss	for	this	year	.
In	that	announcement	,	TVS	also	said	0	it	was	trimming	production	finance	and	hiring	a	new	U.S.	sales	manager	.
Mr.	Gatward	has	spent	a	lot	of	time	since	late	September	at	MTM	's	headquarters	;	he	eliminated	three	departments	and	fired	six	executives	,	according	to	the	TVS	spokesman	.
Further	staff	cuts	are	likely	,	the	spokesman	indicated	0	*T*-1	.
``	Obviously	,	we	are	looking	at	*	making	economies	across	the	board	.	''
TVS	blames	difficulties	in	*	peddling	reruns	of	MTM	shows	to	U.S.	broadcasters	for	the	problems	at	MTM	.
The	market	for	reruns	sold	*	to	local	U.S.	broadcasters	has	been	weak	for	the	past	three	or	four	seasons	.
Mr.	Price	co-founded	MTM	in	1969	with	U.S.	actress	Mary	Tyler	Moore	and	Grant	Tinker	,	her	then-husband	.
Mr.	Tinker	later	left	*-1	to	become	chairman	of	National	Broadcasting	Co	.
The	TVS	spokesman	said	0	Mr.	Price	still	holds	about	an	8	%	TVS	stake	,	acquired	*	as	part	of	the	MTM	acquisition	.
In	late	trading	on	London	's	Stock	Exchange	Friday	,	TVS	shares	rose	four	pence	to	195	pence	a	share	.
Two	rival	bidders	for	Connaught	BioSciences	extended	their	offers	*	to	acquire	the	Toronto-based	vaccine	manufacturer	Friday	.
Institut	Merieux	S.A.	,	which	*T*-1	offered	942	million	Canadian	dollars	-LRB-	US$	801.2	million	*U*	-RRB-	,	or	C$	37	*U*	a	share	for	Connaught	,	said	0	it	would	extend	its	bid	,	due	*	to	expire	last	Thursday	,	to	Nov.	6	.
A	C$	30-a-share	*U*	bid	by	Ciba-Geigy	Ltd.	,	a	pharmaceutical	company	based	*	in	Basel	,	Switzerland	,	and	California-based	Chiron	Corp.	,	a	bioresearch	concern	,	was	extended	*-1	to	Nov.	16	.
It	had	been	due	*	to	expire	Friday	evening	.
Merieux	previously	said	0	it	would	ensure	0	its	bid	remained	open	pending	a	final	decision	by	Canadian	regulators	on	whether	*	to	approve	the	takeover	.
Merieux	,	a	vaccine	and	bioresearch	firm	based	*	in	Lyon	,	France	,	is	controlled	*-1	50.1	%	by	state-owned	Rhone	Poulenc	S.A	.
The	Canadian	government	previously	said	0	Merieux	's	bid	did	n't	offer	enough	``	net	benefit	''	to	Canada	*-2	to	be	approved	*-1	,	and	gave	Merieux	an	until	mid-November	*-3	to	submit	additional	information	.
Merieux	officials	said	last	week	that	they	are	``	highly	confident	''	0	the	offer	will	be	approved	*-1	once	it	submits	details	of	its	proposed	investments	to	federal	regulators	.
Both	offers	are	conditional	on	regulatory	approvals	and	enough	shares	being	tendered	*	to	give	the	bidders	a	majority	of	Connaught	's	shares	outstanding	.
Institut	Merieux	,	which	*T*-1	already	holds	a	12.5	%	stake	in	Connaught	,	said	that	at	the	close	of	business	Thursday	,	5,745,188	shares	of	Connaught	and	C$	44.3	million	*U*	face	amount	of	debentures	,	convertible	into	1,826,596	common	shares	,	had	been	tendered	*-2	to	its	offer	.
At	the	close	of	business	Thursday	,	Ciba-Geigy	and	Chiron	said	0	11,580	common	shares	had	been	tendered	*-1	to	their	offer	.
At	last	report	,	Connaught	had	21.8	million	shares	outstanding	.
Separately	,	the	Ontario	Supreme	Court	said	0	it	will	postpone	indefinitely	a	ruling	on	the	lawsuit	launched	*	by	the	University	of	Toronto	against	Connaught	in	connection	with	the	Merieux	bid	.
In	a	statement	prepared	*	by	lawyers	for	the	university	and	Connaught	,	the	parties	said	0	they	agreed	that	as	a	result	of	*	reaching	a	C	415	million	*U*	research	accord	,	``	It	*EXP*-1	is	unnecessary	that	there	be	a	judgment	on	the	merits	-LCB-	of	the	case	-RCB-	at	this	time	.	''
Lawyers	for	the	two	sides	were	n't	immediately	available	for	comment	.
The	university	had	sought	an	injunction	blocking	Connaught	's	board	from	*-1	recommending	or	supporting	an	offer	for	the	company	by	Merieux	.
Conseco	Inc.	said	0	it	is	calling	for	the	redemption	on	Dec.	7	of	all	the	800,000	remaining	shares	outstanding	of	its	$	1.875	*U*	Series	A	convertible	preferred	stock	at	$	26.805	*U*	a	share	.
The	insurance	concern	said	0	all	conversion	rights	on	the	stock	will	terminate	on	Nov.	30	.
Until	then	,	Conseco	said	0	the	stock	remains	convertible	into	common	stock	at	the	rate	of	1.439	shares	of	common	stock	for	each	share	of	preferred	stock	,	which	*T*-1	is	equivalent	to	a	conversion	price	of	$	17.50	*U*	a	common	share	.
In	New	York	Stock	Exchange	trading	Friday	,	Conseco	closed	at	$	19.50	*U*	,	down	25	cents	.
Centerior	Energy	Corp.	said	0	the	Ohio	Water	Development	Authority	approved	terms	for	two	series	of	tax-exempt	bonds	0	*T*-1	to	finance	a	water-pollution	control	and	solid-waste	disposal	facilities	.
The	authority	will	issue	a	total	of	$	446.5	million	*U*	of	pollution-control	revenue	bonds	.

After	days	of	intense	but	fruitless	negotiations	,	a	federal	judge	last	week	threatened	*-1	to	convert	William	Herbert	Hunt	's	Chapter	11	personal	bankruptcy	case	into	a	Chapter	7	liquidation	.
Judge	Harold	C.	Abramson	raised	the	possibility	after	talks	0	*T*-1	to	end	a	feud	between	two	major	creditors	failed	and	all	three	reorganization	plans	in	the	case	ran	into	roadblocks	.
If	the	case	is	converted	*-1	to	Chapter	7	,	what	*T*-3	remains	of	the	oil	tycoon	's	once-vast	estate	--	*-5	now	believed	*-4	to	have	a	value	of	less	than	$	125	million	*U*	--	would	be	sold	off	quickly	with	most	of	the	proceeds	going	to	the	Internal	Revenue	Service	,	whose	claim	for	$	300	million	*U*	in	back	taxes	*T*-2	has	priority	in	the	case	.
Hundreds	of	smaller	creditors	could	get	nothing	,	according	to	attorneys	involved	*	.
While	*-2	admitting	0	such	a	move	would	be	``	devastating	''	to	most	creditors	,	Judge	Abramson	told	a	courtroom	filled	*	with	nearly	two	dozen	attorneys	that	he	was	concerned	*-1	about	the	toll	0	mounting	legal	bills	will	take	*T*-3	on	Mr.	Hunt	's	shrinking	estate	and	about	the	fact	that	,	following	voting	by	creditors	,	none	of	the	reorganization	plans	appeared	*-4	to	be	viable	in	their	present	form	.
``	It	*EXP*-1	would	be	a	shame	*	to	have	a	Chapter	7	after	all	the	progress	in	this	case	,	''	said	*T*-2	Judge	Abramson	.
Under	Chapter	11	of	the	Federal	Bankruptcy	Code	,	a	company	continues	*-1	to	operate	under	protection	from	creditors	'	lawsuits	while	it	works	out	a	plan	0	*	to	pay	its	debts	*T*-2	.
Under	Chapter	7	,	the	assets	of	a	company	are	sold	off	*-1	*	to	pay	creditors	.
Despite	his	reluctance	*	to	take	the	latter	step	,	the	judge	indicated	0	he	would	move	quickly	after	*-1	hearing	testimony	later	this	week	in	the	bitter	dispute	between	Manufacturers	Hanover	Trust	Co.	and	Minpeco	S.A.	,	a	minerals	concern	owned	*	by	the	Peruvian	governmemt	.
The	Manufacturers	Hanover	Corp.	unit	,	which	*T*-1	is	seeking	repayment	of	a	$	36	million	*U*	loan	,	has	asked	the	court	*-3	to	give	its	claim	priority	over	that	of	Minpeco	,	which	*T*-2	won	a	$	132	million	*U*	judgment	against	Mr.	Hunt	,	his	brother	Nelson	Bunker	Hunt	and	other	defendants	last	year	in	a	case	stemming	from	their	alleged	attempts	*	to	corner	the	silver	market	in
While	*-1	claiming	that	penalties	,	legal	fees	and	interest	have	driven	the	value	of	its	claim	to	more	than	$	250	million	*U*	,	Minpeco	has	agreed	*-1	to	settle	for	an	allowed	claim	of	as	much	as	$	65.7	million	*U*	.
But	even	that	is	disputed	*-1	by	Manufacturers	Hanover	which	,	in	alliance	with	the	IRS	,	*T*-2	contends	that	Minpeco	has	already	collected	more	than	its	actual	damages	from	other	defendants	in	the	silver-conspiracy	case	.
Under	prodding	from	Judge	Abramson	,	a	Minpeco	executive	flew	in	from	Peru	last	week	*-1	to	talk	directly	with	executives	from	Manufacturers	Hanover	on	a	settlement	.
Despite	long	private	sessions	in	both	New	York	and	Dallas	,	the	two	sides	ended	the	week	``	6,000	miles	and	many	dollars	apart	,	''	according	to	attorney	Hugh	Ray	,	who	*T*-1	represents	Manufacturers	Hanover	.
Meanwhile	,	inside	the	courtroom	,	the	judge	said	0	he	would	fine	attorneys	for	the	two	creditors	$	50	*U*	every	time	0	they	referred	to	each	other	with	terms	such	as	``	liar	''	or	``	slime	*T*-1	.	''
All	three	major	creditors	--	the	IRS	,	Minpeco	and	Manufacturers	Hanover	--	voted	against	*RNR*-1	and	effectively	doomed	*RNR*-1	a	reorganization	plan	proposed	*	by	Mr.	Hunt	.
A	reorganization	plan	proposed	*	jointly	by	the	IRS	and	Manufacturers	Hanover	was	stalled	*-1	by	a	negative	vote	from	Minpeco	.
The	mineral	concern	's	own	reorganization	plan	met	a	similar	fate	after	opposition	from	the	IRS	and	Manufacturers	Hanover	.
Neither	plan	is	dead	,	however	,	and	the	judge	could	force	creditors	to	accept	some	version	of	them	after	*-1	ruling	on	the	Minpeco-Manufacturers	Hanover	dispute	.
Meanwhile	,	settlement	negotiations	continue	between	Mr.	Hunt	and	the	IRS	,	which	*T*-1	has	already	reached	a	tentative	agreement	with	Nelson	Bunker	Hunt	.
The	two	sides	have	been	far	apart	on	how	much	Herbert	Hunt	will	continue	*-2	to	owe	the	government	*T*-3	after	his	assets	are	sold	*-1	.

The	world	had	a	big	yuk	recently	when	the	Soviets	reported	a	rash	of	UFO	landings	,	one	of	them	bringing	tall	aliens	who	*T*-1	glowed	in	the	dark	to	Voronezh	*T*-2	.
It	*EXP*-1	is	the	opinion	of	Timothy	Good	,	author	of	``	Above	Top	Secret	:	The	World	UFO	Cover-Up	''	-LRB-	Quill\/William	Morrow	,	592	pages	,	$	12.95	*U*	-RRB-	,	that	the	world	laughs	too	fast	.
Here	is	*T*-2	a	bible	for	UFO	watchers	,	complete	with	pictures	of	people	who	*T*-1	say	0	they	've	had	personal	relationships	with	aliens	.
One	photo	shows	a	woman	sporting	a	scar	0	she	says	0	*T*-2	was	made	*-1	by	a	laser	beam	-LRB-	a	low-caliber	weapon	,	from	the	looks	of	the	wound	-RRB-	.
So	far	anyway	,	our	alien	visitors	seem	more	intent	on	*-1	brightening	our	skies	than	*-1	pulverizing	us	.
Mr.	Good	devotes	much	serious	space	to	the	events	of	Feb.	25	,	1942	,	when	American	gunners	spotted	strange	lights	in	the	sky	above	Los	Angeles	*T*-1	.
Air-raid	sirens	sounded	the	alarm	at	2:25	a.m.	,	*-1	summoning	12,000	air	wardens	to	duty	.
Soon	all	hell	broke	loose	.
Ground	batteries	,	targeting	an	odd	assortment	of	aircraft	traveling	at	highly	unusual	speeds	,	opened	up	a	furious	fusillade	.
The	sky	filled	with	12.8-pound	shells	,	several	of	which	*T*-1	fell	back	to	Earth	,	*-2	destroying	homes	and	buildings	.
When	the	smoke	cleared	*T*-1	,	six	people	were	dead	-LRB-	three	from	heart	attacks	-RRB-	,	and	everyone	wondered	what	in	the	world	they	were	shooting	at	*T*-2	.
Mr.	Good	,	who	*T*-1	documents	these	things	as	best	he	can	*?*	,	provides	an	official	explanation	in	the	form	of	a	memorandum	from	Chief	of	Staff	George	C.	Marshall	to	President	Roosevelt	:	``	1,430	pounds	of	ammunition	,	''	he	wrote	his	commander	in	chief	0	*T*-2	,	were	expended	*-3	on	``	unidentified	aircraft	,	''	flying	at	speeds	as	slow	as	200	mph	and	elevations	between	9,000	and	18,000	feet	.
Well	,	thousands	of	Californians	on	the	scene	insisted	0	the	ammo	had	been	uselessly	aimed	at	a	large	,	hardy	UFO	,	but	you	will	just	have	*-1	to	make	your	own	decision	about	such	sightings	.
One	thing	's	for	sure	:	There	have	been	a	ton	of	them	,	and	greater	beings	than	the	editors	of	the	National	Enquirer	have	shown	interest	.
Gerald	Ford	,	a	fairly	down-to-earth	fellow	,	once	sent	a	letter	to	the	chairman	of	the	Armed	Services	Committee	*-1	recommending	that	``	there	be	a	committee	investigation	of	the	UFO	phenomenon	.
I	think	0	we	owe	it	*EXP*-1	to	the	American	people	*-2	to	establish	credibility	regarding	UFOs	and	to	produce	the	greatest	possible	enlightenment	on	the	subject	.	''
Jimmy	Carter	went	further	in	a	1976	campaign	promise	:	``	If	I	become	president	,	I	'll	make	every	piece	of	information	*ICH*-2	0	this	country	has	*T*-1	about	UFO	sightings	available	to	the	public	,	and	the	scientists	.
I	am	convinced	*-1	that	UFOs	exist	because	I	have	seen	one	...	.	''
But	you	know	about	campaign	promises	.
It	still	does	n't	look	like	governments	are	coughing	up	everything	0	they	know	*T*-1	.
Still	,	despite	their	efforts	*	to	convince	the	world	that	we	are	indeed	alone	,	the	visitors	do	seem	*-3	to	keep	*-4	coming	and	,	like	the	recent	sightings	,	there	's	often	a	detail	or	two	that	*T*-1	suggests	0	they	may	actually	be	a	little	on	the	dumb	side	.
For	instance	,	witnesses	in	Voronezh	say	0	the	pinheaded	behemoths	and	their	robot	friend	,	after	*-1	strolling	around	the	city	park	,	left	behind	some	rocks	.
Now	why	,	you	have	*-1	to	ask	yourself	*T*-2	,	would	intelligent	beings	haul	a	bunch	of	rocks	around	the	universe	*T*-3	?
Or	*	land	in	Russia	so	often	.
In	a	1961	incident	,	a	Soviet	mail	plane	disappeared	off	the	radar	screen	just	after	*-1	radioing	its	position	to	ground	control	in	Sverdlovsk	.
A	search	party	soon	found	the	unscathed	aircraft	in	a	forest	clearing	much	too	small	*	to	have	allowed	a	conventional	landing	.
What	*-1	's	more	,	the	seven	mail	personnel	aboard	were	missing	.
Again	,	you	have	*-1	to	ask	the	obvious	question	:	Why	would	intelligent	beings	kidnap	seven	Soviet	mailmen	*T*-2	?
Speculation	as	to	the	nature	of	aliens	will	no	doubt	continue	until	we	wake	up	one	morning	*-1	to	find	0	they	've	taken	over	``	The	Today	Show	,	''	the	way	0	they	overwhelm	an	entire	town	in	Jack	Finney	's	``	Invasion	of	the	Body	Snatchers	''	-LRB-	Fireside\/Simon	&	Schuster	,	216	pages	,	$	8.95	*U*	-RRB-	*T*-2	.
Maybe	some	of	our	talk-show	hosts	and	anchors	have	already	been	taken	over	*-1	?
The	point	of	this	1955	novel	,	which	*T*-1	spawned	two	movies	,	is	that	the	soulless	pod	people	replicated	*	by	alien	plants	are	virtually	indistinguishable	from	human	folks	.
Another	guy	who	*T*-1	thinks	0	they	're	out	there	and	closing	fast	is	Whitley	Strieber	,	whose	new	novel	,	``	Majestic	''	-LRB-	Putnam	,	317	pages	,	$	18.95	*U*	-RRB-	,	*T*-2	takes	a	look	at	a	reported	1947	UFO	crash	near	the	Roswell	Army	Air	Field	in	a	New	Mexico	desert	.
Mr.	Strieber	knows	a	lot	about	aliens	.
He	even	had	sex	with	one	--	sort	of	,	and	not	intentionally	--	as	readers	learned	in	his	``	Communion	''	-LRB-	a	book	recently	described	*	in	the	New	York	Times	as	a	``	nonfiction	best	seller	''	-RRB-	.
The	way	0	Mr.	Strieber	tells	it	*T*-3	in	his	earnest	prose	,	the	intelligence	officer	who	*T*-2	found	the	craft	's	strange	debris	was	forced	by	the	government	*-1	to	call	the	flower-inscribed	scraps	parts	of	a	weather	balloon	.
The	apparent	crash	became	top	secret	,	and	the	alien	creatures	went	away	*-1	upset	with	the	rude	ways	of	human	beings	.
We	lost	our	chance	*	to	communicate	with	sweet-natured	visitors	``	about	four	feet	tall	-LCB-	who	-RCB-	*T*-2	looked	as	though	they	were	made	*-1	of	puffed-up	marshmallow	.	''
Mr.	Shiflett	is	an	editorial	writer	for	the	Rocky	Mountain	News	.
Trustcorp	Inc.	will	become	Society	Bank	&	Trust	when	its	merger	*ICH*-2	is	completed	*-1	with	Society	Corp.	of	Cleveland	*T*-3	,	the	bank	said	0	*T*-4	.
Society	Corp.	,	which	*T*-1	is	also	a	bank	,	agreed	in	June	*-2	to	buy	Trustcorp	for	12.4	million	shares	of	stock	with	a	market	value	of	about	$	450	million	*U*	.
The	transaction	is	expected	*-1	to	close	around	year	end	.
When	the	economy	stumbled	in	the	mid-1970s	*T*-1	,	Akzo	NV	fell	out	of	bed	.
Towering	overcapacity	in	the	synthetic	fiber	business	,	which	*T*-1	accounted	for	half	of	the	Dutch	chemical	company	's	sales	,	led	to	huge	losses	and	left	Akzo	's	survival	in	doubt	.
It	was	n't	until	the	early	1980s	that	Akzo	nursed	itself	back	to	health	*T*-1	.
Now	,	as	a	new	downturn	in	the	chemical	industry	looms	,	Akzo	says	0	it	is	in	far	better	shape	0	*	to	cope	*T*-1	.
Investment	analysts	generally	agree	.
Aside	from	*-1	slashing	costs	and	investing	heavily	in	its	plants	,	Akzo	has	spent	3.9	billion	guilders	-LRB-	$	1.88	billion	*U*	-RRB-	on	acquisitions	since	1983	*-1	to	give	it	better	balance	.
During	the	same	period	,	the	company	has	sold	about	1.6	billion	guilders	of	assets	.
The	fibers	business	,	whose	products	*T*-1	go	into	textiles	,	carpeting	and	myriad	industrial	uses	,	now	accounts	for	only	20	%	of	Akzo	's	sales	.
``	We	have	definitely	become	less	cyclical	,	''	Syb	Bergsma	,	executive	vice	president-finance	,	said	*T*-1	in	an	interview	.
Still	,	Akzo	has	n't	yet	found	a	way	0	*	to	achieve	another	goal	:	a	large	presence	in	the	U.S.	market	for	prescription	drugs	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Bergsma	said	0	prices	for	U.S.	pharmaceutical	companies	remain	too	high	,	*	making	it	*EXP*-1	unlikely	that	Akzo	will	pursue	any	major	acquisitions	in	that	area	.
But	he	said	0	Akzo	is	considering	``	alliances	''	with	American	drug	companies	,	although	he	would	n't	elaborate	.
An	indication	of	Akzo	's	success	in	*	reshaping	itself	will	come	Thursday	when	it	reports	third-quarter	results	*T*-1	.
Analysts	expect	the	company	to	show	profit	of	about	225	million	guilders	,	up	9	%	from	206.3	million	guilders	a	year	earlier	.
A	bigger	test	will	come	next	year	if	,	as	many	analysts	expect	,	bulk	chemical	prices	slump	in	Europe	.
``	Maybe	Akzo	can	surprise	the	investment	world	a	bit	,	''	said	*T*-1	Jaap	Visker	,	an	analyst	at	Amsterdam-Rotterdam	Bank	NV	.
He	figures	0	Akzo	is	likely	*-1	to	be	one	of	the	few	major	chemical	companies	0	*T*-2	to	show	profit	growth	next	year	.
The	bank	projects	0	Akzo	will	show	per-share	earnings	of	24	guilders	in	1990	,	up	from	an	estimated	22.5	guilders	for	this	year	and	the	20.9	guilders	reported	*	for	1988	.
At	James	Capel	&	Co.	in	London	,	analyst	Jackie	Ashurst	notes	that	Akzo	is	less	exposed	*ICH*-1	than	many	of	its	rivals	to	the	most	volatile	chemical	products	.
For	example	,	Akzo	has	only	minor	petrochemical	operations	,	is	small	in	plastics	and	does	n't	make	fertilizers	.
Thus	,	while	Akzo	profited	less	than	many	rivals	from	the	boom	of	recent	years	in	petrochemicals	and	plastics	,	it	has	less	0	*	to	fear	*T*-1	from	the	current	slump	.
The	company	is	exposed	*-1	to	bulk	chemicals	,	however	.
Although	bulk-chemical	prices	have	begun	*-2	falling	in	the	U.S.	,	they	are	generally	stable	in	Europe	,	Mr.	Bergsma	said	0	*T*-1	.
A	decline	may	come	in	the	first	half	of	1990	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	,	but	the	market	does	n't	appear	on	the	verge	of	a	severe	downturn	.
*-1	To	reduce	the	danger	of	such	pricing	cycles	,	Akzo	has	invested	heavily	in	specialty	chemicals	,	which	*T*-2	have	highly	specific	industrial	uses	and	tend	*-3	to	produce	much	higher	profit	margins	than	do	*?*	bulk	chemicals	.
Akzo	's	biggest	move	in	this	area	was	the	1987	acquisition	of	Stauffer	Chemical	Co.	's	specialty	chemical	business	for	$	625	million	*U*	.
In	a	less	glamorous	field	,	Akzo	is	the	world	's	biggest	producer	of	industrial	salt	,	used	*	as	a	raw	material	for	the	chemical	industry	as	well	as	for	such	tasks	as	*	melting	ice	.
Akzo	also	makes	products	derived	*	from	salt	,	such	as	chlorine	and	caustic	soda	.
In	the	fibers	division	,	profit	remains	weak	,	largely	because	of	persistent	overcapacity	.
But	Akzo	is	still	slimming	down	:	It	recently	announced	plans	*	to	eliminate	about	1,700	fiber-related	jobs	in	the	Netherlands	and	West	Germany	.
Although	the	polyester	and	rayon	markets	remain	mostly	bleak	,	Akzo	has	high	hopes	for	some	emerging	fiber	businesses	,	such	carbon	fibers	and	aramid	,	extremely	strong	fibers	used	*	*-1	to	reinforce	tires	and	metals	and	to	make	such	products	as	bullet-proof	vests	.
Akzo	's	Twaron	aramid	fiber	is	a	distant	second	to	Du	Pont	Co.	's	Kevlar	,	which	*T*-1	dominates	the	market	.
Mr.	Bergsma	said	0	world-wide	industry	sales	of	aramid	fibers	are	expected	*-1	to	total	about	$	500	million	*U*	this	year	.
Sales	growth	of	10	%	a	year	seems	possible	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	,	and	Akzo	expects	its	Twaron	business	to	become	profitable	in	1990	.
Akzo	also	has	spent	heavily	on	acquisitions	in	paints	,	auto	finishes	and	industrial	coatings	.
In	August	,	for	example	,	it	completed	the	$	110	million	*U*	acquisition	of	Reliance	Universal	Inc.	,	a	U.S.	maker	of	industrial	coatings	for	wood	,	metals	and	plastics	,	from	Tyler	Corp	.
Mr.	Bergsma	said	0	Akzo	is	likely	*-1	to	see	strong	profit	growth	from	coatings	as	it	realizes	cost	savings	and	other	benefits	from	its	greater	scale	.
For	Akzo	's	drug	business	,	where	profits	have	shown	litle	change	for	the	past	five	years	*T*-1	,	Mr.	Bergsma	predicted	moderate	profit	growth	.
Akzo	is	the	leading	seller	of	birth-control	pills	in	Europe	but	is	still	seeking	regulatory	approvals	*	to	enter	that	market	in	the	U.S.	and	Japan	.
Mr.	Bergsma	said	0	Akzo	hopes	*-1	to	have	approval	*	to	sell	its	Marvelon	pill	in	the	U.S.	in	1992	.
Akzo	also	has	small	operations	in	diagnostic	tests	,	generic	drugs	and	veterinary	products	.
Veterinary	products	are	showing	especially	strong	growth	,	Mr.	Bergsma	said	0	*T*-1	.
Among	the	leading	products	is	*T*-1	a	flu	shot	for	horses	.
We	're	sorry	*-1	to	see	Nigel	Lawson	's	departure	from	the	British	government	.
He	is	a	politician	with	the	courage	of	true	conviction	,	as	in	*	summarily	sacking	exchange	controls	and	in	particular	slashing	the	top	rate	of	income	taxation	to	40	%	.
But	in	the	end	his	resignation	as	Chancellor	of	the	Exchequer	may	be	a	good	thing	,	especially	if	it	works	as	he	no	doubt	intends	*?*	--	by	*	forcing	Prime	Minister	Thatcher	and	her	counterparts	elsewhere	to	confront	the	genuine	intellectual	issues	involved	.
The	early	omens	,	we	admit	0	*T*-1	,	scarcely	suggest	so	wholesome	an	outcome	.
The	Fleet	Street	reaction	was	captured	*-1	in	the	Guardian	headline	,	``	Departure	Reveals	Thatcher	Poison	.	''
British	politicians	divide	into	two	groups	of	chickens	,	those	with	their	necks	cut	*-1	and	those	screaming	0	the	sky	is	falling	.
So	far	as	we	can	see	only	two	persons	*ICH*-1	are	behaving	with	a	dignity	recognizing	the	seriousness	of	the	issues	:	Mr.	Lawson	and	Sir	Alan	Walters	,	the	counterpoint	of	the	Chancellor	's	difficulties	,	who	*T*-2	also	resigned	as	personal	adviser	to	Mrs.	Thatcher	.
The	problem	is	that	on	the	vital	issue	of	monetary	policy	and	exchange	rates	,	conservative	,	free-market	economists	divide	into	at	least	three	incompatible	camps	.
There	are	the	strict	monetarists	,	who	*T*-1	believe	that	floating	exchange	rates	free	an	economy	to	stabilize	its	price	level	by	*-2	stabilizing	the	monetary	aggregates	.
There	are	the	supply-side	globalists	,	who	*T*-1	seek	*-2	to	spread	the	advantages	of	a	common	currency	through	fixed	exchange	rates	.
And	there	are	the	twin-deficit	Keynesians	,	who	*T*-1	predict\/advocate	devaluations	0	*T*-2	to	balance	trade	flows	.
This	is	a	problem	not	only	for	Prime	Minister	Thatcher	but	for	President	Bush	,	as	*-1	shown	*-2	in	the	ongoing	bickering	over	the	dollar	between	the	Federal	Reserve	and	the	Mulford	Treasury	.
In	the	British	case	,	Mr.	Lawson	is	the	closest	thing	in	London	to	a	supply-side	globalist	.
He	not	only	slashed	marginal	tax	rates	,	*-2	initially	sparking	fresh	growth	in	Britain	,	but	he	wanted	*-1	to	regulate	monetary	policy	by	*-3	targeting	exchange	rates	,	indeed	joining	the	European	Monetary	System	.
While	*-1	no	doubt	agreeing	with	Mr.	Lawson	on	everything	else	,	Sir	Alan	is	a	dyed-in-the-wool	monetarist	,	inclined	*	to	defend	floating	rates	to	the	death	.
*	To	make	matters	even	more	confusing	,	the	earlier	U.S.	experience	made	clear	that	Mr.	Lawson	's	tax	cuts	would	have	profound	effects	on	Britain	's	international	accounts	and	the	value	of	sterling	.
They	increased	the	after-tax	rate	of	return	and	made	Britain	a	far	more	attractive	place	0	*	to	invest	*T*-1	,	*-2	producing	sudden	capital	inflows	.
By	accounting	definitions	,	this	had	*-1	to	produce	a	sudden	trade	deficit	.
As	in	the	U.S.	,	it	also	produced	a	sudden	burst	in	the	demand	for	sterling	,	that	is	a	surge	in	the	sterling	monetary	aggregates	,	M-Whatever	.
At	this	point	,	the	options	were	:	*	Crunch	money	*-1	to	stop	the	boost	in	the	aggregates	,	as	Sir	Alan	surely	advised	*?*	,	and	*	forget	the	soaring	pound	.
*	To	push	the	pound	even	lower	*-1	trying	*-2	to	cure	the	trade	deficit	,	a	policy	0	Britain	has	repeatedly	proved	*T*-3	disastrous	.
Or	*	to	supply	enough	money	0	*T*-1	to	meet	the	increased	demand	and	stabilize	the	exchange	rate	,	as	the	Chancellor	argued	*?*	,	and	ensure	the	permanence	of	this	policy	by	*-2	joining	the	EMS	.
*-1	Faced	*-2	with	a	similar	situation	,	Paul	Volcker	let	the	dollar	soar	,	-LRB-	though	monetary	aggregates	also	grew	so	rapidly	0	monetarists	issued	egg-on-the-face	warnings	of	inflation	-RRB-	.
But	this	devastated	the	U.S.	manufacturing	sector	,	*-1	laying	the	seeds	of	protectionism	.
Mr.	Lawson	,	though	*-1	not	allowed	*-2	to	join	the	EMS	,	chose	*-1	to	``	shadow	''	the	deutsche	mark	.
He	reaped	inflation	along	with	rapid	growth	,	no	doubt	*-1	validating	Sir	Alan	's	predictions	in	the	Prime	Minister	's	mind	.
But	more	recently	,	the	pound	has	been	falling	with	high	inflation	,	which	*T*-1	has	also	seemed	almost	impervious	to	the	high	interest	rates	0	Mr.	Lawson	deployed	*T*-2	*-3	to	stop	it	.
So	the	British	experience	presents	a	genuine	puzzle	that	*T*-1	reaches	far	beyond	the	shores	of	Albion	.
We	had	been	soliciting	opinions	on	it	long	before	Mr.	Lawson	's	resignation	,	and	offer	some	of	the	collection	for	the	benefit	of	his	successor	and	one-time	deputy	,	John	Major	.
*-1	To	begin	with	,	we	should	note	that	in	contrast	to	the	U.S.	deficit	,	Britain	has	been	running	largish	budget	surpluses	.
In	pursuit	of	this	mystery	,	Keynesian	adepts	and	twin-deficit	mavens	need	not	apply	.
We	should	also	add	Mr.	Lawson	's	own	explanation	,	as	we	understand	it	.
Unlike	the	U.S.	,	Britain	never	achieved	even	a	momentary	reduction	in	real	wages	.
The	wage	stickiness	,	which	OECD	studies	confirm	0	*T*-1	is	particularly	high	in	Britain	,	gives	its	economy	a	structural	bias	toward	inflation	.
Inflation	is	easier	0	*	to	spark	*T*-1	and	harder	0	*	to	control	*T*-2	.
We	should	also	concede	that	in	the	British	experience	the	monetarist	cause	regains	some	of	the	credibility	0	it	lost	*T*-1	in	the	U.S.	experience	.
Nearby	Paul	Craig	Roberts	,	a	distinguished	supply-sider	with	monetarist	sympathies	,	argues	the	case	for	Sir	Alan	.
Perhaps	the	fiscal	shock	of	tax	cuts	is	after	all	best	absorbed	*-1	by	floating	rates	,	though	of	course	in	the	event	Mr.	Lawson	resigned	over	whether	*	to	support	a	weak	pound	,	not	restrain	a	strong	one	.
We	recall	that	Mr.	Roberts	not	only	chides	the	Chancellor	for	*-2	being	too	easy	because	of	a	desire	*	to	constrain	sterling	,	but	also	led	the	chorus	saying	that	Mr.	Volcker	was	too	tight	when	he	let	the	dollar	rise	*T*-1	.
Somewhere	in	between	there	must	be	a	golden	mean	,	perhaps	measured	*	by	M-Whatever	,	but	perhaps	measured	*	by	purchasing	power	parity	.
The	globalists	tend	*-1	to	think	0	Mr.	Lawson	ran	onto	technical	reefs	.
In	*	fixing	rates	the	choice	of	initial	parities	is	crucial	,	for	example	,	and	perhaps	he	picked	the	wrong	pound-DM	rate	.
For	that	matter	,	perhaps	he	fixed	to	the	wrong	currency	.
We	sympathize	with	Mrs.	Thatcher	's	reluctance	*	to	tie	her	currency	to	one	governed	*	by	the	domestic	political	imperatives	of	West	Germany	.
Perhaps	the	shock	would	have	been	less	if	they	'd	fixed	to	another	low-tax	,	deregulated	,	supply-side	economy	.
Alan	Reynolds	of	Polyconomics	adds	his	suspicion	that	the	unrecognized	inflationary	culprit	is	the	budget	surplus	.
Those	who	*T*-1	can	shake	Keynesian	ghosts	out	of	their	heads	might	recognize	that	the	retirement	of	gilts	for	cash	is	equivalent	to	an	expansionary	open-market	operation	,	indeed	,	it	*EXP*-2	is	the	definition	of	an	open	market	operation	*	to	expand	the	money	supply	.
Mr.	Reynolds	also	notes	that	since	British	banks	have	no	reserve	requirements	,	high	interest	rates	are	less	likely	*-1	to	curb	inflation	than	*-1	to	cause	recession	.
We	would	add	that	in	political	terms	,	Mrs.	Thatcher	's	problem	was	*	failing	*-1	to	decide	between	the	Chancellor	and	her	adviser	.
In	the	end	,	neither	policy	was	followed	*-1	,	and	instead	of	*-2	learning	anything	we	are	left	*-2	with	a	mystery	.
In	particular	,	*	``	shadowing	''	a	currency	is	anything	but	fixing	;	it	is	an	open	announcement	that	the	exchange	rate	target	has	no	credibility	.
All	the	more	so	when	strong	voices	are	heard	*-2	opposing	the	policy	*T*-1	.
Better	*	to	have	a	true	monetarist	policy	,	just	for	the	experience	.
So	Mr.	Lawson	had	*-1	to	resign	.
In	the	end	his	move	was	sparked	*-1	by	remarks	in	excerpts	from	Sir	Alan	's	autobiography	in	The	American	Economist	,	a	10,000-circulation	academic	journal	.
But	it	was	the	underlying	situation	that	*T*-1	became	intolerable	.
What	Mr.	Major	and	Mrs.	Thatcher	will	do	*T*-2	now	remains	*-3	to	be	seen	*-1	.
They	confront	stubborn	inflation	and	a	sagging	economy	,	that	is	*	to	say	,	stagflation	.
This	can	not	be	solved	*-1	by	*	provoking	a	further	downturn	;	*	reducing	the	supply	of	goods	does	not	solve	inflation	.
Our	advice	is	this	:	*	Immediately	return	the	government	surpluses	to	the	economy	through	incentive-maximizing	tax	cuts	,	and	find	some	monetary	policy	target	that	*T*-1	balances	both	supply	and	demand	for	money	-LRB-	which	neither	aggregates	nor	interest	rates	can	do	*T*-2	-RRB-	.
This	was	the	version	of	supply-side	economics	that	,	in	the	late	1970s	and	early	'80s	,	*T*-1	worked	in	America	and	world-wide	*-2	to	solve	a	far	more	serious	stagflation	than	*?*	afflicts	Britain	today	.
Ogilvy	&	Mather	,	whose	declining	profitability	*T*-1	prompted	its	takeover	by	WPP	Group	earlier	this	year	,	will	see	its	profit	margins	bounce	back	to	the	``	11.5	%	range	''	in	1990	,	said	0	*T*-2	Graham	Phillips	,	the	agency	's	new	chairman-elect	.
The	ad	agency	's	pretax	profit	margins	were	slightly	under	10	%	at	the	time	of	the	takeover	,	according	to	analysts	;	London-based	WPP	's	goal	is	*	to	increase	margins	to	12	%	.
Mr.	Phillips	made	his	comments	during	an	interview	detailing	his	plans	for	the	agency	.
*-1	British-born	,	the	24-year	Ogilvy	veteran	was	named	last	week	*-1	to	succeed	Kenneth	Roman	,	who	*T*-2	is	leaving	by	year	's	end	*-3	to	take	a	top	post	at	American	Express	,	an	Ogilvy	client	.
*-2	Surrounded	*-1	by	stacks	of	paper	,	two	computers	and	photos	of	himself	boating	and	flying	,	Mr.	Phillips	laid	out	several	changes	0	he	hopes	*-3	to	make	*T*-4	at	the	agency	.
First	and	foremost	,	Mr.	Phillips	said	0	he	hopes	*-1	to	improve	client	service	.
Ogilvy	under	the	fastidious	Mr.	Roman	gained	a	reputation	as	*-3	occasionally	being	high-handed	in	its	treatment	of	clients	,	of	*-3	preaching	what	strategy	a	client	should	*RNR*-2	--	indeed	,	must	*RNR*-2	--	follow	*T*-1	.
And	some	of	its	top	client-service	executives	,	including	Mr.	Phillips	,	were	promoted	*-1	to	the	point	0	they	were	saddled	*-2	with	administrative	duties	*T*-4	,	with	little	time	0	*	to	see	clients	*T*-3	.
But	Mr.	Phillips	recently	freed	himself	up	*-1	to	spend	more	time	with	clients	by	*-1	delegating	much	of	his	administrative	work	to	a	deputy	.
He	also	plans	*-1	to	get	*-2	to	know	clients	that	Mr.	Roman	was	closer	to	*T*-3	,	such	as	Lever	Brothers	,	American	Express	and	Seagram	.
The	two	men	are	planning	joint	visits	to	a	number	of	clients	*-1	to	attempt	*-2	to	smoothly	hand	over	the	reins	.
``	Clients	want	*-2	to	see	more	of	our	senior	people	involved	*	in	the	business	--	not	once	a	month	,	but	two	or	three	times	a	week	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Phillips	also	hopes	*-1	to	finally	implement	a	reorganization	announced	*	earlier	this	year	but	put	*	on	hold	by	the	WPP	takeover	.
The	reorganization	is	supposed	*-1	to	make	one-stop	shopping	--	*	buying	advertising	,	public	relations	and	design	all	in	one	place	,	or	``	Ogilvy	Orchestration	''	in	Ogilvyspeak	--	a	reality	.
Under	the	reorganization	,	Ogilvy	plans	*-1	to	name	one	executive	on	each	account	as	a	``	client	service	director	''	0	*T*-2	to	work	as	the	client	's	single	contact	for	all	those	services	.
``	There	is	little	or	no	integration	of	our	work	,	quality	is	spotty	,	there	is	no	single	focus	,	''	Mr.	Phillips	complained	*T*-2	to	staffers	in	March	,	when	the	reorganization	was	announced	*-1	*T*-3	.
Now	Mr.	Phillips	says	0	he	hopes	*-1	to	have	the	new	system	in	place	for	several	clients	--	including	American	Express	,	American	Telephone	&	Telegraph	and	Ryder	--	by	year	's	end	.
Industry	executives	and	analysts	are	divided	*-1	on	whether	Mr.	Phillips	is	up	to	the	task	.
He	is	n't	as	well-known	to	clients	as	is	*?*	Mr.	Roman	.
Under	his	watch	,	office	politicking	was	often	rampant	in	the	agency	's	New	York	operation	and	the	office	there	has	had	a	dismal	new-business	record	for	more	than	a	year	.
And	while	last	week	the	agency	hired	a	top	Chiat\/Day\/Mojo	executive	,	Bill	Hamilton	,	0	*T*-4	to	try	*-1	to	bolster	its	work	,	``	Graham	has	*-2	to	get	the	revenue	of	that	New	York	office	moving	,	''	says	*T*-3	James	Dougherty	,	an	analyst	with	County	NatWest	Securities	.
The	one	thing	0	Mr.	Phillips	clearly	does	have	*T*-1	going	for	him	is	continuity	,	although	it	*EXP*-2	is	n't	certain	if	that	will	be	enough	.
As	Mr.	Dougherty	says	*?*	,	``	The	last	thing	0	they	need	*T*-1	is	enormous	disruption	at	the	top	...	and	Graham	is	obviously	a	long-term	member	of	the	Ogilvy	Mafia	,	0	as	we	call	it	*T*-2	.	''
Mr.	Phillips	and	Mr.	Roman	are	indeed	quite	similar	in	substance	,	if	not	in	style	.
While	Mr.	Roman	is	a	workaholic	detailsman	,	Mr.	Phillips	would	rather	delegate	,	*	leaving	him	time	for	his	interests	outside	the	office	.
Mr.	Roman	,	by	contrast	,	seems	*-1	rarely	to	cut	loose	at	all	,	although	he	did	appear	at	Ogilvy	's	Halloween	party	Friday	*-2	decked	out	in	duck	feet	and	a	duck	hat	,	*-3	costumed	as	a	``	lame	duck	.	''
Mr.	Phillips	said	0	the	company	's	expected	margin	improvement	will	be	all	but	inevitable	,	given	that	the	company	's	profitability	was	dragged	*-1	down	this	year	by	an	expensive	move	to	luxurious	,	oversized	new	New	York	headquarters	.
The	move	,	budgeted	*	at	about	$	7	million	*U*	,	actually	came	in	at	about	$	10	million	*U*	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
But	margins	will	be	helped	*-1	,	too	,	by	some	other	cost-saving	steps	.
Ogilvy	eliminated	the	mail	room	staff	,	closed	the	executive	dining	room	and	,	after	the	takeover	,	let	go	half	a	dozen	financial	executives	.
WPP	,	which	*T*-1	assumes	financial	control	of	its	businesses	in	a	hands-on	way	,	instituted	a	new	financial	system	and	plans	*-2	to	sublet	some	floors	in	Ogilvy	's	new	headquarters	building	to	outsiders	.
The	fact	that	the	agency	will	now	be	part	of	a	U.K.	company	,	under	British	accounting	rules	,	will	also	make	the	profit	picture	look	better	.
Y&R	's	Klein	Steps	Down
Arthur	Klein	,	president	of	Young	&	Rubicam	's	New	York	office	,	stepped	down	``	temporarily	''	in	the	wake	of	charges	*ICH*-2	by	a	federal	grand	jury	in	New	Haven	,	Conn.	,	that	he	,	the	agency	and	another	top	executive	bribed	Jamaican	tourist	officials	*-1	to	win	its	account	in	1981	.
In	an	internal	memo	,	Alex	Kroll	,	the	agency	's	chairman	,	said	0	Mr.	Klein	decided	*-1	to	remove	himself	*-1	to	minimize	``	negative	reaction	''	from	prospective	clients	and	others	and	*-1	to	prepare	for	his	defense	.
``	The	fact	that	he	is	in	the	process	of	*-2	defending	himself	against	the	present	charges	could	conceivably	have	an	adverse	impact	on	Y&R	,	''	Mr.	Kroll	wrote	*T*-1	.
He	said	0	Mr.	Klein	will	return	to	his	post	at	the	end	of	the	trial	``	at	which	he	will	be	vindicated	*-1	*T*-2	.	''
Mr.	Klein	will	work	with	Mr.	Kroll	on	some	of	the	agency	's	joint	venture	activities	and	acquisitions	while	the	case	is	pending	.
Peter	Georgescu	,	president	of	Y&R	's	ad	operations	,	will	assume	Mr.	Klein	's	day-to-day	role	.
Wells	Rich	's	New	Partner
Wells	,	Rich	,	Greene	named	Cheryl	Heller	as	an	executive	vice	president	*RNR*-2	and	creative	partner	*RNR*-2	in	its	image	group	,	which	*T*-1	concentrates	on	fashion	and	visually	oriented	advertising	.
Ms.	Heller	,	38	,	had	headed	up	Boston	agency	Heller\/Breene	,	a	unit	of	WCRS	.
The	agency	,	with	about	$	35	million	*U*	in	billings	,	will	be	dissolved	*-1	,	with	some	of	its	staffers	absorbed	*	by	WCRS	's	Della	Femina	McNamee	unit	in	Boston	,	Ms.	Heller	said	0	*T*-2	.
She	said	0	it	was	too	early	*	to	say	what	*T*-1	would	happen	to	its	clients	,	including	Reebok	and	Apple	.
At	Wells	Rich	,	Ms.	Heller	will	concentrate	on	accounts	that	*T*-1	include	Philip	Morris	's	Benson	&	Hedges	cigarette	brand	,	which	*T*-2	relies	on	print	ads	,	Ms.	Heller	's	specialty	.
As	*	previously	reported	*-1	,	the	account	is	troubled	,	with	Philip	Morris	asking	Backer	Spielvogel	Bates	,	Ogilvy	&	Mather	,	and	possibly	others	to	try	their	hand	at	*-2	developing	new	creative	work	.
Wells	Rich	declined	*-1	to	comment	on	the	status	of	the	account	,	as	did	*?*	the	other	agencies	.
Waxman	Industries	Inc.	said	0	holders	of	$	6,542,000	*U*	face	amount	of	its	6	1\/4	%	convertible	subordinated	debentures	,	due	March	15	,	2007	,	have	elected	*-1	to	convert	the	debt	into	about	683,000	common	shares	.
The	conversion	price	is	$	9.58	*U*	a	share	.
The	company	said	0	the	holders	represent	52	%	of	the	face	amount	of	the	debentures	.
Waxman	sells	a	variety	of	hardware	products	for	the	home	repair	market	.
R.H.	Macy	&	Co.	,	the	closely	held	department	store	chain	,	said	in	a	financial	filing	Friday	that	its	sales	for	the	fiscal	fourth	quarter	ended	July	29	were	up	10	%	to	$	1.59	billion	*U*	against	$	1.44	billion	*U*	a	year	earlier	.
Comparable	store	sales	for	the	quarter	were	up	7.3	%	.
The	net	loss	for	the	quarter	was	$	43.1	million	*U*	against	a	year-earlier	loss	of	$	106	million	*U*	.
The	loss	in	the	fourth	quarter	of	1988	reflected	in	part	expenses	for	an	unsuccessful	bid	for	Federated	Department	Stores	Inc.	,	as	well	as	the	restructuring	of	some	of	its	department	store	operations	.
For	the	year	,	sales	were	up	5.6	%	to	$	6.97	billion	*U*	compared	with	$	6.61	billion	*U*	in	fiscal	1988	.
Sales	for	both	years	reflect	12-month	performances	for	each	year	of	I.	Magnin	,	Bullock	's	,	and	Bullocks	Wilshire	.
Macy	acquired	those	three	businesses	in	May	1988	.
On	a	comparable	store	basis	,	including	the	new	acquisitions	for	both	years	,	sales	for	fiscal	1989	were	up	1.9	%	.
Macy	reported	a	net	loss	for	fiscal	1989	of	$	53.7	million	*U*	compared	with	a	net	loss	of	$	188.2	million	*U*	for	fiscal	1988	.
The	company	's	earnings	before	interest	,	taxes	and	depreciation	,	which	bondholders	use	*T*-1	a	measurement	of	the	chain	's	ability	*	to	pay	its	existing	debt	,	increased	11	%	in	fiscal	1989	to	$	926.1	million	*U*	from	$	833.6	million	*U*	.
The	$	833.6	million	*U*	figures	includes	the	new	acquisitions	.
Excluding	those	businesses	,	earnings	before	interest	,	taxes	and	depreciation	for	1988	would	have	been	$	728.5	million	*U*	.
As	of	Feb.	1	,	1990	,	the	Bullocks	Wilshire	stores	will	operate	as	I.	Magnin	stores	.
Altogether	,	Macy	and	its	subsidiaries	own	or	lease	149	department	stores	and	61	specialty	stores	nationwide	.
Although	management	led	a	leveraged	buy-out	of	R.H.	Macy	in	July	1986	,	the	company	still	makes	financial	filings	because	of	its	publicly	traded	debt	.
The	company	estimates	its	total	debt	at	about	$	5.2	billion	*U*	.
This	includes	$	4.6	billion	*U*	of	long-term	debt	,	$	457.5	million	*U*	in	short-term	debt	,	and	$	95.7	million	*U*	of	the	current	portion	of	long-term	debt	.
In	a	letter	to	investors	,	Chairman	Edward	S.	Finkelstein	wrote	that	he	expects	the	company	to	``	benefit	from	some	of	the	disruption	faced	*	by	our	competitors	.
While	our	competitors	are	concerned	*-1	with	their	financial	viability	and	possible	ownership	changes	,	we	will	be	concentrating	on	*-3	buying	and	selling	merchandise	0	our	customers	need	and	want	*T*-2	.	''
Mr.	Finkelstein	is	apparently	referring	to	B.	Altman	and	Bonwit	Teller	,	two	New	York	retailers	that	*T*-1	have	recently	filed	for	Chapter	11	bankruptcy	protection	,	as	well	as	the	retail	chains	owned	*	by	financially	troubled	Campeau	Corp	.
Those	chains	include	Bloomingdale	's	,	which	Campeau	recently	said	0	it	will	sell	*T*-1	.
Other	retail	properties	for	sale	include	Saks	Fifth	Avenue	and	Marshall	Field	,	retailers	now	owned	*	by	B.A.T	PLC	,	the	British	tobacco	conglomerate	.
In	his	letter	,	Mr.	Finkelstein	also	referred	to	the	recent	San	Francisco	earthquake	.
Mr.	Finkelstein	flew	to	San	Francisco	the	day	after	the	earthquake	,	and	found	that	10	to	12	of	his	company	's	stores	had	sustained	some	damage	,	including	the	breakage	of	most	windows	at	the	I.	Magnin	store	on	Union	Square	.
``	The	volume	and	profit	impact	on	our	fiscal	first	quarter	will	not	be	positive	,	but	*-1	looking	at	the	whole	fiscal	year	,	we	do	n't	see	the	effect	as	material	,	''	wrote	*T*-2	Mr.	Finkelstein	.
RJR	Nabisco	Inc.	said	0	it	agreed	*-1	to	sell	its	Baby	Ruth	,	Butterfinger	and	Pearson	candy	businesses	to	Nestle	S.A.	's	Nestle	Foods	unit	for	$	370	million	*U*	.
The	sale	,	at	a	higher	price	than	some	analysts	had	expected	*?*	,	helps	the	food	and	tobacco	giant	raise	funds	0	*	to	pay	debt	*T*-2	and	boosts	Nestle	's	7	%	share	of	the	U.S.	candy	market	to	about	12	%	.
The	candy	businesses	had	sales	of	about	$	154	million	*U*	*ICH*-2	last	year	,	which	*T*-1	was	roughly	12	%	of	total	revenue	for	RJR	's	Planters	LifeSavers	unit	,	according	to	a	memorandum	distributed	*	by	RJR	's	owner	,	Kohlberg	Kravis	Roberts	&	Co.	,	to	bankers	last	December	.
The	Nestle	acquisition	includes	a	candy	plant	in	Franklin	Park	,	Ill.	,	which	*T*-1	employs	about	800	workers	.
The	sale	,	which	*T*-1	had	been	expected	*-2	,	is	part	of	KKR	's	program	0	*	to	pay	down	$	5	billion	*U*	of	a	$	6	billion	*U*	bridge	loan	by	February	*T*-3	.
Roughly	$	2	billion	*U*	of	that	debt	has	already	been	repaid	*-1	from	previous	asset	sales	,	and	RJR	expects	*-2	to	use	another	$	2	billion	*U*	from	the	pending	,	two-part	sale	of	most	of	its	Del	Monte	unit	.
That	sale	,	however	,	could	still	fall	through	if	financing	problems	develop	.
Thus	,	it	*EXP*-1	remains	crucial	for	RJR	to	obtain	top	dollar	for	its	smaller	assets	like	the	candy	brands	.
Louis	Gerstner	Jr.	,	chairman	*RNR*-1	and	chief	executive	officer	*RNR*-1	of	New	York-based	RJR	,	called	the	sale	a	``	significant	step	''	in	the	company	's	divestiture	program	,	as	well	as	a	``	a	strategic	divestiture	.	''
Since	KKR	bought	RJR	in	February	for	$	25	billion	*U*	of	debt	,	it	has	agreed	*-1	to	sell	nearly	$	5	billion	*U*	of	RJR	assets	.
RJR	's	executives	have	said	0	they	will	dispense	with	certain	brands	,	in	particular	,	that	*T*-1	are	n't	leaders	in	their	markets	.
``	RJR	Nabisco	and	Planters	LifeSavers	will	concentrate	more	on	our	own	core	businesses	,	''	Mr.	Gerstner	said	*T*-1	Friday	.
Baby	Ruth	and	Butterfinger	are	both	among	the	top-selling	15	chocolate	bars	in	the	U.S.	,	but	RJR	's	overall	share	of	the	roughly	$	5.1	billion	*U*	market	is	less	than	5	%	.
Nestle	's	share	of	7	%	before	Friday	's	purchases	is	far	below	the	shares	of	market	leaders	Hershey	Foods	Corp.	and	Mars	Inc.	,	which	*T*-2	have	about	40	%	and	36	%	*U*	of	the	market	,	respectively	.
``	This	means	0	Nestle	is	now	in	the	candybar	business	in	a	big	way	,	''	said	*T*-1	Lisbeth	Echeandia	,	publisher	of	Orlando	,	Fla.-based	Confectioner	Magazine	.
``	For	them	,	it	makes	all	kinds	of	sense	.
They	've	been	given	*-1	a	mandate	*ICH*-2	from	Switzerland	''	*	to	expand	their	U.S.	chocolate	operations	.
Nestle	S.A.	is	based	*-1	in	Vevey	,	Switzerland	.
The	new	candy	bars	,	``	make	an	important	contribution	to	our	Nestle	Foods	commitment	to	this	very	important	strategic	unit	,	''	said	0	*T*-1	C.	Alan	MacDonald	,	president	of	Nestle	Foods	in	Purchase	,	N.Y	.
Aetna	Life	&	Casualty	Co.	's	third-quarter	net	income	fell	22	%	to	$	182.6	million	*U*	,	or	$	1.63	*U*	a	share	,	*	reflecting	the	damages	from	Hurricane	Hugo	and	lower	results	for	some	of	the	company	's	major	divisions	.
Catastrophe	losses	reduced	Aetna	's	net	income	by	$	50	million	*U*	,	including	$	36	million	*U*	from	Hugo	.
Last	year	catastrophe	losses	totaled	$	5	million	*U*	,	when	net	was	$	235.5	million	*U*	,	or	$	2.07	*U*	a	share	*T*-1	.
The	year-earlier	results	have	been	restated	*-1	*-2	to	reflect	an	accounting	change	.
The	insurer	has	started	*-1	processing	claims	from	the	Northern	California	earthquake	nearly	two	weeks	ago	.
But	because	these	claims	are	more	difficult	*	to	evaluate	and	have	been	coming	in	more	slowly	,	the	company	has	no	estimate	of	the	impact	of	the	earthquake	on	fourth-quarter	results	.
In	New	York	Stock	Exchange	composite	trading	Friday	,	Aetna	closed	at	$	60	*U*	,	down	50	cents	.
In	the	latest	quarter	,	Aetna	had	a	$	23	million	*U*	loss	on	its	auto\/homeowners	line	,	compared	with	earnings	of	$	33	million	*U*	last	year	.
Profit	for	its	commercial	insurance	division	fell	30	%	to	$	59	million	*U*	,	*	reflecting	higher	catastrophe	losses	and	the	price	war	in	the	property\/casualty	market	for	nearly	three	years	.
However	,	Aetna	's	employee	benefits	division	,	which	*T*-1	includes	its	group	health	insurance	operations	,	posted	a	34	%	profit	gain	to	$	106	million	*U*	.
Third-quarter	results	included	net	realized	capital	gains	of	$	48	million	*U*	,	which	*T*-1	included	$	27	million	*U*	from	the	sale	of	Federated	Investors	in	August	and	a	$	15	million	*U*	tax	credit	.
In	the	nine	months	,	net	rose	4.3	%	to	$	525.8	million	*U*	or	$	4.67	*U*	a	share	,	from	$	504.2	million	*U*	,	or	$	4.41	*U*	a	share	,	last	year	.
Out	of	the	mouths	of	revolutionaries	are	coming	*T*-1	words	of	moderation	.
Here	,	at	a	soccer	stadium	near	the	black	township	of	Soweto	yesterday	,	were	*T*-2	eight	leaders	of	the	African	National	Congress	,	seven	of	whom	*T*-1	had	spent	most	of	their	adult	lives	in	prison	for	sabotage	and	conspiracy	*	to	overthrow	the	government	.
Here	were	*T*-2	more	than	70,000	ANC	supporters	,	gathering	for	the	first	ANC	rally	inside	South	Africa	since	the	black	liberation	movement	was	banned	*-1	in	1960	.
Here	was	*T*-1	the	state	security	appartus	poised	*	to	pounce	on	any	words	or	acts	of	provocation	,	let	alone	revolution	.
But	the	words	that	*T*-1	boomed	over	the	loudspeakers	bore	messages	of	peace	,	unity	,	negotiation	and	discipline	.
``	We	stand	for	peace	today	and	we	will	stand	for	peace	tomorrow	,	''	said	*T*-2	Walter	Sisulu	,	the	ANC	's	former	secretary	general	who	,	along	with	five	of	his	colleagues	,	*T*-3	served	26	years	in	prison	before	*-4	being	released	*-1	two	weeks	ago	.
Some	members	of	the	huge	crowd	shouted	``	Viva	peace	,	viva	.	''
These	are	curious	times	in	South	African	politics	.
The	government	and	the	ANC	,	the	bitterest	of	enemies	,	are	engaged	*-1	in	an	elaborate	mating	dance	designed	*	*-2	to	entice	each	other	to	the	negotiating	table	.
Pretoria	releases	the	ANC	leaders	,	most	of	whom	*T*-1	were	serving	life	sentences	,	and	allows	them	to	speak	freely	,	*-2	hoping	that	the	ANC	will	abandon	its	use	of	violence	.
The	ANC	leaders	speak	in	tones	of	moderation	,	*-1	emphasizing	discipline	,	*-1	hoping	0	the	government	will	be	encouraged	*-2	to	take	further	steps	,	such	as	*-3	freeing	Nelson	Mandela	,	the	most	prominent	ANC	figure	,	and	unbanning	the	organization	.
The	government	of	President	F.W.	de	Klerk	is	using	this	situation	*-1	to	improve	its	international	image	and	head	off	further	economic	sanctions	.
Meanwhile	,	the	many	organizations	inside	the	country	that	*T*-1	back	the	ANC	are	taking	the	opportunity	*	to	regain	their	strength	and	mobilize	their	supporters	even	though	the	state	of	emergency	,	which	*T*-2	has	severely	curtailed	black	opposition	,	remains	in	force	.
The	result	is	that	the	unthinkable	and	illogical	are	happening	.
Six	months	ago	,	government	approval	for	an	ANC	rally	was	inconceivable	.
Equally	inconceivable	is	*T*-1	that	the	ANC	,	given	the	chance	*	to	hold	a	rally	,	would	extend	a	hand	,	albeit	warily	,	to	the	government	.
In	a	message	read	*	out	at	the	rally	,	exiled	ANC	President	Oliver	Tambo	,	who	*T*-1	ca	n't	legally	be	quoted	*-3	in	South	Africa	,	said	0	the	country	was	at	a	crossroads	and	that	Mr.	de	Klerk	``	may	yet	earn	a	place	among	the	peacemakers	of	our	country	''	if	he	chooses	a	``	path	of	genuine	political	settlement	.	''
Still	,	this	does	n't	mean	that	either	the	government	or	the	ANC	is	changing	stripes	--	or	that	either	has	moved	significantly	closer	to	the	other	.
The	government	may	ease	repression	in	some	areas	,	but	it	still	keeps	a	tight	grip	in	others	.
For	instance	,	it	releases	Mr.	Sisulu	without	conditions	,	yet	his	son	,	Zwelakhe	,	a	newspaper	editor	,	is	restricted	*-1	to	his	home	much	of	the	day	and	is	n't	allowed	*-1	to	work	as	a	journalist	.
The	ANC	vows	*-1	to	keep	up	pressure	on	the	government	.
Speakers	yesterday	called	on	foreign	governments	*-3	to	increase	sanctions	against	Pretoria	and	urged	supporters	inside	the	country	*-1	to	continue	*-2	defying	emergency	restrictions	and	racial	segregation	,	known	*	as	apartheid	.
``	We	can	not	wait	on	the	government	*-1	to	make	changes	at	its	own	pace	,	''	Mr.	Sisulu	said	*T*-2	.
Because	the	ANC	remains	banned	*-3	,	both	the	government	,	which	*T*-1	approved	the	rally	,	and	the	organizers	,	who	*T*-2	orchestrated	it	,	denied	0	it	was	an	ANC	rally	.
They	both	called	it	a	``	welcome	home	''	gathering	.
Nevertheless	,	an	ANC	rally	by	any	other	name	is	still	an	ANC	rally	.
The	recently	released	leaders	sat	high	atop	a	podium	in	one	section	of	the	stadium	stands	.
Behind	them	was	*T*-2	a	huge	ANC	flag	and	an	even	bigger	sign	that	*T*-1	said	``	ANC	Lives	,	ANC	Leads	.	''
Next	to	them	was	*T*-2	the	red	flag	of	the	outlawed	South	African	Communist	Party	,	which	*T*-1	has	long	been	an	ANC	ally	.
In	the	stands	,	people	waved	ANC	flags	,	wore	ANC	T-shirts	,	sang	ANC	songs	and	chanted	ANC	slogans	.
``	Today	,	''	said	*T*-1	Mr.	Sisulu	,	``	the	ANC	has	captured	the	center	stage	of	political	life	in	South	Africa	.	''
As	a	police	helicopter	circled	overhead	,	Mr.	Sisulu	repeated	the	ANC	's	demands	*ICH*-1	on	the	government	*	to	create	a	climate	for	negotiations	:	*	Release	all	political	prisoners	unconditionally	;	*	lift	all	bans	and	restrictions	on	individuals	and	organizations	;	*	remove	all	troops	from	the	black	townships	;	*	end	the	state	of	emergency	,	and	*	cease	all	political	trials	and	political	executions	.
If	these	conditions	are	met	*-1	,	he	said	0	*T*-2	,	the	ANC	would	be	prepared	*-3	to	discuss	*-4	suspending	its	guerrilla	activities	.
``	There	can	be	no	question	of	us	unilaterally	abandoning	the	armed	struggle	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.	``
To	date	,	we	see	no	clear	indication	that	the	government	is	serious	about	negotiations	.
All	their	utterances	are	vague	.	''
*-2	Echoing	a	phrase	from	Mr.	de	Klerk	,	Mr.	Sisulu	said	,	``	*	Let	all	of	us	who	*T*-1	love	this	country	engage	in	the	task	of	*-3	building	a	new	South	Africa	.
When	Westinghouse	Electric	Corp.	shuttered	its	massive	steam	turbine	plant	in	Lester	,	Pa.	,	three	years	ago	*T*-1	,	it	seemed	like	the	company	had	pulled	the	plug	on	its	century-old	power	generation	business	.
But	now	Westinghouse	is	enjoying	a	resurgence	in	demand	for	both	steam	and	combustion	turbines	and	may	even	join	the	growing	legion	of	independent	electric	producers	.
And	with	its	new	venture	with	Japan	's	Mitsubishi	Heavy	Industries	Ltd.	,	announced	*	last	week	,	it	is	poised	*-1	to	penetrate	growing	markets	overseas	.
For	the	first	time	since	the	mid-1970s	,	Westinghouse	this	year	has	seen	a	significant	increase	in	orders	for	power	plants	.
Most	are	from	independent	producers	instead	of	regulated	utilities	,	and	Westinghouse	believes	0	it	will	ride	a	wave	of	demand	stretching	over	the	next	six	years	.
Analysts	agree	,	*-1	predicting	that	the	revived	market	could	significantly	boost	Westinghouse	's	bottom	line	in	coming	years	.
``	Westinghouse	's	earnings	could	be	materially	enhanced	*-2	in	the	mid-1990s	or	sooner	,	''	says	*T*-1	Russell	L.	Leavitt	,	of	Salomon	Brothers	Inc	.
The	company	expects	a	need	for	140,000	megawatts	of	new	generation	in	the	U.S.	over	the	next	decade	.
Already	this	year	,	it	has	received	orders	for	four	150-megawatt	advanced	combustion	turbines	from	Florida	Power	&	Light	Co.	and	for	two	300-megawatt	plants	from	Intercontinental	Energy	Corp.	,	among	others	.
Westinghouse	's	own	role	as	a	supplier	also	is	changing	.
In	the	past	,	the	company	usually	took	token	equity	positions	in	power	plants	0	it	supplied	*T*-1	as	a	``	kicker	''	*-2	to	close	deals	.
But	last	June	's	annnouncement	that	Westinghouse	would	put	up	all	of	the	$	70	million	*U*	0	*	to	build	a	new	55-megawatt	plant	*T*-1	could	herald	a	new	age	.
Westinghouse	's	plant	will	provide	electrical	power	to	the	Southern	California	Edison	Co.	and	backup	power	and	steam	to	the	U.S.	Borax	&	Chemical	Co	.
``	We	have	n't	decided	on	a	strategy	yet	,	but	we	could	become	an	independent	producer	depending	on	whether	we	're	the	developer	or	just	the	supplier	,	''	says	*T*-1	Theodore	Stern	,	executive	vice	president	of	the	company	's	energy	and	utility	systems	group	.
At	the	same	time	,	Westinghouse	hopes	0	its	venture	with	Mitsubishi	will	help	*-1	fend	off	growing	competition	,	particularly	in	the	U.S.	,	from	such	European	competitors	as	Asea	Brown	Boveri	AG	,	Siemens	AG	,	and	British	General	Electric	Co	.
Under	the	agreement	,	Westinghouse	will	be	able	*-1	to	purchase	smaller	combustion	turbines	from	its	Japanese	partner	,	and	package	and	sell	them	with	its	own	generators	and	other	equipment	.
Westinghouse	also	jointly	will	bid	on	projects	with	Misubishi	,	*	giving	it	an	edge	in	developing	Asian	markets	.
In	addition	,	the	two	companies	will	develop	new	steam	turbine	technology	,	such	as	the	plants	ordered	*	by	Florida	Power	,	and	even	utilize	each	other	's	plants	at	times	*-1	to	take	advantage	of	currency	fluctuations	.
``	Even	though	we	'll	still	compete	against	Mitsubishi	,	we	can	also	work	jointly	on	some	projects	,	and	we	'll	gain	a	lot	of	sourcing	flexibility	,	''	Mr.	Stern	contends	*T*-1	.
The	Westinghouse-Mitsubishi	venture	was	designed	*-1	as	a	non-equity	transaction	,	circumventing	any	possible	antitrust	concerns	.
Westinghouse	carefully	crafted	the	agreement	because	the	Justice	Department	earlier	this	year	successfully	challenged	a	proposed	steam	turbine	joint	venture	with	Asea	Brown	Boveri	.
It	is	expected	that	the	current	surge	in	demand	for	new	power	will	be	filled	*-2	primarily	by	independent	producers	which	,	unlike	utilities	,	*T*-3	are	n't	regulated	*-1	and	therefore	do	n't	need	government	approval	*-1	to	construct	new	plants	.
Westinghouse	expects	about	half	of	its	new	orders	for	turbines	to	come	from	independent	producers	for	at	least	the	next	six	years	.
Despite	shutdowns	of	the	company	's	Lester	and	East	Pittsburgh	plants	,	the	company	believes	0	it	has	sufficient	capacity	0	*	to	meet	near-term	demand	with	its	much	smaller	and	more	efficient	manufacturing	facilities	in	North	Carolina	*T*-1	.
Still	,	Westinghouse	acknowledges	that	demand	from	independent	producers	could	evaporate	if	prices	for	fuel	such	as	natural	gas	or	oil	rise	sharply	or	if	utilities	,	which	*T*-2	have	been	pressured	by	regulators	*-1	to	keep	down	rates	,	are	suddenly	freed	*-3	to	add	significant	generating	capacity	.
Even	if	that	scenario	occurs	,	Westinghouse	figures	0	it	is	prepared	*-1	.
The	company	already	is	gearing	up	for	a	renaissance	of	nuclear	power	even	though	it	has	n't	received	an	order	for	a	domestic	nuclear	plant	in	a	decade	.
John	C.	Marous	,	chairman	and	chief	executive	officer	,	says	0	he	expects	a	commercial	order	*ICH*-2	by	1995	for	the	company	's	AP600	nuclear	power	plant	,	which	*T*-1	is	under	development	.
``	Once	we	see	an	order	,	we	expect	0	it	'll	be	on	line	by	2000	.
Among	the	things	0	I	learned	*T*-2	*-4	covering	the	World	Series	these	past	few	weeks	is	*T*-3	that	the	Richter	scale	,	which	*T*-1	measures	earthquakes	,	is	n't	like	the	one	in	your	bathroom	.
A	quake	that	*T*-1	measures	two	on	the	Richter	is	n't	twice	as	severe	as	a	``	one	''	--	it	's	10	times	worse	.
A	``	three	''	is	10	times	10	again	,	and	so	on	.
That	put	the	``	seven	''	of	Oct.	17	in	perspective	for	me	.
*-1	Think	0	I	'll	buy	one	of	those	``	I	Survived	''	T-shirts	after	all	.
By	Richterian	standards	,	the	show	that	the	Oakland	Athletics	put	on	*T*-1	Friday	and	Saturday	nights	,	in	*-2	putting	a	mercifully	swift	end	to	the	game	's	Longest	Short	Series	,	rated	somewhere	between	a	10	and	an	11	.
The	boys	with	the	white	elephants	on	their	sleeves	might	not	have	made	the	earth	move	much	,	but	they	certainly	did	some	impressive	things	with	baseballs	.
The	Pale	Pachyderms	propelled	six	of	'em	out	of	the	unfriendly	confines	of	Candlestick	Park	during	the	two	games	en	route	to	13-7	and	9-6	wins	over	the	San	Francisco	Giants	.
*-1	Combined	*-2	with	their	two	pre-quake	victories	,	way	back	on	Oct.	14	and	15	-LRB-	the	scores	were	5-0	and	5-1	,	remember	?	-RRB-	,	that	gave	them	a	sweep	of	the	best-of-seven	series	.
The	joke	here	is	that	the	Giants	lost	by	de	fault	.
That	's	geologically	correct	,	but	a	trifle	unfair	otherwise	.
They	showed	up	,	but	did	n't	--	or	could	n't	--	challenge	.
They	led	for	nary	an	inning	in	the	four	games	,	and	managed	*-1	to	stir	their	fans	only	once	.
That	came	in	the	seventh	inning	of	Game	Four	when	,	*-1	trailing	8-2	,	they	scored	four	times	and	brought	their	big	heat	--	Will	Clark	and	Kevin	Mitchell	--	to	the	plate	with	one	out	and	a	runner	on	*T*-2	.
But	Clark	flied	out	to	short	right	field	and	Mitchell	's	drive	to	left	was	caught	*-1	on	the	warning	track	by	Rickey	Henderson	as	62,000	sets	of	lungs	exhaled	as	one	.
``	I	went	out	to	Todd	-LCB-	Burns	,	the	A	's	reliever	-RCB-	and	told	him	that	we	were	n't	gon	*-1	na	let	this	guy	beat	us	,	''	said	*T*-2	*ICH*-3	Oakland	catcher	Terry	Steinbach	of	the	decisive	confrontation	with	Mitchell	,	the	National	League	's	reigning	home-run	king	.
``	I	told	him	*-2	to	make	Mitchell	reach	for	everything	,	and	that	's	what	we	did	*T*-1	.
The	ball	0	he	hit	*T*-1	was	n't	a	strike	.
If	it	had	been	*?*	,	he	mighta	hit	it	out	.	''
But	if	the	A	's	had	n't	won	in	four	,	they	would	have	prevailed	in	five	,	or	six	,	or	seven	.
The	best	team	won	this	Series	,	which	*T*-1	is	more	unusual	than	it	may	sound	*?*	.
Baseball	ai	n't	football	,	where	the	good	teams	beat	up	on	the	bad	ones	.
The	best	baseball	teams	win	six	of	10	games	and	the	worst	win	four	of	10	.
Without	*-1	becoming	overly	contentious	,	*	allow	me	to	suggest	that	several	recent	champions	of	the	world	according	to	us	-LRB-	as	in	U.S.	-RRB-	might	not	have	ranked	No.	1	in	many	polls	.
That	list	includes	last	season	's	champs	,	the	Los	Angeles	Dodgers	,	who	*T*-1	rode	a	miracle	home	run	by	Kirk	Gibson	and	two	faultless	pitching	performances	by	Orel	Hershiser	to	a	five-game	triumph	over	a	bewitched	,	bothered	Oakland	crew	.
These	A	's	,	however	,	got	few	grades	as	low	as	B	on	their	1989	report	card	.
They	led	the	Major	Leagues	in	regular-season	wins	with	99	and	flattened	the	Toronto	Blue	Jays	four	games	to	one	for	the	American	League	pennant	before	*-1	stomping	their	cross-bay	rivals	.
The	pithiest	testimony	to	their	domination	of	the	just-concluded	tournament	came	from	Giants	'	manager	Roger	Craig	after	his	team	had	fallen	in	Game	Three	to	a	five-home-run	barrage	that	*T*-1	tied	a	61-year-old	Series	record	.
*-2	Asked	*-3	what	he	would	do	*T*-1	differently	on	the	morrow	,	Craig	allowed	that	he	might	play	his	outfielders	deeper	,	``	maybe	on	the	other	side	of	the	fence	.	''
The	A	's	offensive	showing	in	the	Series	got	an	A	,	as	in	awesome	.
Their	85	total	bases	broke	a	record	for	a	four-game	set	,	and	their	nine	home	runs	tied	one	.
Eight	Oakland	players	hit	homers	,	with	centerfielder	Dave	Henderson	getting	two	,	both	on	Friday	.
Rickey	Henderson	,	the	do-everything	leadoff	man	,	had	nine	hits	and	set	or	tied	four-game	Series	marks	for	triples	-LRB-	2	-RRB-	and	stolen	bases	-LRB-	3	-RRB-	.
The	sole	A	0	*T*-2	not	to	homer	was	cleanup	hitter	Mark	McGwire	,	their	regular-season	leader	with	33	,	and	he	contributed	five	hits	plus	a	diving	fielding	play	on	a	ground	ball	in	Game	Three	that	*T*-1	stopped	a	Giant	rally	while	the	issue	still	was	in	doubt	.
``	*-5	Think	0	I	'll	redo	my	image	--	get	this	changed	*-4	to	a	glove	,	''	quipped	*T*-1	the	big	first	baseman	Saturday	night	,	*-2	fingering	the	gold	bat	0	he	wears	*T*-3	on	a	neck	chain	.
Even	with	that	power	show	,	though	,	the	Oakland	Series	'	star	,	certified	*	by	the	Most	Valuable	Player	award	,	was	a	pitcher	,	Dave	Stewart	.
He	shut	out	the	Giants	on	five	hits	in	Game	One	,	and	allowed	three	runs	on	five	hits	in	seven	innings	Friday	after	the	12-day	break	caused	*	by	the	earthquake	.
Stewart	's	honor	was	a	nice	note	on	a	couple	of	grounds	.
One	was	that	,	despite	his	62	regular-season	wins	over	the	past	three	seasons	in	the	Land	Beyond	the	Late	News	,	he	has	been	overshadowed	*-2	by	his	more-muscular	mates	and	missed	out	on	prizes	that	*T*-1	might	have	been	his	due	.
The	other	is	that	he	's	an	Oakland	native	,	and	lifted	residents	'	spirits	by	his	visits	to	quake-hit	areas	last	week	.
Afterward	,	as	the	A	's	toasted	their	victory	with	beer	-LRB-	they	dispensed	with	traditional	champagne	showers	in	deference	to	the	quake	victims	-RRB-	,	Stewart	said	0	he	thought	0	his	championship-team	ring	would	outshine	his	individual	trophy	.
``	*	Give	me	four	or	five	more	Series	with	these	guys	,	and	I	do	n't	care	if	I	ever	win	a	Cy	Young	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	,	in	reference	to	baseball	's	best-pitcher	award	.
Indeed	,	the	possibility	of	an	A	's	ring	cycle	,	a\/k\/a	a	dynasty	,	was	a	major	topic	of	post-game	discussion	Saturday	,	so	much	so	that	Sandy	Alderson	,	the	team	's	general	manager	,	felt	obliged	*-1	to	dampen	it	.
``	People	change	,	teams	change	,	''	he	cautioned	*T*-1	.
``	It	*EXP*-2	's	easier	*ICH*-1	*	to	get	worse	than	better	in	this	game	.	''
He	might	have	added	an	interesting	historical	fact	:	The	last	Series	sweep	,	by	the	Cincinnati	Reds	,	came	in	1976	,	which	*T*-1	also	was	the	first	year	of	baseball	player	free	agency	.
It	was	widely	predicted	that	free	agency	would	allow	the	glamorous	,	``	big	market	''	teams	to	monopolize	the	best	talent	,	but	quite	the	opposite	has	occurred	:	Twelve	different	clubs	have	won	titles	in	the	14	seasons	since	its	advent	.
The	number	includes	such	unstylish	burgs	as	,	well	,	Oakland	.
The	rationale	for	*	responding	to	your	customers	'	needs	faster	than	the	competition	can	*?*	is	clear	:	Your	company	will	benefit	in	terms	of	market	share	,	customer	satisfaction	and	profitability	.
In	fact	,	managers	today	are	probably	more	aware	of	speed	as	a	competitive	variable	than	ever	before	.
However	,	for	many	,	*	managing	speed	does	not	come	naturally	.
``	Most	of	us	grew	up	*-2	believing	in	the	axioms	`	Haste	makes	waste	'	and	`	*	Do	n't	cut	corners	,	'	ideas	that	*T*-1	seem	*-4	to	run	counter	to	the	concept	of	*	managing	speed	,	''	says	*T*-3	Dean	Cassell	,	vice	president	for	product	integrity	at	Grumman	Corp	.
``	But	in	the	real	world	,	you	learn	that	speed	and	quality	are	not	a	trade-off	.
Speed	is	a	component	of	quality	--	one	of	the	things	0	we	must	deliver	*T*-1	*-2	to	satisfy	customers	.	''
Companies	that	*T*-2	actually	market	speed	as	part	of	their	service	train	their	managers	to	lead	*RNR*-1	and	participate	in	*RNR*-1	teams	that	*T*-3	increase	speed	and	improve	quality	in	everyday	operations	.
Managers	learn	*-1	to	spot	opportunities	*	to	increase	customer	satisfaction	through	speed	,	and	shift	some	responsibility	for	*	analyzing	,	improving	and	streamlining	work	processes	from	themselves	to	teams	of	employees	.
One	team	at	the	Federal	Express	Ground	Operations	station	in	Natick	,	Mass.	,	focused	on	a	particularly	time-sensitive	operation	:	the	morning	package	sort	.
Every	morning	,	tractor-trailer	trucks	arrive	at	the	Natick	Ground	Station	from	Boston	's	Logan	Airport	,	*-1	carrying	the	day	's	package	load	.
In	peak	periods	that	load	may	include	4,000	pieces	.
The	packages	must	be	sorted	*-1	quickly	and	distributed	*-1	to	smaller	vans	for	delivery	,	so	couriers	can	be	on	the	road	by	8:35	.
No	customer	is	present	at	the	morning	package	sort	,	but	the	process	is	nevertheless	critical	to	customer	satisfaction	.
``	We	're	committed	*-2	to	deliver	the	customer	's	package	by	a	stated	time	,	usually	10:30	,	''	notes	*T*-3	Glenn	Mortimer	,	a	Federal	Express	courier	who	*T*-1	led	the	Natick	team	.
``	The	sooner	our	vans	hit	the	road	each	morning	,	the	easier	it	*EXP*-1	is	*?*	for	us	to	fulfill	that	obligation	.	''
*-2	Following	a	problem-solving	formula	used	*	by	teams	throughout	Federal	Express	,	members	of	the	Natick	team	monitored	their	morning	routine	,	*-2	carefully	noting	where	and	when	the	work	group	's	resources	were	used	*-1	effectively	*T*-3	and	where	they	were	idle	,	*-4	waiting	for	others	upstream	in	the	process	to	send	packages	their	way	*T*-5	.
``	We	suspected	0	there	was	downtime	built	*	into	our	process	.
But	we	did	n't	know	just	where	it	was	*T*-1	until	we	completed	our	data	gathering	,	''	Mr.	Mortimer	says	*T*-2	.
``	We	used	the	data	*-1	to	redesign	our	sorting	system	and	put	our	resources	where	they	could	do	the	most	good	*T*-2	.	''
The	team	even	created	a	points	system	0	*T*-2	to	identify	those	couriers	and	subgroups	that	*T*-1	were	doing	the	most	0	*T*-4	to	reduce	package-sort	cycle	time	.
Winners	of	the	friendly	competition	earn	a	steak	dinner	*ICH*-1	out	with	their	spouses	.
``	Monitoring	shows	that	the	Natick	team	's	new	system	really	does	reduce	cycle	time	for	the	morning	package	sort	,	''	reports	*T*-1	James	Barksdale	,	chief	operating	officer	at	Federal	Express	.
``	The	vans	leave	at	least	15	minutes	earlier	,	on	average	,	than	they	used	*-1	to	*?*	.
And	service	levels	have	increased	to	the	point	where	they	're	consistently	above	99	%	*T*-1	.	''
A	cross-functional	team	at	Union	Carbide	's	Tonawanda	,	N.Y.	,	facility	,	which	*T*-1	produces	air-separation	plants	,	followed	a	similar	path	*-2	to	reduce	manufacturing	cycle	time	.
``	The	team	included	craftsmen	from	the	shop	floor	as	well	as	engineering	,	scheduling	and	purchasing	personnel	,	''	reports	*T*-1	Alan	Westendorf	,	director	of	quality	.
``	First	,	they	produced	a	flowchart	detailing	the	process	by	which	an	air-separation	plant	actually	gets	built	*-2	*T*-1	.
Then	they	identified	snags	in	the	process	.	''
The	Tonawanda	team	determined	that	holdups	for	inspections	were	the	main	problem	and	identified	which	kinds	of	delays	*T*-1	involved	critical	inspections	and	which	*T*-2	were	less	critical	or	could	be	handled	*-3	by	workers	already	on	the	line	.
The	team	then	proposed	modifications	in	their	work	process	to	management	.
``	The	streamlined	manufacturing	process	benefits	our	customers	in	at	least	two	ways	,	''	Mr.	Westendorf	concludes	*T*-1	.
``	First	,	we	have	better	quality	assurance	than	ever	,	because	the	people	building	the	product	have	taken	on	more	responsibility	for	the	quality	of	their	own	work	.
Second	,	we	trimmed	more	than	a	month	off	the	time	required	*	*	to	deliver	a	finished	product	.	''
At	Grumman	's	Aircraft	Systems	Division	,	a	cross-functional	team	reduced	the	cycle	time	required	*	*	to	produce	a	new	business	proposal	for	an	important	government	contract	.
The	team	was	composed	*-1	of	representatives	from	engineering	,	manufacturing	,	corporate	estimating	,	flight	test	,	material	,	quality	control	,	and	other	departments	.
``	We	needed	contributions	from	all	these	departments	*-1	to	generate	the	proposal	,	''	says	*T*-2	Carl	Anton	,	configuration-data	manager	for	Grumman	's	A-6	combat	aircraft	program	.
``	But	instead	of	*-5	gathering	their	input	piecemeal	,	we	formed	the	team	,	which	*T*-2	reached	consensus	on	the	proposal	objectives	and	produced	a	statement	of	work	0	*T*-4	to	guide	all	the	functions	that	*T*-3	were	involved	*-1	.	''
*-1	Armed	*-2	with	this	shared	understanding	and	requisite	background	information	,	each	department	developed	its	specialized	contribution	to	the	proposal	,	*-1	submitting	data	and	cost	estimates	on	a	closely	managed	schedule	.
``	We	cleared	up	questions	and	inconsistencies	very	quickly	,	because	the	people	who	*T*-1	had	the	skills	and	perspective	required	*	*	to	resolve	them	were	part	of	the	task	team	,	''	Mr.	Anton	explains	*T*-2	.
The	team	trimmed	more	than	two	months	from	the	cycle	time	previously	required	*	*	to	develop	comparable	proposals	.
``	The	team	eliminated	the	crisis	mentality	that	proposal	deadlines	can	generate	*T*-1	.
The	result	was	a	more	thoughtful	,	complete	and	competitive	proposal	,	''	Mr.	Anton	concludes	*T*-1	.
The	successes	achieved	*	at	Federal	Express	,	Union	Carbide	and	Grumman	suggest	that	*	managing	speed	may	be	an	underutilized	source	of	competitive	advantage	.
Managers	in	all	three	companies	recognize	speed	as	a	component	of	quality	and	a	key	to	customer	satisfaction	.

Home	taping	of	pre-recorded	music	cuts	into	record	industry	revenues	,	but	*	banning	home	taping	would	hurt	consumers	even	more	.
That	's	the	conclusion	of	an	independent	report	prepared	*	by	the	Office	of	Technology	Assessment	at	the	request	of	the	House	and	Senate	judiciary	committees	.
The	report	is	*-2	to	be	released	*-1	today	.
The	report	says	0	the	availability	of	such	advanced	analog	recording	equipment	as	cassette	recorders	does	n't	seem	*-1	to	increase	the	quantity	of	home	copying	.
That	finding	,	the	report	says	0	*T*-1	,	casts	doubt	on	the	record	industry	's	contention	that	the	new	generation	of	digital	recording	equipment	will	inevitably	lead	to	wholesale	abuse	of	copyrighted	material	by	home	tapers	.
The	longstanding	position	of	the	Recording	Industry	Association	of	America	,	a	trade	group	based	*	in	Washington	,	D.C.	,	is	that	record	companies	,	performers	,	songwriters	and	music	publishers	need	*-2	to	be	remunerated	*-1	by	government-imposed	fees	on	the	sale	of	blank	tapes	and	recording	equipment	*	to	make	up	for	royalties	lost	*	to	home	taping	.
``	I	think	0	it	is	a	nail	in	the	coffin	in	any	royalty	tax	proposal	,	''	says	*T*-1	Gary	Shapiro	,	vice	president	for	government	and	legal	affairs	of	the	Electronic	Industries	Association	in	Washington	.
``	What	-LCB-	the	report	-RCB-	shows	*T*-1	is	everything	0	we	've	been	saying	*T*-2	for	the	past	eight	or	nine	years	--	that	audio	taping	is	the	best	thing	0	*T*-3	to	happen	for	the	recording	industry	.
The	people	who	*T*-1	tape	the	most	buy	the	most	.	''
Trish	Heimers	,	a	spokesperson	for	RIAA	says	0	her	organization	has	n't	received	a	copy	of	the	completed	report	yet	and	has	no	immediate	comment	.
A	recent	agreement	between	the	recording	industry	and	electronics	manufacturers	requires	that	any	digital	audio	tape	,	or	DAT	,	recorder	sold	*	in	the	U.S.	have	a	built-in	device	that	*T*-1	restricts	its	ability	*	to	make	second	copies	from	DAT	tape	copies	of	digital	compact	disks	.
But	the	disappointing	sales	of	DAT	machines	here	and	abroad	so	far	have	not	seemed	*-2	to	warrant	the	three	years	of	legal	wrangling	that	*T*-1	went	into	the	agreement	.
Under	current	copyright	laws	,	it	*EXP*-3	is	considered	*-1	``	fair	use	''	*	to	reproduce	copyrighted	material	for	one	's	personal	use	or	for	use	by	one	's	family	or	friends	,	while	*	copying	for	purposes	of	resale	or	profit	is	prohibited	*-2	.
A	survey	contained	*	in	the	291-page	report	,	``	Copyright	and	Home	Copying	:	Technology	Challenges	the	Law	,	''	found	that	most	people	consider	home	copying	for	such	personal	use	a	``	right	''	--	a	right	,	moreover	,	that	*T*-2	was	exercised	*-1	by	40	%	of	Americans	over	the	age	of	10	in	the	past	year	.
The	study	says	that	the	``	ambiguous	legal	status	''	of	home	copying	makes	it	*EXP*-1	``	appropriate	*	to	examine	the	effects	on	consumers	,	as	well	as	on	industry	.	''
Reports	by	the	Office	of	Technology	Assessment	do	n't	prescribe	any	specific	legislative	action	but	suggest	a	range	of	options	that	Congress	may	pursue	*T*-1	.
The	study	also	says	that	advent	of	new	communications	technologies	makes	``	an	explicit	congressional	definition	of	the	legal	status	of	home	copying	more	desirable	in	order	*	to	reduce	legal	and	market	uncertainties	and	*	to	prevent	de	facto	changes	to	copyright	law	through	technology	,	''	and	says	that	*	finding	an	``	appropriate	balance	of	harms	and	benefits	is	a	political	decision	,	not	a	technical	one	.

And	in	little	more	than	a	decade	of	*	being	friendly	--	and	at	the	same	time	rocking	the	staid	Swiss	business	community	with	some	U.S.-style	wheeling	and	dealing	--	the	46-year-old	Mr.	Rey	has	grown	from	a	modest	banker	to	a	billionaire	.
He	achieved	this	in	part	with	an	uncanny	talent	for	*-1	getting	his	foot	peacefully	in	the	door	of	established	European	companies	.
His	latest	coup	:	September	's	masterminding	of	the	five	billion	Swiss-franc	-LRB-	$	3.07	billion	*U*	-RRB-	merger	between	Adia	S.A.	,	the	world	's	second-largest	temporary	employment	agency	,	and	Inspectorate	International	S.A.	,	a	Rey-controlled	product-inspection	company	.
Shareholders	must	approve	the	merger	at	general	meetings	of	the	two	companies	in	late	November	.
But	approval	is	almost	certain	since	Mr.	Rey	and	a	friendly	Adia	management	are	in	control	.
After	the	transaction	,	Mr.	Rey	estimates	0	the	value	of	his	20	%	stake	in	the	new	company	,	0	*T*-2	to	be	held	*-1	by	his	Omni	Holding	AG	,	will	be	about	1	billion	Swiss	francs	.
This	will	be	his	return	on	an	original	investment	of	between	50	million	Swiss	francs	and	80	million	Swiss	francs	.
Mr.	Rey	bought	a	controlling	stake	in	Inspectorate	for	18	million	Swiss	francs	in	1982	,	*-1	building	up	the	little-known	engineering	company	with	European	and	U.S.	acquisitions	.

In	short	:	Rey	found	companies	with	weak	earnings	but	rich	assets	.	''
However	,	the	Swiss	financial	press	in	general	,	as	well	as	many	analysts	,	have	had	a	hard	time	*	making	up	their	minds	about	Mr.	Rey	and	his	un-Swiss	ways	.
For	Switzerland	's	most	prestigious	newspaper	,	Neue	Zuercher	Zeitung	,	Mr.	Rey	seems	destined	*-2	to	remain	the	``	former	Bally	raider	,	''	an	image	that	*T*-1	has	proved	hard	0	*	to	overcome	*T*-3	.
In	1976	,	as	an	upstart	in	the	eyes	of	Switzerland	's	establishment	,	Mr.	Rey	laid	the	foundations	of	his	present-day	prominence	with	an	unheard-of	raid	on	Bally	,	the	country	's	traditional	shoemaker	.
*-1	Sitting	beside	a	banker	at	a	luncheon	in	London	,	where	he	was	working	as	a	financial	consultant	*T*-2	,	he	learned	that	a	large	packet	of	Bally	's	shares	was	up	for	sale	.
*-2	Looking	into	Bally	,	he	could	hardly	believe	what	he	saw	*T*-1	:	a	company	with	enormous	real-estate	holdings	in	major	European	cities	and	a	market	capitalization	of	28	million	Swiss	francs	;	it	had	7,000	employees	.
*-1	Investing	four	million	Swiss	francs	earned	*	from	his	financial	transactions	and	two	million	Swiss	francs	from	his	parents	and	his	wife	,	Mr.	Rey	acquired	20	%	of	Bally	's	shares	.
But	such	tactics	were	alien	to	Switzerland	in	1976	,	and	still	are	n't	common	because	of	share	restrictions	that	companies	are	allowed	*-2	to	maintain	*T*-1	.
Eventually	,	Mr.	Rey	was	forced	*-1	to	sell	his	Bally	shares	to	the	weapons	maker	Oerlikon-Buehrle	Holding	AG	as	establishment	pressure	*ICH*-2	grew	on	this	hostile	move	into	the	Swiss	old	boys	'	network	.
Mr.	Rey	made	50	million	Swiss	francs	on	the	sale	.
``	Bally	was	not	an	unfriendly	takeover	,	''	he	insists	*T*-1	.
*	Buying	from	willing	shareholders	makes	an	unfriendly	takeover	impossible	,	Mr.	Rey	contends	0	*T*-1	.
``	I	bought	from	willing	shareholders	.	''
Nevertheless	,	Mr.	Rey	has	been	very	careful	since	then	*	to	make	sure	0	his	moves	are	welcome	.
And	he	has	worked	*-1	to	shed	his	raider	image	.
In	1979	,	his	career	as	an	industrialist	began	with	the	acquisition	of	the	Swiss	metals	works	Selve	,	based	*	in	Thun	.
With	the	nonferrous	metals	business	undermined	*-1	in	Switzerland	by	tough	foreign	competition	and	high	domestic	costs	,	this	looked	like	a	dull	undertaking	.
But	Mr.	Rey	brought	about	a	merger	in	the	next	few	years	between	the	country	's	major	producers	;	the	increased	efficiency	has	perked	up	the	industry	.
Three	years	later	,	machinery	producer	Ateliers	de	Constructions	Mecaniques	de	Vevey	S.A.	was	*-1	to	become	part	of	the	Rey	empire	.
Once	again	the	company	's	future	looked	less	than	rosy	.
But	after	restructuring	under	new	management	,	the	profits	began	rolling	in	.
A	major	boost	to	Mr.	Rey	's	respectability	among	the	Swiss	came	in	1986	when	he	sold	60	%	of	his	Phibro	Bank	to	the	conservative	Swiss	cantonal	banks	*T*-1	.
They	renamed	it	Swiss	Cantobank	and	are	using	it	*-1	to	expand	abroad	.
In	1987	,	Mr.	Rey	bested	leading	publishing	houses	*-1	to	take	over	Switzerland	's	Jean	Frey	AG	,	a	major	producer	of	magazines	and	newspapers	.
And	with	the	recent	acquisition	of	30	%	of	Winterthur-based	machinery	manufacturer	Gebrueder	Sulzer	AG	,	Mr.	Rey	has	enjoyed	the	status	of	white	knight	.
Sulzer	preferred	him	to	financier	Tito	Tettamanti	,	whose	secretive	raid	on	the	company	's	stock	*T*-1	had	led	to	a	bitter	battle	.
Meanwhile	,	as	such	strategic	investments	have	mounted	,	the	merchant-banking	arm	of	Mr.	Rey	's	Omni	Holding	has	been	busily	buying	and	selling	dozens	of	companies	,	often	after	a	financial	or	corporate	restructuring	.
Today	,	this	branch	of	Mr.	Rey	's	empire	runs	under	the	name	Omnicorp	Offering	Services	and	handles	mergers	and	acquisitions	,	placement	of	securities	and	real	estate	.
In	its	portfolio	are	*T*-2	such	diverse	companies	as	United	Kingdom-based	Air	Europe	;	Checkrobot	Inc.	,	a	U.S.	company	that	*T*-1	makes	supermarket	checkout	machines	;	Norment	Industries	,	a	U.S.	manufacturer	of	securities	systems	;	Com	Systems	Inc.	,	a	U.S.	regional	telephone	company	;	and	major	real-estate	projects	in	the	U.S.	and	Europe	.
For	financial	analysts	,	*-1	reading	Omni	's	accounts	is	a	tough	challenge	.
``	Companies	move	in	and	out	,	''	says	*T*-1	Helga	Kern	of	KK	Swiss	Investment	.
Financial	analysts	note	that	Mr.	Rey	is	attracted	*-1	to	companies	that	*T*-3	are	undervalued	*-2	on	the	basis	of	their	real-estate	interests	.
In	August	,	Omni	unexpectedly	bought	Inspectorate	's	80	%	stake	in	Harpener	AG	of	West	Germany	,	a	land-rich	company	.
The	internal	transaction	within	the	Rey	empire	puzzled	Harpener	's	small	shareholders	,	but	analysts	say	0	it	*EXP*-1	makes	sense	for	Inspectorate-Adia	to	focus	on	its	main	businesses	of	product	inspection	and	temporary	help	.
Mr.	Rey	says	0	the	move	is	yet	another	example	of	his	conservatism	.
He	explains	that	companies	with	real	estate	give	``	security	.	''
The	real	estate	can	be	used	*-1	,	he	points	out	0	*T*-2	,	as	guarantees	for	bank	loans	for	corporate	development	.
He	says	0	he	wants	*-1	to	``	influence	''	but	not	``	manage	''	companies	.
``	I	do	n't	want	*-1	to	be	like	-LCB-	financier	Alan	-RCB-	Bond	and	the	other	Australians	.
I	do	n't	want	companies	to	be	built	*-1	around	me	as	a	person	.
I	want	them	to	stand	alone	.
Ultimate	Corp.	signed	a	letter	of	intent	*	to	market	Hewlett-Packard	Co.	minicomputers	,	the	companies	said	0	*T*-1	.
Ultimate	expects	the	3	1\/2-year	agreement	to	generate	$	100	million	*U*	in	sales	,	but	it	would	n't	estimate	profit	.
Under	terms	of	the	pact	,	Ultimate	,	a	computer-systems	concern	,	will	market	the	full	line	of	HP	9000	series	800	multipleuser	minicomputers	.
Hewlett-Packard	is	based	*-1	in	Palo	Alto	,	Calif	.
In	the	second	step	of	a	reorganization	that	*T*-1	began	earlier	this	year	,	Boeing	Co.	said	0	it	will	create	a	Defense	and	Space	Group	0	*T*-2	to	consolidate	several	divisions	.
Meanwhile	,	Boeing	officials	and	representatives	of	the	Machinists	union	met	separately	last	night	with	a	federal	mediator	in	an	attempt	*	to	break	the	month-old	strike	that	*T*-1	has	shut	the	aerospace	giant	's	assembly	lines	at	a	time	when	it	has	an	$	80	billion	*U*	backlog	of	jetliner	orders	*T*-2	.
The	two	sides	were	scheduled	*-1	to	meet	with	the	mediator	this	morning	.
Machinists	already	have	rejected	a	package	that	*T*-1	would	provide	a	10	%	pay	raise	plus	bonuses	over	the	three-year	life	of	the	contract	.
Boeing	has	said	repeatedly	0	it	wo	n't	expand	its	offer	and	the	machinists	have	responded	that	the	offer	is	n't	good	enough	.
However	,	the	resolve	of	some	of	the	striking	57,000	machinists	might	be	weakening	.
About	1,000	strikers	signed	petitions	last	week	*-1	calling	for	Boeing	and	Machinists	representatives	to	schedule	new	meetings	.
The	two	sides	had	n't	met	since	Oct.	18	.
While	Boeing	's	commercial	business	is	booming	,	its	military	business	is	feeling	the	effects	of	a	declining	defense	budget	after	a	strong	buildup	during	the	Reagan	presidency	.
In	May	,	the	company	consolidated	its	Aerospace	and	Electronics	groups	;	the	new	Defense	and	Space	Group	will	contain	the	Aerospace	and	Electronics	division	and	Advanced	Systems	,	both	based	*	in	the	Seattle	area	;	Boeing	Helicopters	in	Philadelphia	;	Boeing	Military	Airplanes	in	Wichita	,	Kan.	,	and	ArgoSystems	in	Sunnyvale	,	Calif	.
B.	Dan	Pinick	,	president	of	Boeing	Aerospace	and	Electronics	,	will	become	president	of	the	new	group	,	which	*T*-1	will	become	operational	Jan.	2	.
In	addition	,	Boeing	said	0	it	also	will	reorganize	all	its	work	in	Wichita	into	military	and	commercial	divisions	.
All	of	the	changes	will	reduce	its	overhead	and	streamline	operations	,	Boeing	said	0	*T*-1	.
Analysts	agreed	.
``	It	's	a	further	step	to	better	returns	in	the	hemorrhaging	defense	business	,	''	said	*T*-1	Steven	Binder	,	an	analyst	with	Bear	,	Stearns	&	Co.	in	New	York	.
``	They	had	*-1	to	do	it	.	''
Howard	Rubel	,	an	analyst	with	C.J.	Lawrence	,	Morgan	Grenfell	Inc.	in	New	York	,	said	0	the	shift	reflects	Boeing	confidence	in	Mr.	Pinick	,	described	*	by	Mr.	Rubel	as	an	expert	on	*	doing	business	with	the	military	.
``	His	side	of	the	business	has	been	successful	in	a	tough	environment	,	''	Mr.	Rubel	said	*T*-1	.
A	two-day	meeting	of	representatives	of	Cocom	,	the	17-nation	group	that	*T*-1	oversees	exports	of	sensitive	goods	to	communist	countries	,	did	n't	take	any	substantive	decisions	on	*	trimming	the	list	of	items	under	controls	.
Nor	did	it	ease	restrictions	on	exports	to	Poland	and	Hungary	,	according	to	U.S.	officials	who	*T*-1	attended	the	talks	.
The	U.S.	had	been	under	pressure	*ICH*-2	from	several	Cocom	members	,	especially	France	,	West	Germany	and	Italy	,	*	to	ease	restrictions	on	some	types	of	machine	tools	,	which	those	countries	argued	0	*T*-1	were	now	widely	available	to	East	Bloc	countries	from	non-Cocom	members	.
For	several	years	some	European	countries	have	complained	that	outdated	Cocom	lists	and	restrictions	served	more	*ICH*-1	*	to	hamper	their	trade	than	*	to	add	to	Western	security	.
Some	countries	also	have	been	pressing	for	special	treatment	for	Hungary	and	Poland	as	they	move	toward	more	democratic	rule	,	just	as	special	treatment	*ICH*-2	had	been	agreed	on	*-1	for	China	.
But	U.S.	officials	said	0	representatives	at	the	meeting	decided	that	this	was	``	a	matter	for	further	discussion	at	future	meetings	.	''
They	added	that	``	all	of	us	-LRB-	Cocom	members	-RRB-	look	at	the	changes	in	Hungary	and	Poland	in	a	positive	way	,	but	a	question	of	this	scope	deserves	further	discussion	and	study	.	''
The	officials	also	said	0	the	meeting	agreed	*-1	to	continue	*-2	treating	China	as	a	special	case	,	despite	the	recent	repression	of	dissent	there	,	but	to	offer	no	further	concessions	.
The	U.S.	officials	said	that	despite	the	rapid	changes	under	way	in	Eastern	Europe	and	the	Soviet	Union	,	all	the	Cocom	members	agreed	on	``	the	continuing	need	for	this	organization	,	''	which	*T*-2	was	founded	*-1	40	years	ago	at	the	start	of	the	Cold	War	.
The	officials	said	0	the	meeting	agreed	*-3	to	continue	*-2	working	toward	*-4	``	streamlining	''	Cocom	's	restricted	products	list	,	and	to	improve	procedures	for	*	punishing	companies	that	*T*-1	do	n't	comply	with	the	export	restrictions	.
The	officials	said	0	this	meeting	``	put	in	motion	''	procedural	steps	that	*T*-2	would	speed	up	both	of	these	functions	,	but	that	no	specific	decisions	*ICH*-3	were	taken	*-1	on	either	matter	.
Unisys	Corp.	's	announcement	Friday	of	a	$	648.2	million	*U*	loss	for	the	third	quarter	showed	that	the	company	is	moving	even	faster	than	*	expected	*-1	to	take	write-offs	on	its	various	problems	and	prepare	for	a	turnaround	next	year	.
At	the	same	time	,	the	sheer	size	of	the	loss	,	coupled	*	with	a	slowing	of	orders	,	made	some	securities	analysts	wonder	just	how	strong	that	turnaround	will	be	*T*-1	at	the	computer	maker	and	defense-electronics	concern	.
``	Unisys	is	getting	clobbered	*-1	.
*	Just	clobbered	*-3	,	''	said	*T*-2	Ulric	Weil	,	an	analyst	at	Weil	&	Associates	who	*T*-1	had	once	been	high	on	the	company	.
``	The	quarter	was	terrible	,	and	the	future	looks	anything	but	encouraging	.	''
Unisys	,	whose	revenue	*T*-1	inched	up	3.7	%	in	the	quarter	to	$	2.35	billion	*U*	from	$	2.27	billion	*U*	in	the	year-earlier	quarter	,	had	an	operating	loss	of	about	$	30	million	*U*	.
On	top	of	that	,	the	Blue	Bell	,	Pa.	,	concern	took	a	$	230	million	*U*	charge	related	to	the	layoffs	of	8,000	employees	.
That	is	at	the	high	end	of	the	range	of	7,000	to	8,000	employees	that	Unisys	said	a	month	ago	0	*T*-2	would	be	laid	*-1	off	.
Unisys	said	0	that	should	help	it	save	$	500	million	*U*	a	year	in	costs	,	again	at	the	high	end	of	the	previously	reported	range	of	$	400	million	to	$	500	million	*U*	.
The	company	also	took	a	write-off	of	$	150	million	*U*	*-1	to	cover	losses	on	some	fixed-price	defense	contracts	,	as	some	new	managers	took	a	hard	look	at	the	prospects	for	that	slow-growing	business	.
In	addition	,	Unisys	set	up	an	unspecified	reserve	--	apparently	$	60	million	to	$	70	million	*U*	--	*-1	to	cover	the	minimum	amount	0	it	will	have	*-2	to	pay	the	government	*T*-3	because	of	its	involvement	in	the	defense-procurement	scandal	.
Unisys	also	noted	that	it	paid	$	78.8	million	*U*	in	taxes	during	the	quarter	,	even	though	tax	payments	normally	would	be	minimal	in	a	quarter	that	*T*-1	produced	such	a	big	loss	.
The	tax	payments	will	leave	Unisys	with	$	225	million	*U*	in	loss	carry-forwards	that	*T*-1	will	cut	tax	payments	in	future	quarters	.
In	addition	,	Unisys	said	0	it	reduced	computer	inventories	a	further	$	100	million	*U*	during	the	quarter	,	*	leaving	it	within	$	100	million	*U*	of	its	goal	of	a	reduction	of	$	500	million	*U*	by	the	end	of	the	year	.
Still	,	Unisys	said	0	its	European	business	was	weak	during	the	quarter	,	a	worrisome	sign	given	that	the	company	has	relied	on	solid	results	overseas	*-1	to	overcome	weakness	in	the	U.S.	over	the	past	several	quarters	.
The	company	also	reported	slower	growth	in	another	important	business	:	systems	that	*T*-1	use	the	Unix	operating	system	.
That	would	be	a	huge	problem	if	it	were	*-3	to	continue	,	because	Unisys	is	betting	its	business	on	the	assumption	that	customers	want	*-4	to	move	away	from	*-5	using	operating	systems	that	*T*-1	run	on	only	one	manufacturer	's	equipment	and	toward	systems	--	mainly	Unix	--	that	*T*-2	work	on	almost	anyone	's	machines	.
In	addition	,	Unisys	must	deal	with	its	increasingly	oppressive	debt	load	.
Debt	has	risen	to	around	$	4	billion	*U*	,	or	about	50	%	of	total	capitalization	.
That	means	0	Unisys	must	pay	about	$	100	million	*U*	in	interest	every	quarter	,	on	top	of	$	27	million	*U*	in	dividends	on	preferred	stock	.
Jim	Unruh	,	Unisys	's	president	,	said	0	he	is	approaching	next	year	with	caution	.
He	said	0	the	strength	of	the	world-wide	economy	is	suspect	,	and	does	n't	see	much	revenue	growth	in	the	cards	.
He	also	said	that	the	price	wars	flaring	up	in	parts	of	the	computer	industry	will	continue	through	next	year	.
He	said	0	the	move	toward	standard	operating	systems	means	0	customers	are	n't	locked	*-1	into	*-2	buying	from	their	traditional	computer	supplier	and	can	force	prices	down	.
That	,	he	said	0	*T*-2	,	is	why	Unisys	is	overhauling	its	whole	business	*T*-1	:	It	needs	*-3	to	prepare	for	a	world	in	which	profit	margins	will	be	lower	than	computer	companies	have	been	used	*-5	to	*?*	*T*-4	.
``	We	've	approached	this	not	as	a	response	to	a	temporary	condition	in	the	industry	but	as	a	fundamental	change	0	the	industry	is	going	through	*T*-1	,	''	Mr.	Unruh	said	*T*-2	.
``	The	information-systems	industry	is	still	going	*-1	to	be	a	high-growth	business	,	and	we	're	confident	that	we	*ICH*-2	have	tremendous	assets	as	a	company	.
But	we	do	n't	minimize	the	challenges	of	the	near	term	.	''
Securities	analysts	were	even	more	cautious	,	*-1	having	been	burned	*-2	repeatedly	on	Unisys	this	year	.
Some	had	predicted	earnings	of	more	than	$	4	*U*	a	share	for	this	year	,	up	from	last	year	's	fully	diluted	$	3.27	*U*	a	share	on	earnings	of	$	680.6	million	*U*	.
But	the	company	said	Friday	that	it	had	losses	of	$	673.3	million	*U*	through	the	first	nine	months	,	compared	with	earnings	a	year	earlier	of	$	382.2	million	*U*	,	or	$	2.22	*U*	a	share	fully	diluted	,	as	revenue	inched	up	1.4	%	to	$	7.13	billion	*U*	from	$	7.03	billion	*U*	.
And	Unisys	is	expected	*-1	to	do	little	better	than	*-2	break	even	in	the	fourth	quarter	.
So	Steve	Milunovich	at	First	Boston	said	0	he	is	cutting	his	earnings	estimate	for	next	year	to	$	2	*U*	a	share	from	$	3	*U*	.
``	I	was	feeling	like	I	was	too	high	*-2	to	begin	with	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Weil	of	Weil	&	Associates	said	0	he	will	remain	at	$	1	*U*	a	share	for	next	year	but	said	0	he	wonders	whether	even	that	low	target	is	at	risk	.
``	The	break-even	point	for	next	year	is	much	lower	,	but	is	it	low	enough	?	''	he	asked	*T*-1	.
*-1	Reflecting	the	concern	,	Unisys	stock	fell	a	further	75	cents	to	$	16.25	*U*	in	composite	trading	Friday	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	.
If	a	TV	weatherman	gets	butterflies	*-1	facing	the	camera	again	after	a	questionable	forecast	,	Donald	H.	Straszheim	surely	understands	.
The	chief	economist	of	Merrill	Lynch	&	Co.	finds	himself	in	such	a	position	as	he	buzzes	the	Midwest	on	his	first	road	trip	since	*	backpedaling	on	a	major	prediction	.
Mr.	Straszheim	expects	0	he	will	take	some	heat	,	and	he	's	right	.
Since	the	last	time	0	he	traveled	this	way	*T*-1	several	months	ago	,	he	has	recanted	a	series	of	bold	forecasts	of	a	recession	.
In	February	1988	,	for	example	,	Merrill	Lynch	's	weekly	commentary	announced	that	``	the	economy	is	likely	*-1	to	fall	into	recession	in	early	1989	.	''
The	forecasts	were	widely	disseminated	,	and	,	in	a	splashy	ad	campaign	launched	*	in	the	summer	of	1988	,	Merrill	Lynch	urged	investors	*-1	to	buy	bonds	.
It	said	0	long-term	interest	rates	,	then	above	9	%	,	could	drop	to	7	%	by	the	end	of	1989	,	so	bonds	,	which	*T*-1	benefit	from	falling	rates	,	would	be	a	good	buy	.
The	firm	also	raised	the	percentage	of	bonds	in	its	model	portfolio	from	40	%	to	45	%	and	later	to	55	%	.
But	this	September	--	just	when	many	market	economists	,	including	some	at	Merrill	Lynch	,	believed	that	Mr.	Straszheim	was	about	*-2	to	be	proved	*-1	right	*T*-3	--	he	took	a	detour	if	not	a	U-turn	.
He	softened	the	talk	about	a	recession	.
Now	,	in	fact	,	he	is	predicting	economic	growth	of	2.9	%	this	year	and	2.1	%	next	year	,	a	more	optimistic	outlook	than	the	consensus	of	some	four	dozen	top	forecasters	surveyed	*	by	Blue	Chip	Economic	Indicators	newsletter	.
And	,	just	recently	,	Merrill	Lynch	cut	the	recommended	bondholdings	back	to	50	%	.
While	such	changes	might	sound	minor	,	they	are	n't	*?*	:	Merrill	Lynch	manages	or	oversees	some	$	300	billion	*U*	in	retail	accounts	that	*T*-2	include	everything	from	mutual	funds	to	individual	annuities	.
Two	well-known	colleagues	who	*T*-1	believe	0	Mr.	Straszheim	was	right	the	first	time	are	David	Bostian	Jr.	and	A.	Gary	Shilling	,	both	of	whom	*T*-2	run	their	own	New	York	research	firms	.
Mr.	Bostian	said	in	August	that	his	macroeconomic	index	signaled	recession	.
Mr.	Shilling	,	who	*T*-1	was	Merrill	Lynch	's	chief	economist	from	1967	to	1971	,	has	heralded	a	recession	for	months	.
``	My	own	personal	opinion	is	that	Don	threw	in	the	towel	just	about	the	time	0	he	should	have	doubled	his	bet	*T*-2	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
Now	a	rocky	stock	market	and	weak	corporate	profits	may	further	threaten	the	economy	.
And	Mr.	Straszheim	conceded	after	a	recent	drop	in	manufacturing	jobs	that	``	it	*EXP*-3	may	prove	*-2	to	be	the	case	that	we	got	whipsawed	*-1	--	that	we	pulled	the	recession	forecast	at	just	the	wrong	time	.	''
He	adds	,	``	That	's	the	forecasting	business	.	''
However	risky	the	business	*T*-1	,	it	's	brisk	these	days	.
*-2	Pestered	*-1	by	bosses	,	brokers	,	clients	and	media	people	and	pushed	*-1	by	their	own	egos	,	Wall	Street	economists	are	forecasting	about	everything	from	broad	economic	trends	to	the	dinkiest	monthly	indicator	.
But	the	surprisingly	durable	seven-year	economic	expansion	has	made	mincemeat	of	more	than	one	forecast	.
This	is	n't	the	quiet	economic	science	practiced	*	in	the	universities	.
This	is	the	commercial	version	.
*-2	Carrying	the	new	message	on	the	road	,	Mr.	Straszheim	meets	confrontation	that	*T*-1	often	occurs	in	inverse	proportion	to	the	size	of	the	client	.
No	sophisticated	professional	expects	economists	to	be	right	all	the	time	.
Some	smaller	clients	do	n't	seem	*-1	to	notice	his	switch	.
But	with	some	clients	,	the	talk	can	heat	up	a	bit	.
Dennis	O'Brien	,	the	treasurer	of	Commonwealth	Edison	Co.	in	Chicago	,	adopts	a	polite	approach	,	*-1	waiting	for	an	opportunity	*	to	ask	about	the	forecast	.
A	good	half-hour	into	breakfast	at	the	Palmer	House	,	Mr.	O'Brien	looks	up	from	his	plate	after	Mr.	Straszheim	says	something	about	people	who	*T*-1	believe	0	interest	rates	are	about	*-2	to	nosedive	.
``	I	'm	one	of	them	who	*T*-1	hope	0	they	will	*?*	,	with	$	6	billion	*U*	in	debt	on	the	books	.
Is	that	the	forecast	?	''	Mr.	O'Brien	asks	*T*-1	,	*-2	trying	*-3	to	pin	down	the	economist	.
He	does	n't	fully	succeed	,	although	Mr.	Straszheim	lists	an	array	of	interest-rate	scenarios	.
In	a	chilly	conference	room	at	Alliance	Capital	Management	in	Minneapolis	,	in	contrast	,	the	firm	's	money	managers	seem	ready	*-1	to	pin	Mr.	Straszheim	to	the	wall	.
Alfred	Harrison	,	the	manager	,	shoves	Mr.	Straszheim	's	handout	back	at	him	:	``	Do	we	want	*-1	to	go	through	this	?
Or	can	we	ask	you	why	you	changed	your	forecast	just	when	it	's	about	*-1	to	be	right	*T*-2	?	''
*-1	Swiveling	in	his	chair	,	Mr.	Straszheim	replies	that	the	new	outlook	,	though	*-2	still	weak	,	does	n't	justify	*	calling	a	recession	right	now	.	``
It	's	all	in	this	handout	0	you	do	n't	want	*-1	to	look	at	*T*-2	.
We	could	still	have	a	recession	''	at	some	point	.
One	of	Mr.	Straszheim	's	recurring	themes	is	that	the	state	of	the	economy	is	n't	a	simple	black	or	white	.
Sometimes	,	like	now	,	it	's	gray	.
This	somewhat-ambiguous	assessment	moves	one	Alliance	portfolio	manager	to	ask	:	``	So	,	what	*T*-1	is	this	--	a	Stealth	recession	?	''
Another	challenges	Merrill	Lynch	's	bond	recommendation	last	year	.
``	We	're	not	running	that	ad	campaign	any	more	,	''	Mr.	Straszheim	snaps	*T*-1	in	a	rare	show	of	irritation	.
He	adds	,	``	I	think	0	it	was	a	fairly	decent	call	.	''
*-2	Explaining	his	change	of	mind	,	Mr.	Straszheim	says	later	,	``	It	*EXP*-1	's	hard	*	to	pin	this	on	one	factor	.	''
He	says	0	the	economy	,	and	especially	the	employment	numbers	,	look	much	better	than	he	expected	*?*	;	interest	rates	have	generally	declined	;	inflation	has	n't	run	amok	.
``	Our	business	is	constantly	looking	at	all	these	things	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
His	new	forecast	calls	for	``	a	soft	landing	.	''
And	it	may	be	right	,	*	judging	from	last	week	's	report	that	inflation-adjusted	gross	national	product	rose	at	a	2.5	%	annual	rate	in	the	third	quarter	.
Mr.	Shilling	understands	Mr.	Straszheim	's	problems	.
``	There	's	unbelievable	pressure	*ICH*-2	on	economists	*	to	forecast	these	numbers	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.	``
You	make	a	forecast	,	and	then	you	become	its	prisoner	.	''
It	*EXP*-2	is	indeed	hard	*	to	back	away	from	a	widely	publicized	forecast	,	and	Mr.	Straszheim	is	fidgeting	with	the	handcuffs	on	this	trip	.
His	approach	to	the	recantation	is	direct	but	low-key	.
``	For	some	time	,	we	had	forecast	negative	third	-	and	fourth-quarter	growth	.
We	pulled	that	forecast	,	''	he	begins	matter-of-factly	*T*-1	in	a	meeting	with	Piper	,	Jaffray	&	Hopwood	Inc.	officials	in	Minneapolis	,	the	first	stop	.
Crane	Co.	said	0	it	holds	an	8.9	%	stake	in	Milton	Roy	Corp.	,	an	analytical-instruments	maker	,	and	may	seek	control	of	the	company	.
Crane	,	a	maker	of	engineered	products	for	aerospace	,	construction	,	defense	and	other	uses	,	made	the	disclosure	in	a	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	filing	.
In	the	filing	,	Crane	said	that	in	the	past	it	considered	*-3	seeking	control	of	Milton	Roy	,	of	St.	Petersburg	,	Fla.	,	through	a	merger	or	tender	offer	and	that	it	expects	*-1	to	continue	*-2	to	evaluate	an	acquisition	from	time	to	time	.
Crane	officials	did	n't	return	phone	calls	seeking	comment	.
Crane	holds	504,200	Milton	Roy	shares	,	including	254,200	bought	*	from	Sept.	14	to	Thursday	for	$	15.50	to	$	16.75	*U*	each	.
In	New	York	Stock	Exchange	composite	trading	Friday	,	Milton	Roy	shares	leaped	$	2	*U*	,	to	$	18.375	*U*	each	,	while	Crane	sank	$	1.125	*U*	,	to	$	21.125	*U*	a	share	.
John	M.	McNamara	,	chief	financial	officer	of	Milton	Roy	,	said	0	the	company	has	no	comment	on	Crane	's	filing	.
Milton	Roy	recently	fended	off	unsolicited	overtures	from	Thermo	Electron	Corp.	,	a	Waltham	,	Mass.	,	maker	of	biomedical	products	.
Milton	Roy	disclosed	in	May	that	it	was	approached	*-1	for	a	possible	acquisition	by	Thermo	Electron	,	which	*T*-2	agreed	*-3	to	purchase	Milton	Roy	's	liquid-chromatography	line	for	$	22	million	*U*	in	February	.
Thermo	Electron	acquired	some	6	%	of	Milton	Roy	's	common	stock	before	*-1	throwing	in	the	towel	and	reducing	its	stake	in	early	September	.
Gabelli	Group	began	*-1	raising	its	Milton	Roy	stake	in	July	,	and	holds	14.6	%	,	according	to	a	recent	SEC	filing	.
It	has	n't	made	merger	overtures	to	the	board	.
Earlier	this	month	,	Milton	Roy	signed	a	letter	of	intent	*	to	acquire	Automated	Custom	Systems	Inc.	,	Orange	,	Calif.	,	and	its	sister	operation	,	Environmental	Testing	Co.	,	in	Aurora	,	Colo	.
The	companies	are	automotive-emissions-testing	concerns	.
Under	the	terms	,	Milton	Roy	will	pay	an	initial	$	4	million	*U*	for	the	operations	and	additional	payments	during	the	next	four	years	based	*	on	the	earnings	performance	of	the	businesses	.
In	the	nine	months	,	Milton	Roy	earned	$	6.6	million	*U*	,	or	$	1.18	*U*	a	share	,	on	sales	of	$	94.3	million	*U*	.
Last	week	the	British	displayed	unusual	political	immaturity	.
The	Chancellor	of	the	Exchequer	,	Nigel	Lawson	,	resigned	because	Prime	Minister	Thatcher	would	not	fire	her	trusted	adviser	Sir	Alan	Walters	.
The	opposition	Labor	Party	leader	,	Neil	Kinnock	,	in	a	display	of	the	male	chauvinism	typical	of	the	British	lower	class	,	denounced	Mrs.	Thatcher	for	*-2	having	an	independent	mind	and	refusing	*-1	to	heed	the	men	in	her	Cabinet	.
The	British	press	,	*-2	making	a	mountain	out	of	a	molehill	,	precipitated	an	unnecessary	economic	crisis	by	*-2	portraying	Mrs.	Thatcher	as	an	autocrat	who	*T*-1	had	thrown	economic	policy	into	confusion	by	*-3	driving	a	respected	figure	from	her	government	.
Behind	the	silly	posturing	lies	*T*-1	a	real	dispute	.
Mr.	Lawson	and	his	European-minded	colleagues	want	the	British	pound	formally	tied	to	the	West	German	mark	.
Sir	Alan	considers	this	an	ill-advised	and	costly	policy	.
As	there	is	an	effort	*	to	``	anchor	the	dollar	''	either	to	gold	or	other	currencies	,	the	dispute	is	worth	*	examining	*-1	.
Until	his	resignation	,	Mr.	Lawson	had	been	*-2	conducting	British	monetary	policy	as	if	the	pound	were	tied	*-1	to	the	mark	.
When	Mrs.	Thatcher	cut	the	top	tax	rate	to	40	%	*T*-1	,	Mr.	Lawson	flooded	the	country	with	money	*-2	to	prevent	the	pound	from	*-3	rising	against	the	mark	.
As	a	result	,	he	reignited	the	inflation	that	Mrs.	Thatcher	,	through	a	long	and	costly	effort	,	had	subdued	*T*-1	.
With	inflation	surging	,	the	pound	began	*-1	falling	against	the	mark	.
*-2	To	keep	the	exchange	rate	pegged	*-1	,	Mr.	Lawson	tightened	monetary	policy	and	pushed	interest	rates	up	to	15	%	.
This	doubled	the	mortgage	interest	rates	of	the	many	new	homeowners	that	Mrs.	Thatcher	's	policies	had	created	*T*-1	,	*-2	producing	widespread	disaffection	and	pushing	Labor	ahead	in	the	polls	.
Instead	of	*-2	realizing	his	mistake	in	*-3	letting	the	exchange	rate	dominate	both	British	economic	policy	and	Mrs.	Thatcher	's	political	fortune	,	Mr.	Lawson	pushed	for	*	tying	the	pound	formally	to	the	mark	by	*-4	entering	the	European	Monetary	System	,	which	*T*-1	subordinates	all	member	currencies	to	German	monetary	policy	.
This	put	Mrs.	Thatcher	in	a	bind	.
The	concept	of	European	integration	is	one	of	those	grand	schemes	that	*T*-1	appeal	to	intellectuals	,	the	media	and	the	imagination	,	but	are	full	of	practical	pitfalls	.
If	the	pound	had	been	tied	to	the	mark	,	the	British	would	have	been	unable	*-1	to	cut	their	exorbitant	tax	rates	.
The	reason	is	simple	.
When	a	country	cuts	tax	rates	*T*-1	,	it	makes	itself	more	attractive	to	investors	and	drives	up	the	value	of	its	currency	.
It	was	fear	of	*	disturbing	EMS	exchange-rate	relationships	that	*T*-1	caused	the	Chirac	government	in	France	to	be	timid	about	*-2	cutting	tax	rates	.
Edouard	Balladur	,	the	finance	minister	at	the	time	,	was	sold	on	the	tax-cut	policy	but	was	concerned	that	his	government	would	be	criticized	*-1	as	anti-European	for	*-1	disturbing	the	linked	European	currency	relationship	.
The	price	of	*	attracting	capital	--	whether	one	's	own	or	that	of	foreigners	--	is	a	trade	deficit	.
*-1	To	avoid	this	deficit	Mr.	Lawson	inflated	the	pound	in	order	*-1	to	prevent	its	rise	.
This	misguided	policy	could	not	prevent	a	British	trade	deficit	.
Consequently	,	Mr.	Lawson	saddled	Mrs.	Thatcher	with	a	record	trade	deficit	,	renewed	inflation	and	high	interest	rates	--	three	political	failures	in	a	row	.
Little	wonder	that	Mrs.	Thatcher	's	opponents	were	so	anxious	*-1	to	keep	Mr.	Lawson	in	office	.
It	*EXP*-2	is	extraordinary	that	the	British	Treasury	thought	0	it	could	prevent	a	trade	deficit	by	*-1	inflating	the	pound	.
The	British	balance-of-payments	statistics	show	that	after	the	top	tax	rate	was	cut	*-1	to	40	%	,	the	flow	abroad	of	British	capital	slowed	,	to	50	billion	pounds	-LRB-	$	79	billion	*U*	at	the	current	rate	-RRB-	in	1988	from	93	billion	pounds	in	1986	.
This	change	in	the	British	capital	account	required	an	offsetting	change	in	the	trade	account	,	a	change	that	*T*-2	could	not	be	prevented	*-1	by	*	pegging	the	currency	.
Nigel	Lawson	was	a	victim	of	the	immense	confusion	in	thought	that	*T*-1	has	been	characteristic	of	Western	financial	circles	during	the	1980s	.
The	most	important	governments	have	ignored	the	role	of	low	tax	rates	in	*	attracting	real	capital	investment	,	instead	*-1	emphasizing	financial	flows	in	response	to	high	interest	rates	.
This	has	led	them	in	a	fruitless	and	destructive	policy	circle	.
First	comes	*ICH*-4	monetary	expansion	*-2	to	drive	down	the	currency	's	value	that	*T*-3	was	pushed	*-1	up	by	tax-rate	reduction	.
Then	,	when	the	currency	falls	*T*-1	,	interest	rates	are	raised	*-2	*	to	attract	financial	flows	in	order	*-3	to	stabilize	the	exchange	rate	.
This	policy	is	totally	mindless	,	and	Sir	Alan	is	correct	*-1	to	point	out	its	deficiencies	.
Britain	and	all	of	Europe	need	*-1	to	reconsider	the	prospects	for	European	integration	in	light	of	the	possible	reunification	and	neutralization	of	Germany	.
A	unified	Germany	that	*T*-1	remained	within	the	Western	alliance	would	give	Germany	such	an	overshadowing	position	that	all	other	members	of	a	unified	Europe	would	become	vassals	of	the	German	state	.
Unless	the	Soviet	Union	collapses	,	German	reunification	is	likely	*-1	to	require	Germany	's	neutralization	.
The	implications	for	Britain	,	France	and	the	rest	of	Europe	of	*	having	their	currencies	tied	*-1	to	the	economic	policy	of	a	neutral	country	need	considering	before	we	judge	Mr.	Lawson	's	resignation	to	be	unfortunate	.
In	the	least	,	we	must	recognize	the	futility	of	*	trying	*-1	to	use	exchange-rate	intervention	*-2	to	offset	the	effects	of	tax-rate	reduction	on	capital	flows	.
Mr.	Roberts	was	assistant	Treasury	secretary	under	President	Reagan	.
Joseph	P.	Jordan	,	52	years	old	,	becomes	president	*RNR*-1	,	chief	executive	officer	*RNR*-1	and	a	director	*RNR*-1	of	the	bank	company	.
Mr.	Jordan	,	formerly	president	*RNR*-2	and	chief	executive	*RNR*-2	of	Fishkill	National	Bank	in	Beacon	,	N.Y.	,	succeeds	Donald	Broderick	,	who	*T*-1	died	at	52	in	an	automobile	accident	.
Personal	spending	,	which	*T*-1	fueled	the	economy	's	growth	in	the	third	quarter	,	was	clearly	slowing	by	the	end	of	the	period	,	*	raising	questions	about	the	economy	's	strength	as	the	year	ends	.
Personal	spending	grew	0.2	%	in	September	to	a	$	3.526	trillion	*U*	annual	rate	,	the	Commerce	Department	said	0	*T*-1	.
It	was	the	smallest	monthly	increase	in	a	year	.
At	the	same	time	,	personal	income	was	held	*-1	down	by	the	effects	of	Hurricane	Hugo	,	which	*T*-2	tore	through	parts	of	North	and	South	Carolina	in	late	September	.
The	department	said	0	personal	income	rose	0.3	%	in	September	to	a	$	4.469	trillion	*U*	rate	but	would	have	climbed	0.6	%	had	it	not	been	for	the	storm	.
Among	the	economic	effects	of	the	hurricane	was	*T*-1	a	sharp	drop	in	rental	income	.
The	figures	came	a	day	after	the	government	released	a	report	showing	that	consumer	spending	propelled	U.S.	economic	expansion	in	the	third	quarter	while	--	on	an	inflation-adjusted	basis	--	business	investment	slowed	,	government	spending	declined	,	and	exports	were	flat	.
But	the	new	statistics	show	that	by	September	,	the	burst	in	spending	seemed	*-1	to	be	tapering	off	.
Many	economists	expect	the	weakness	to	continue	.
``	I	think	0	the	consumer	has	pretty	well	played	himself	out	,	''	said	*T*-1	David	Littman	,	senior	economist	at	Manufacturers	National	Bank	of	Detroit	.
``	I	do	n't	think	0	there	's	a	lot	in	the	wings	''	in	other	sectors	of	the	economy	0	*T*-1	to	keep	growth	above	1	%	,	he	said	*T*-3	.
In	the	third	quarter	,	the	economy	grew	at	a	moderate	2.5	%	annual	rate	.
In	August	,	personal	income	rose	0.3	%	and	spending	grew	0.9	%	.
Analysts	have	attributed	much	of	the	summer	's	spurt	in	spending	to	bargain	car	prices	at	the	end	of	the	model	year	.
Car	sales	slackened	in	September	after	the	1990	models	were	introduced	*-1	.
According	to	the	Commerce	Department	report	,	spending	on	durable	goods	--	items	expected	*	to	last	at	least	three	years	,	including	cars	--	declined	by	$	6.2	billion	*U*	.
The	nation	's	savings	rate	was	unchanged	in	September	at	4.9	%	of	after-tax	income	,	far	below	the	5.6	%	0	it	reached	*T*-1	in	July	.
All	the	figures	are	adjusted	*-1	for	seasonal	variations	.
Here	is	*T*-1	the	Commerce	Department	's	latest	report	on	personal	income	.
The	figures	are	at	seasonally	adjusted	annual	rates	in	trillions	of	dollars	.
CRA	Ltd.	said	0	it	agreed	*-1	to	sell	a	40	%	stake	in	its	Howick	coal	mine	in	the	state	of	New	South	Wales	to	Mitsubishi	Development	Pty.	of	Japan	.
The	price	was	n't	disclosed	*-1	.
The	agreement	is	subject	to	government	approval	.
RA	acquired	the	Howick	coal	mine	Oct.	20	when	it	bought	British	Petroleum	Co.	's	Australian	coal	interests	for	$	275	million	*U*	*T*-1	.
CRA	said	then	that	it	was	looking	for	a	partner	for	the	mine	,	which	*T*-1	produces	more	than	three	million	metric	tons	of	coal	a	year	.
CRA	is	49%-owned	by	RTZ	Corp.	of	Britain	.
Control	Data	Corp.	,	which	just	months	ago	*T*-1	was	hemorrhaging	financially	,	thinks	0	it	will	be	healthy	enough	*ICH*-2	soon	*-3	to	consider	*-4	repurchasing	public	debt	.
Moreover	,	the	company	,	whose	go-it-alone	approach	*T*-1	nearly	proved	fatal	,	now	sees	alliances	with	others	as	the	way	back	to	prosperity	in	what	it	calls	*T*-2	``	the	data	solutions	''	business	.
``	I	'm	not	saying	0	everything	is	hunky-dory	,	but	we	have	completed	the	transition	,	''	Robert	M.	Price	,	chairman	and	chief	executive	,	said	*T*-1	in	an	interview	.
``	Transition	''	is	a	reference	to	the	company	's	five-year	restructuring	effort	.
During	that	time	,	Control	Data	had	losses	of	more	than	$	1	billion	*U*	.
Now	,	following	asset	sales	that	*T*-1	shrank	revenue	by	more	than	one-third	this	year	alone	,	Control	Data	is	flush	with	cash	.
So	its	senior	executives	are	talking	openly	about	*-1	possibly	buying	back	some	of	the	company	's	$	172.5	million	*U*	in	subordinated	convertible	debentures	next	year	.
``	We	'd	like	*-2	to	continue	*-3	to	reduce	debt	,	''	President	Lawrence	Perlman	said	*T*-1	.
*-1	Noting	that	the	company	is	offering	*-2	to	buy	back	$	154.2	million	*U*	in	senior	notes	paying	12	3\/4	%	,	he	said	0	the	response	will	help	*-3	determine	future	debt-reduction	efforts	.
The	offer	was	automatically	triggered	*-1	by	the	recent	sale	of	Control	Data	's	Imprimis	disk-drive	business	to	Seagate	Technology	Inc	.
Mr.	Perlman	,	who	*T*-1	is	also	acting	chief	financial	officer	and	the	odds-on	favorite	0	*T*-2	to	become	the	next	chief	executive	,	said	0	the	company	is	achieving	``	modest	positive	cash	flow	from	operations	,	and	we	expect	that	to	continue	into	1990	.	''
He	said	0	the	company	has	no	intention	of	*	tapping	its	short-term	bank	lines	``	for	a	good	part	of	1990	.	''
Sometime	next	year	,	Control	Data	will	``	develop	a	new	bank	relationship	,	''	Mr.	Perlman	said	*T*-1	.
In	recent	months	a	group	of	lenders	,	led	*	by	Bank	of	America	,	has	extended	Control	Data	up	to	$	90	million	*U*	in	revolving	loans	through	January	,	as	well	as	$	115	million	*U*	in	standby	letters	of	credit	.
Loan	covenants	require	that	the	company	achieve	specified	levels	of	operating	earnings	and	meet	a	rolling	four-quarter	profitability	test	.
Last	week	Control	Data	reported	third-quarter	earnings	of	$	9.8	million	*U*	,	or	23	cents	a	share	,	on	revenue	of	$	763	million	*U*	.
Through	the	first	nine	months	,	the	company	had	a	loss	of	$	484	million	*U*	,	largely	reflecting	the	closing	of	its	supercomputer	unit	.
While	a	few	assets	*ICH*-1	are	still	being	shopped	*-2	--	including	the	sports	and	entertainment	ticketing	portion	of	the	company	's	Ticketron	unit	--	Mr.	Price	said	0	future	restructuring	would	be	a	question	of	strategy	.
``	We	do	n't	need	the	cash	.	''
Ticketron	's	automated	wagering	business	,	which	*T*-1	operates	lotteries	in	a	half	dozen	states	,	is	not	for	sale	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-2	.
Rather	,	Mr.	Perlman	said	0	*T*-3	,	Control	Data	intends	*-1	to	bid	for	the	coming	Minnesota	lottery	contract	and	is	seeking	new	applications	for	the	technology	overseas	,	where	``	there	is	great	interest	in	games	of	skill	*T*-2	.	''
He	would	n't	elaborate	.
Control	Data	's	semiconductor	business	,	VTC	Inc.	,	continues	*-1	to	lose	money	,	the	executives	acknowledged	0	*T*-2	,	but	they	said	0	they	consider	some	of	the	technology	vital	to	national	defense	and	so	are	reluctant	*-3	to	dispose	of	it	.
The	company	's	strategy	for	*	keeping	its	computer	products	business	profitable	--	it	recently	achieved	profitability	after	several	quarters	of	losses	--	calls	for	a	narrow	focus	and	a	lid	on	expenses	.
Partly	,	costs	will	be	held	*-1	down	through	strategic	technology	alliances	,	management	said	0	*T*-2	.
Control	Data	recently	announced	an	agreement	*ICH*-1	with	MIPS	Computer	Systems	Inc.	*	to	jointly	develop	machines	with	simplified	operating	software	.
James	E.	Ousley	,	computer	products	group	president	,	said	0	such	arrangements	could	help	*-1	slash	Control	Data	's	computer	research	and	development	costs	in	half	by	the	end	of	1990	.
He	disclosed	that	before	Control	Data	scrapped	its	ETA	Systems	Inc.	supercomputer	business	this	past	spring	,	those	costs	were	running	at	nearly	35	%	of	group	revenue	.
At	the	same	time	four	of	six	design	projects	were	spiked	*-1	,	he	said	0	*T*-2	.
*-4	Asked	*-3	how	the	company	hopes	*-1	to	expand	its	computer	hardware	business	*T*-2	,	Mr.	Ousley	said	0	it	sees	good	opportunities	in	systems	integration	.
``	We	think	0	we	're	getting	only	10	%	of	the	integration	dollars	0	our	customers	are	spending	*T*-1	,	''	he	said	*T*-2	.
``	We	're	in	environments	that	*T*-1	are	going	*-2	to	spend	a	lot	of	money	on	that	.	''
Control	Data	mainframes	are	designed	*-1	for	numerically	intensive	computing	users	,	such	as	the	scientific	,	engineering	and	academic	communities	.
Utilities	management	is	a	major	commercial	niche	.
*-1	Reviewing	the	company	's	scrape	with	disaster	,	Mr.	Price	conceded	0	it	had	tried	*-2	to	do	too	much	on	its	own	.
``	Absolutely	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
But	while	its	stock	is	selling	at	about	half	Control	Data	's	estimated	breakup	value	,	neither	Messrs.	Perlman	nor	Price	said	0	he	spends	much	time	*-1	considering	the	possibility	of	a	hostile	takeover	.
``	We	've	been	listed	*-2	as	a	candidate	for	so	long	0	it	's	not	worth	0	*	worrying	about	*T*-3	,	''	said	*T*-1	Mr.	Price	.
Well	,	the	arrogant	East	Coast	media	have	spoken	again	-LRB-	``	*	Going	for	the	Green	,	''	editorial	,	Oct.	17	-RRB-	.
*-1	Having	resided	in	the	great	state	of	California	for	the	past	seven	years	,	I	find	it	*EXP*-3	hard	*	to	ignore	our	environmental	problems	when	I	start	my	commute	to	work	with	eyes	tearing	*RNR*-2	and	head	aching	*RNR*-2	from	the	polluted	air	*T*-4	;	when	I	try	*-6	to	enjoy	the	beaches	and	come	home	*-6	covered	*-8	with	tar	and	oil	*T*-5	;	when	I	hear	of	numerous	deaths	related	*	to	irresponsible	processing	of	cheese	and	use	of	chemicals	in	fruit	growing	*T*-7	.
Perhaps	it	*EXP*-1	's	entertaining	for	those	like	you	*	to	discount	the	concerns	of	environmentalists	,	*-2	suggesting	that	their	save-the-earth	initiatives	are	``	whacky	''	and	referring	to	so	many	citizens	as	``	la-la	activists	.	''
Strange	that	we	do	n't	hear	similar	criticisms	of	the	East	Coast	activists	who	*T*-1	seek	*-2	to	clean	up	Boston	Harbor	or	rid	their	beaches	of	medical	waste	.
While	there	are	no	easy	low-cost	solutions	,	*	simply	ignoring	our	problems	will	result	in	their	severity	increasing	and	spreading	throughout	the	state	,	the	nation	and	the	world	.
If	nothing	else	,	such	initiatives	as	these	will	provide	an	awareness	to	citizens	and	lawmakers	and	encourage	appropriate	corrective	action	.

John	Barry	Ventura	,	Calif	.
I	realize	0	you	were	just	looking	for	something	snotty	0	*	to	say	*T*-1	about	California	and	its	environmental	movement	,	but	*	picking	Frank	Lloyd	Wright	to	say	it	for	you	was	a	bad	call	.
Wright	's	organic	architecture	demonstrated	a	keen	sensitivity	to	the	environment	decades	before	it	became	fashionable	among	``	la-la	activists	.	''
Indeed	,	Wright	said	all	his	life	that	the	greatest	lessons	0	he	learned	*T*-2	were	derived	*-1	from	the	study	of	nature	.
Obviously	,	it	*EXP*-1	's	lost	on	you	that	about	75	%	of	the	American	people	these	days	-LRB-	*ICH*-2	and	in	fact	the	president	of	the	United	States	-RRB-	consider	themselves	environmentalists	.
As	for	California	being	a	state	run	*	by	liberal	environmental	loonies	,	*	let	's	not	forget	where	Ronald	Reagan	came	from	*T*-1	.
Perhaps	Mr.	Reagan	,	who	*T*-2	claimed	that	air	pollution	is	caused	*-1	by	trees	,	is	the	man	0	you	should	be	quoting	*T*-3	*-4	to	back	up	your	position	that	economics	is	more	important	than	the	Earth	.
But	it	was	Frank	Lloyd	Wright	who	*T*-1	said	,	``	Is	this	not	Anti-Christ	?
The	Moloch	that	*T*-1	knows	no	God	but	more	?	''
Robert	Borden	Santa	Monica	,	Calif	.

The	illogic	and	inaccuracy	of	John	H.	Adams	's	comments	for	the	National	Resources	Defense	Council	fully	justifies	your	characterization	of	California	's	Greens	in	particular	as	``	la-la	activists	.	''
We	may	all	hope	that	California	's	voters	will	heed	the	scientific	realities	that	their	own	university	's	renowned	Prof.	Tom	Jukes	provides	them	*T*-1	and	ignore	the	charlatanry	profferred	*	by	their	``	wealthy	Hollywood	weepers	.	''

The	170	airlines	in	the	International	Air	Transport	Association	last	year	posted	group	net	profit	of	$	2.5	billion	*U*	on	revenue	of	$	125.1	billion	*U*	.
According	to	the	association	's	annual	report	,	scheduled	*	to	be	released	*-1	today	in	Warsaw	,	IATA	members	have	n't	posted	such	a	strong	performance	since	the	late	1970s	.
Revenue	last	year	increased	by	more	than	11	%	over	1988	,	and	net	income	nearly	tripled	from	restated	year-earlier	net	of	$	900	million	*U*	.
The	group	attributed	the	strong	results	to	the	favorable	economic	climate	,	rising	demand	for	air	travel	and	improved	average	yield	-LRB-	revenue	received	*	per	ton	of	traffic	transported	*	a	kilometer	-RRB-	.
Systemwide	,	IATA	airlines	carried	632	million	passengers	*ICH*-1	last	year	,	2	%	more	than	in	1987	.
But	passenger-kilometers	,	the	distance	flown	*	while	*	carrying	people	,	increased	5.3	%	in	1988	.

The	KGB	has	abolished	a	unit	known	*	for	*-2	persecuting	dissidents	,	the	government	newspaper	Izvestia	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	newspaper	quoted	KGB	chairman	Vladimir	A.	Kryuchkov	as	*-1	saying	0	the	definition	of	anti-Soviet	crimes	had	narrowed	,	the	laws	had	changed	and	people	no	longer	have	*-2	to	fear	a	simple	slip	of	the	tongue	.
Mr.	Kryuchkov	was	quoted	*-1	as	*-2	saying	that	in	place	of	the	infamous	5th	Directorate	a	new	unit	would	work	``	*-3	to	foil	the	conspiracies	*ICH*-4	of	foreign	intelligence	services	*	to	create	and	use	organized	anti-government	groups	in	our	country	.	''
Czechoslovakia	has	restricted	consumer-goods	exports	to	neighbor	countries	because	of	``	massive	buying	out	of	food	''	by	tourists	from	Poland	,	Hungary	and	the	Soviet	Union	,	the	Rude	Pravo	daily	said	0	*T*-1	.
Rising	inflation	in	Poland	and	Hungary	makes	Czechoslovak	food	,	clothing	and	shoes	relatively	cheap	for	visitors	from	these	countries	.
The	paper	gave	no	details	of	what	the	restrictions	would	entail	*T*-1	but	said	0	the	measures	were	necessary	*	to	protect	the	domestic	market	.

The	European	Community	Commission	has	imposed	provisional	anti-dumping	duties	on	imports	of	South	Korean	small-screen	color-television	sets	.
*-1	Saying	that	a	surge	in	low-priced	imports	had	damaged	EC	producers	'	profits	and	led	to	job	losses	,	the	commission	imposed	a	duty	of	10.2	%	on	TVs	made	*	by	Daewoo	,	a	duty	of	12.3	%	on	Goldstar	Co.	,	13	%	on	Samsung	and	19.6	%	on	TVs	made	*	by	other	South	Korean	producers	.
The	commission	said	that	EC	television	producers	lost	``	important	market	shares	''	and	suffered	an	``	unsustainable	''	pressure	on	prices	because	of	the	Korean	companies	'	marketing	and	pricing	policies	,	which	it	said	0	*T*-1	were	``	in	clear	violation	''	of	international	trade	rules	.
In	other	news	concerning	South	Korea	's	television	industry	,	Samsung	signed	an	agreement	*ICH*-1	with	Soyuz	,	the	external-trade	organization	of	the	Soviet	Union	,	*	to	swap	Korean	television	sets	and	videocassette	recorders	for	pig	iron	from	the	Soviet	Union	.
South	Korea	and	the	Soviet	Union	have	no	diplomatic	relations	but	exchanged	trade	offices	earlier	this	year	.
Sri	Lanka	,	where	more	than	15,000	people	have	died	in	six	years	of	ethnic	turmoil	*T*-1	,	said	0	it	will	ban	sex	and	violence	from	state-owned	television	next	year	.
``	Many	programs	0	we	have	*T*-1	now	come	from	the	West	and	are	not	suitable	to	our	culture	,	''	a	government	minister	said	*T*-2	.

A	poll	of	South	Koreans	showed	overwhelming	opposition	to	efforts	*	to	curb	dog-meat	consumption	just	because	it	offends	foreigners	.
Broad	Inc.	said	0	it	doubled	its	regular	quarterly	dividend	to	five	cents	a	share	from	2.5	cents	on	common	,	and	to	4.5	cents	a	share	2.25	cents	on	Class	B	stock	,	payable	Nov.	10	to	holders	of	record	Nov.	6	.
The	financial	services	company	emerged	from	the	restructuring	of	Kaufman	&	Broad	,	Inc.	,	which	*T*-1	spun	off	its	home-building	subsidiary	into	Kaufman	&	Broad	Home	Corp.	earlier	this	year	and	changed	its	name	to	Broad	Inc	.
For	the	10-month	fiscal	year	ended	Sept.	30	,	Chairman	Eli	Broad	said	0	he	expected	earnings	results	to	approximate	analysts	'	estimates	,	which	the	company	said	0	*T*-1	have	been	revised	*-2	upward	to	80	cents	a	share	.
This	would	compare	with	an	estimated	loss	of	3	cents	a	share	for	the	comparable	10	months	last	year	,	which	*T*-1	included	restructuring	costs	.
If	this	battle	were	a	movie	,	the	producers	would	be	fighting	over	two	scripts	with	nothing	but	an	opening	scene	in	common	.
In	the	opener	,	Sony	Corp.	would	agree	*-1	to	buy	Columbia	Pictures	Entertainment	Inc.	in	a	transaction	valued	*	at	close	to	$	5	billion	*U*	.
Shortly	after	that	,	Sony	would	offer	*-1	to	buy	Guber-Peters	Entertainment	Co.	for	$	200	million	*U*	and	offer	its	co-chairmen	,	Peter	Guber	and	Jon	Peters	,	the	chance	*	to	run	Columbia	.
Mr.	Peters	would	fly	to	New	York	with	the	intention	of	*	telling	Warner	Communications	Inc.	Chairman	Steven	J.	Ross	that	Guber-Peters	planned	*-1	to	end	its	five-year	contract	*	to	produce	movies	exclusively	for	Warner	.
That	's	where	the	two	scripts	would	diverge	*T*-1	.
In	affidavits	filed	*	in	Los	Angeles	Superior	Court	in	connection	with	the	$	1	billion	*U*	breach-of-contract	suit	0	Warner	brought	*T*-1	against	Sony	for	*-2	hiring	the	two	producers	,	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	tell	one	story	.
Warner	tells	another	.
In	the	affidavits	,	Mr.	Peters	says	0	he	was	``	shocked	''	when	Mr.	Ross	refused	a	meeting	and	made	it	*EXP*-2	clear	0	he	would	stop	them	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Peters	claims	0	he	reminded	Mr.	Ross	that	Robert	Daly	and	Terry	Semel	,	the	top	executives	of	the	Warner	Brothers	studio	,	had	``	repeatedly	agreed	that	we	had	every	right	*	to	accept	''	an	offer	such	as	Sony	's	.
In	response	,	Mr.	Peters	says	0	*T*-1	,	Mr.	Ross	referred	to	his	colleagues	at	Warner	with	an	``	obscenity	''	and	said	:	``	*	Tell	them	that	they	do	n't	have	a	job	.
You	can	take	them	with	you	.	''
Warner	denies	0	Mr.	Ross	ever	said	any	such	thing	,	and	,	in	fact	,	denies	virtually	everything	0	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	say	*T*-1	in	their	affidavits	.
Tomorrow	,	Warner	will	file	another	batch	of	documents	contending	that	``	the	essence	of	everything	0	these	guys	are	saying	*T*-1	is	basically	lies	,	''	says	0	*T*-2	Warner	's	chief	outside	counsel	,	Stuart	Rabinowitz	.
Thursday	,	a	judge	is	scheduled	*-1	to	rule	on	Warner	's	motion	seeking	*	to	block	the	Guber-Peters	duo	from	*-2	going	to	Columbia	.
The	battery	of	legal	documents	filed	*	in	the	past	week	in	connection	with	the	suit	provide	a	peek	into	the	inner	workings	of	this	Hollywood	dogfight	.
But	they	also	make	it	*EXP*-1	clear	that	the	first	thing	0	a	judge	will	have	*-2	to	decide	*T*-3	is	which	,	if	any	,	version	of	events	in	this	morass	*T*-4	is	fiction	,	and	which	*T*-5	fact	.
The	matter	may	never	even	be	tried	*-1	in	court	.
Warner	says	that	what	it	really	wants	*T*-2	is	for	the	producers	to	fulfill	their	contractual	obligations	,	but	the	bitterness	of	this	battle	and	the	accusations	flying	on	both	sides	make	it	*EXP*-3	unlikely	that	the	decade-long	relationship	between	Warner	and	its	two	most	prolific	producers	can	ever	be	repaired	*-1	.
Warner	,	which	*T*-1	is	in	the	process	of	*	merging	with	Time	Warner	Inc.	,	says	0	it	is	willing	*-2	to	settle	the	matter	out	of	court	.
So	far	,	however	,	Sony	has	n't	been	willing	*-1	to	meet	its	considerable	financial	demands	.
Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	do	n't	have	much	0	*	to	gain	*T*-1	from	a	protracted	battle	.
Sony	,	for	its	part	,	could	decide	that	the	cost	of	a	Warner	settlement	or	court	fight	is	too	high	,	*-1	choosing	instead	*-2	to	find	someone	else	0	*T*-3	to	run	Columbia	,	although	that	too	would	be	costly	given	the	financial	arrangement	already	guaranteed	*	to	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	.
In	that	case	,	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	might	not	suffer	financially	,	but	they	would	be	left	*-1	without	their	dream	job	of	*	running	a	studio	and	with	a	considerably	scarred	relationship	with	Warner	.
At	the	center	of	any	court	fight	will	be	*T*-1	the	differing	interpretations	of	the	written	contract	between	Warner	and	the	two	producers	,	but	other	murkier	issues	will	play	a	big	role	.
Sony	and	the	Guber-Peters	team	are	hanging	much	of	their	case	on	Warner	's	willingness	*ICH*-2	last	year	*	to	release	the	producers	from	another	contract	and	on	an	oral	agreement	0	they	say	0	*T*-1	allowed	them	to	terminate	the	current	written	contract	if	the	opportunity	*	to	run	a	major	studio	came	up	.
Warner	denies	0	such	an	agreement	was	made	*-1	,	and	disputes	the	Guber-Peters	version	of	virtually	every	telephone	call	and	meeting	0	the	two	sides	had	*T*-2	on	the	matter	.
Just	how	rancorous	the	relationship	has	become	*T*-1	is	clear	from	the	differing	versions	of	the	two	sides	'	current	business	dealings	.
Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	say	in	their	affidavits	that	Warner	already	is	taking	steps	*-1	to	freeze	them	out	of	their	projects	at	Warner	,	notably	the	Sylvester	Stallone	film	``	Tango	and	Cash	.	''
Mr.	Peters	says	in	his	affidavit	that	the	movie	's	staff	was	told	*-1	last	week	that	Warner	was	``	taking	over	''	the	picture	,	and	0	another	producer	would	be	giving	all	of	the	orders	.
Over	his	objections	,	Mr.	Peters	says	0	*T*-3	,	the	film	's	release	date	was	moved	*-1	up	``	by	many	months	''	to	December	,	and	plans	for	a	soundtrack	``	worth	millions	of	dollars	''	were	dropped	*-2	.
Hubert	de	la	Bouillaire	,	an	editor	on	the	film	,	backs	Mr.	Peters	in	a	separate	sworn	declaration	.
Mr.	de	la	Bouillaire	says	0	Warner	Brothers	production	president	Mark	Canton	called	him	Oct.	19	and	said	0	Mr.	Peters	is	``	off	the	picture	.
If	he	calls	you	up	,	*	just	tell	him	0	everything	is	fine	.	''
The	editor	also	says	0	the	new	producer	on	the	film	,	Bruce	Baird	,	told	editors	*-1	to	screen	the	picture	without	*-2	telling	stars	Sylvester	Stallone	and	Kurt	Russell	or	Mr.	Peters	.
``	The	less	they	know	*?*	,	the	easier	it	is	*?*	for	us	.
If	someone	asks	,	*	just	lie	and	tell	them	0	it	will	be	done	*-1	,	''	Mr.	de	la	Bouillaire	says	0	Mr.	Baird	told	them	*T*-2	.
That	,	says	0	*T*-1	Warner	's	Mr.	Rabinowitz	,	is	``	a	total	100	%	lie	.	''
The	movie	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	,	is	in	its	post-production	stages	of	``	*	cleaning	up	the	film	.	''
He	says	0	Mr.	Peters	and	Mr.	Guber	,	as	the	contractual	producers	with	consultation	rights	,	have	been	invited	*-1	to	screenings	and	*-2	to	give	their	input	on	the	film	.
Dozens	of	Guber-Peters	staffers	are	still	working	on	the	Warner	lot	and	consulting	on	various	projects	on	a	``	daily	basis	,	''	the	attorney	says	0	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Guber	,	in	his	affidavit	,	says	that	when	he	advised	Warner	President	Terry	Semel	of	the	Sony	offer	at	lunch	on	Sept.	25	*T*-3	,	Mr.	Semel	``	hugged	and	congratulated	me	,	and	expressed	joy	that	we	had	finally	realized	our	long-term	ambition	of	*	running	*RNR*-1	and	having	an	equity	position	in	*RNR*-1	a	major	entertainment	company	.	''
Mr.	Guber	says	0	he	brought	to	lunch	a	release	document	0	Warner	had	agreed	to	*T*-1	in	1988	,	when	he	and	Mr.	Peters	made	an	aborted	bid	*	to	buy	part	of	MGM\/UA	Entertainment	Co.	*-2	to	run	the	MGM	studio	*T*-3	.
Mr.	Guber	says	0	he	had	crossed	out	``	MGM	''	with	a	red	pen	and	written	in	``	Columbia	,	''	*-1	giving	the	document	to	Mr.	Semel	.
``	Mr.	Semel	said	absolutely	nothing	0	*T*-2	to	indicate	0	Warner	would	have	any	objection	to	our	assuming	management	positions	at	Columbia	,	''	Mr.	Guber	says	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Semel	,	in	his	affidavit	,	does	n't	mention	any	hugging	or	congratulating	.
He	says	0	he	told	Mr.	Guber	0	he	could	n't	sign	any	documents	and	that	``	the	deal	,	although	*-1	apparently	a	good	one	for	him	and	Mr.	Peters	,	would	have	a	very	negative	impact	on	Warner	.	''
He	said	0	he	would	contact	Mr.	Ross	and	Warner	Brothers	Chairman	Robert	Daly	and	that	,	in	a	conference	call	,	the	three	agreed	0	they	could	n't	let	the	producers	out	of	their	contract	.
Mr.	Ross	,	in	his	own	affidavit	,	says	0	he	and	Mr.	Daly	instructed	Mr.	Semel	*-1	to	tell	the	producers	0	Warner	would	n't	terminate	their	agreement	.
Mr.	Guber	says	that	Mr.	Semel	did	convey	that	information	and	that	Mr.	Semel	said	0	Mr.	Ross	was	``	crazy	because	of	the	Time	deal	,	''	*-3	meaning	,	Mr.	Guber	says	*T*-2	,	that	Mr.	Ross	``	did	not	want	*-1	to	communicate	to	his	new	merger	partner	,	Time	Inc.	,	that	Warner	's	agreements	provided	for	our	departure	under	these	circumstances	.	''
Mr.	Guber	also	says	in	his	affidavit	that	Mr.	Daly	``	told	us	that	even	if	Sony	did	not	want	us	,	Warner	's	relationship	with	us	already	was	irreparably	damaged	*-1	,	that	there	was	no	way	`	0	*	to	put	the	egg	together	*T*-2	,	'	and	that	it	would	sue	Sony	for	tons	of	money	.	''
Moreover	,	Mr.	Guber	claims	0	*T*-1	,	Mr.	Semel	told	him	that	Mr.	Ross	probably	would	n't	object	``	if	it	were	anybody	other	than	Sony	.
But	Sony	is	a	problem	.	''
The	Guber-Peters	side	has	said	0	Warner	is	particularly	concerned	about	the	prospect	of	a	huge	Japanese	company	controlling	important	segments	of	the	U.S.	entertainment	business	.
Some	in	Hollywood	suggest	0	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	took	encouragement	from	Warner	studio	executives	such	as	Mr.	Semel	and	Mr.	Canton	too	literally	.
According	to	this	theory	,	Warner	executives	,	*-2	hoping	*-1	to	strengthen	their	relationships	with	the	producers	,	encouraged	Mr.	Guber	and	Mr.	Peters	in	their	ambitions	*	to	build	a	major	entertainment	company	.
But	the	Warner	executives	in	their	affidavits	deny	*-1	ever	telling	the	producers	0	they	could	get	out	of	their	written	contract	.
Mr.	Rabinowitz	,	the	Warner	attorney	,	says	0	the	studio	still	wants	the	producers	to	come	back	and	fulfill	their	contract	.
``	They	are	like	a	mini-studio	;	they	have	50	projects	*ICH*-1	in	development	for	Warner	,	''	he	says	*T*-2	.
But	Mr.	Guber	indicates	in	his	affidavit	that	not	all	of	the	projects	will	be	used	*-1	.
For	example	,	he	says	that	since	1985	,	he	and	Mr.	Peters	have	developed	over	85	movie	projects	,	and	Warner	has	``	passed	*RNR*-1	''	or	chosen	*	not	to	produce	*RNR*-1	at	least	76	.
As	for	the	projects	remaining	at	Warner	,	Mr.	Guber	says	0	*T*-1	,	``	Mr.	Semel	informed	me	that	Warner	's	producers	have	already	started	a	`	feeding	frenzy	'	for	our	projects	.
E.W.	Scripps	Co.	said	0	it	has	acquired	a	Georgia	cable	television	company	and	a	Massachusetts	publishing	firm	.
Terms	on	both	deals	were	n't	disclosed	*-1	.
The	media	company	said	0	it	purchased	Cable	USA	Inc.	,	a	privately	held	cable	television	system	in	Carroll	County	,	Ga.	,	a	suburb	of	Atlanta	.
The	system	is	still	under	construction	and	will	serve	a	market	of	7,600	homes	.
The	company	also	has	acquired	Sundance	Publishers	and	Distributors	Inc.	,	a	family	owned	producer	and	distributor	of	educational	materials	in	Littleton	,	Mass	.
Despite	politicians	'	hand-wringing	about	the	federal	budget	,	the	government	ended	fiscal	1989	with	a	$	152.08	billion	*U*	deficit	,	about	the	same	as	the	two	previous	years	.
Even	White	House	budget	director	Richard	Darman	had	trouble	*	finding	a	silver	lining	in	the	report	.
``	I	suppose	0	you	could	say	0	the	good	news	is	that	the	deficits	are	not	heading	up	,	''	he	said	*T*-2	,	``	but	you	ca	n't	be	satisfied	*-1	with	deficits	at	this	level	and	we	're	not	*?*	.	''
The	federal	deficit	was	$	155.15	billion	*U*	in	1988	and	$	149.69	billion	*U*	in	1987	.
The	1989	deficit	would	have	been	nearly	$	10	billion	*U*	larger	had	the	government	been	able	*-1	to	spend	as	much	as	Congress	intended	*?*	on	*-2	cleaning	up	the	thrift	industry	before	the	year	ended	on	Sept.	30	.
Because	the	Resolution	Trust	Corp	.	could	n't	spend	the	money	fast	enough	,	the	savings-and-loan	outlays	were	pushed	*-1	into	fiscal	1990	.
Nevertheless	,	the	1989	deficit	still	exceeded	the	$	136	billion	*U*	target	set	*	by	the	Gramm-Rudman	deficit-reduction	law	by	$	16	billion	*U*	,	a	reminder	of	that	law	's	shortcomings	.
The	law	sets	a	deficit	target	of	$	100	billion	*U*	for	fiscal	1990	.
A	partisan	fight	over	*	cutting	capital-gains	taxes	has	slowed	the	progress	of	1990	deficit-reduction	legislation	almost	to	a	halt	,	*-1	triggering	across-the-board	spending	cuts	under	the	Gramm-Rudman	law	.
The	White	House	and	the	Democratic	leadership	in	Congress	blame	each	other	for	*-1	turning	capital-gains	taxes	into	such	a	divisive	issue	this	year	.
Neither	side	showed	any	sign	of	*	retreating	.
*-2	Meeting	with	reporters	Friday	,	Mr.	Darman	again	said	0	he	would	rather	live	with	across-the-board	spending	cuts	than	accept	a	deficit-reduction	bill	like	the	one	passed	*	by	the	House	,	which	*T*-1	would	increase	spending	in	future	years	.
*-1	Underscoring	the	size	of	the	deficits	of	the	past	few	years	,	the	Treasury	report	showed	that	for	the	first	time	interest	paid	*	on	the	public	debt	--	$	240.86	billion	*U*	--	exceeded	spending	on	Social	Security	,	the	single	largest	government	program	.
In	all	,	federal	outlays	amounted	to	$	1.143	trillion	*U*	in	1989	,	up	7.5	%	from	the	previous	year	,	the	Treasury	said	0	*T*-1	.
Federal	revenues	rose	9	%	to	$	990.79	billion	*U*	.
The	Treasury	said	0	a	surge	in	tax	receipts	noted	*	earlier	in	the	year	did	n't	turn	out	*-1	to	be	quite	as	strong	as	it	first	appeared	*?*	.
The	Treasury	marked	up	its	forecast	by	$	17	million	*U*	in	July	,	but	that	proved	*-1	to	be	about	$	5	billion	*U*	too	optimistic	.
The	government	ran	a	deficit	of	$	6.16	billion	*U*	in	September	,	compared	with	a	surplus	of	$	10.17	billion	*U*	in	September	1988	.
Outlays	for	the	month	totaled	$	105.39	billion	*U*	,	up	from	$	87.57	billion	*U*	a	year	earlier	.
The	increase	reflects	spending	on	the	S&L	rescue	as	well	as	payroll	and	Social	Security	checks	normally	issued	*	in	October	that	*T*-2	were	issued	*-1	in	September	this	year	because	Oct.	1	fell	on	a	Sunday	.
Revenues	were	$	99.23	billion	*U*	,	up	from	$	97.74	billion	*U*	a	year	earlier	.
CMS	Energy	Corp.	said	0	it	would	begin	*-1	paying	a	10-cent-a-share	quarterly	dividend	,	the	company	's	first	since	1984	.
Consumers	Power	Co.	,	now	the	main	unit	of	CMS	Energy	,	ran	into	financial	problems	over	its	$	4.2	billion	*U*	Midland	nuclear	plant	,	which	*T*-2	was	abandoned	*-1	as	a	nuclear	facility	in	1984	because	of	construction	delays	and	high	costs	.
CMS	is	nearly	done	*-1	converting	the	Midland	plant	to	a	gas-fired	cogeneration	facility	at	a	cost	of	$	600	million	*U*	.
CMS	management	said	Thursday	that	they	planned	*-1	to	recommend	*-3	paying	a	modest	dividend	when	the	board	of	directors	met	Friday	*T*-2	.
The	dividend	will	be	paid	*-1	Nov.	22	to	shares	of	record	Nov.	7	.
The	company	suffered	a	loss	of	$	270	million	*U*	in	1985	,	but	its	financial	situation	has	been	improving	since	then	.
Humana	Inc.	said	0	it	expects	*-1	to	receive	about	$	27	million	*U*	in	federal	income-tax	refunds	and	interest	from	a	court	ruling	on	a	tax	dispute	.
The	health-care	company	said	0	it	expects	the	refund	to	be	included	*-1	in	the	first	quarter	ending	Nov.	30	.
The	refund	is	about	$	9	million	*U*	.
Accrued	interest	on	the	refund	was	about	$	18	million	*U*	as	of	Oct.	25	.
The	refund	stems	from	a	court	ruling	that	*T*-1	found	0	certain	payments	by	Humana	subsidiaries	to	its	insurance	subsidiary	during	fiscal	1977	through	1979	were	deductible	as	premiums	for	liability	insurance	.
Polly	Peck	International	Inc.	's	agreement	*	to	acquire	51	%	of	Sansui	Electric	Co.	proves	that	foreign	companies	can	acquire	Japanese	companies	--	if	the	alternative	for	the	Japanese	company	is	extinction	.
Polly	Peck	,	a	fast-growing	British	conglomerate	,	will	pay	15.6	billion	yen	-LRB-	$	110	million	*U*	-RRB-	for	39	million	new	shares	of	Sansui	,	a	well-known	maker	of	high-fidelity	audio	equipment	that	*T*-1	failed	*-2	to	adjust	to	changing	market	conditions	.
Japanese	government	officials	,	*-1	eager	*-2	to	rebut	foreign	criticism	of	Japanese	investments	overseas	,	hailed	the	transaction	as	proof	0	foreigners	can	make	similar	investments	in	Japan	.
Polly	Peck	's	chairman	,	Asil	Nadir	,	echoed	the	official	Japanese	view	of	the	accord	,	which	*T*-2	was	announced	*-1	Friday	.
``	The	myths	that	Japan	is	not	open	to	concerns	from	outside	has	,	I	think	0	*T*-1	,	been	demolished	at	a	stroke	,	''	Mr.	Nadir	said	*T*-1	.
But	analysts	say	0	Sansui	is	a	special	case	.
It	expects	*-1	to	post	a	loss	of	6.4	billion	yen	for	the	year	ending	tomorrow	and	its	liabilities	currently	exceed	its	assets	by	about	13.8	billion	yen	.	``
If	you	find	sound	,	healthy	companies	in	Japan	,	they	are	not	for	sale	,	''	said	*T*-1	George	Watanabe	,	a	management-consultant	at	Tokyo-based	Asia	Advisory	Services	Inc	.
Statistics	on	acquisitions	by	foreigners	vary	in	detail	,	because	unlike	Sansui	,	which	*T*-2	is	listed	*-1	on	the	Tokyo	and	Osaka	stock	exchanges	,	most	of	the	Japanese	companies	acquired	*	by	foreigners	are	privately	held	*-3	.
But	by	all	accounts	foreign	companies	have	bought	only	a	relative	handful	of	Japanese	companies	this	year	,	while	Japanese	companies	have	acquired	hundreds	of	foreign	companies	.
Nor	do	analysts	expect	the	Sansui	deal	to	touch	off	a	fresh	wave	of	foreign	purchases	.
If	the	strong	yen	and	the	high	stock	prices	of	Japanese	companies	were	n't	deterrents	enough	,	webs	of	cross-shareholdings	between	friendly	Japanese	companies	and	fiercely	independent	Japanese	corporate	attitudes	repel	most	would-be	acquirers	.
Usually	when	a	Japanese	company	is	ready	*-2	to	sell	*T*-1	,	it	has	few	alternatives	remaining	,	and	the	grim	demeanors	of	Sansui	's	directors	at	a	joint	news	conference	here	left	little	doubt	that	this	was	not	the	company	's	finest	hour	.
Sansui	was	once	one	of	Japan	's	premier	makers	of	expensive	,	high-quality	stereo	gear	for	audiophiles	.
But	in	recent	years	,	the	market	has	moved	toward	less	expensive	``	mini-component	''	sets	,	miniaturized	amplifiers	and	receivers	and	software	players	that	*T*-2	could	be	stacked	*-1	on	top	of	each	other	.
Some	of	Sansui	's	fellow	audio-specialty	companies	,	such	as	Aiwa	Co.	and	Pioneer	Electric	Corp.	,	responded	to	the	challenge	by	*-1	quickly	bringing	out	mini-component	products	of	their	own	,	by	*-1	moving	heavily	into	the	booming	compact	disk	businesses	or	by	*-1	diversifying	into	other	consumer-electronics	fields	,	including	laser	disks	or	portable	cassette	players	.
Sansui	was	late	into	the	mini-component	business	and	failed	*-1	to	branch	into	other	new	businesses	.
As	the	yen	soared	in	recent	years	,	Sansui	's	deepening	financial	problems	became	a	vicious	circle	.
While	competitors	moved	production	offshore	in	response	to	the	sagging	competitiveness	of	Japanese	factories	,	Sansui	lacked	the	money	0	*	to	build	new	plants	*T*-1	in	Southeast	Asia	.
``	Our	company	has	not	been	able	*-1	to	cope	very	effectively	with	''	changes	in	the	marketplace	,	said	*T*-2	Ryosuke	Ito	,	Sansui	's	president	.
But	even	a	Japanese	company	that	*T*-1	looks	like	a	dog	may	turn	out	*-3	to	be	a	good	investment	for	a	foreign	concern	,	some	management	consultants	maintain	0	*T*-2	.
Yoshihisa	Murasawa	,	a	management	consultant	for	Booz-Allen	&	Hamilton	-LRB-	Japan	-RRB-	Inc.	,	said	0	his	firm	will	likely	be	recommending	acquisitions	of	Japanese	companies	more	often	to	foreign	clients	in	the	future	.
``	Attitudes	-LCB-	toward	*	being	acquired	*-1	-RCB-	are	still	negative	,	but	they	're	becoming	more	positive	,	''	Mr.	Murasawa	said	*T*-2	.
``	In	some	industries	,	like	pharmaceuticals	,	acquisitions	make	sense	.	''
Whether	Polly	Peck	's	acquisition	makes	sense	remains	*-2	to	be	seen	*-1	,	but	at	the	news	conference	,	Mr.	Nadir	brimmed	with	self-confidence	that	he	can	turn	Sansui	around	.
Sansui	,	he	said	0	*T*-2	,	is	a	perfect	fit	for	Polly	Peck	's	electronics	operations	,	which	*T*-1	make	televisions	,	videocassette	recorders	,	microwaves	and	other	products	on	an	``	original	equipment	maker	''	basis	for	sale	under	other	companies	'	brand	names	.
He	said	0	Polly	Peck	will	greatly	expand	Sansui	's	product	line	,	*-2	using	Sansui	's	engineers	*-1	to	design	the	new	products	,	and	will	move	Sansui	's	production	of	most	products	other	than	sophisticated	audio	gear	offshore	into	Polly	Peck	's	own	factories	.
``	Whatever	capital	it	-LRB-	Sansui	-RRB-	needs	*T*-2	so	it	can	compete	and	become	a	totally	global	entity	capable	of	*	competing	with	the	best	in	the	world	,	that	capital	will	be	injected	*-1	,	''	Mr.	Nadir	said	*T*-3	.
And	while	Polly	Peck	is	n't	jettisoning	the	existent	top-management	structure	of	Sansui	,	it	is	bringing	in	a	former	Toshiba	Corp.	executive	as	executive	vice	president	and	chief	operating	officer	.
Such	risk	taking	is	an	everyday	matter	for	the	brash	Mr.	Nadir	,	who	*T*-1	is	25	%	owner	of	Polly	Peck	as	well	as	its	chairman	.
He	took	Polly	Peck	,	once	a	small	fabric	wholesaler	,	and	used	it	at	as	a	base	0	*	to	build	a	conglomerate	that	*T*-1	has	been	doubling	its	profits	annually	since	1980	*T*-2	.
In	September	,	it	announced	plans	*	to	acquire	the	tropical-fruit	business	of	RJR	Nabisco	Inc.	's	Del	Monte	foods	unit	for	#	557	million	*U*	-LRB-	$	878	million	*U*	-RRB-	.
Last	month	,	Polly	Peck	posted	a	38	%	jump	in	pretax	profit	for	the	first	half	to	#	54.8	million	*U*	from	#	39.8	million	*U*	on	a	63	%	rise	in	sales	.
Joann	S.	Lublin	in	London	contributed	to	this	article	.
The	bolstered	cellular	agreement	between	BellSouth	Corp.	and	LIN	Broadcasting	Corp.	carries	heightened	risks	and	could	fail	*-1	to	fend	off	McCaw	Cellular	Communications	Inc.	,	the	rival	suitor	for	LIN	.
Moreover	,	the	amended	pact	shows	how	McCaw	's	persistence	has	pushed	LIN	and	BellSouth	into	a	corner	*T*-1	,	*-2	forcing	huge	debt	on	the	proposed	new	company	.
The	debt	,	estimated	*	at	$	4.7	billion	*U*	,	could	mortgage	the	cellular	company	's	future	earning	power	in	order	*-1	to	placate	some	LIN	holders	in	the	short	term	.
The	plan	still	calls	for	LIN	to	combine	its	cellular	telephone	properties	with	BellSouth	's	and	to	spin	off	its	broadcasting	operations	.
But	under	new	terms	of	the	agreement	,	announced	*	Friday	,	LIN	holders	would	receive	a	special	cash	dividend	of	$	42	*U*	a	share	,	representing	a	payout	of	about	$	2.23	billion	*U*	,	shortly	before	the	proposed	merger	.
LIN	said	0	it	expects	*-2	to	borrow	the	money	0	*	to	pay	the	dividend	*T*-3	,	but	commitments	from	banks	still	have	n't	been	obtained	*-1	.
Under	previous	terms	,	holders	would	have	received	a	dividend	of	only	$	20	*U*	a	share	.
In	addition	,	New	York-based	LIN	would	exercise	its	right	*	to	buy	out	for	$	1.9	billion	*U*	the	55	%	equity	interest	of	its	partner	,	Metromedia	Co.	,	in	a	New	York	cellular	franchise	.
That	money	also	would	have	*-2	to	be	borrowed	*-1	.
In	effect	,	McCaw	has	forced	LIN	's	hand	by	*-1	bidding	$	1.9	billion	*U*	for	the	stake	earlier	this	month	.
``	We	're	taking	on	more	debt	than	we	would	have	liked	*-2	to	*?*	,	''	acknowledged	*T*-1	Michael	Plouf	,	LIN	's	vice	president	and	treasurer	.
Although	he	expressed	confidence	that	the	proposed	new	company	's	cash	flow	would	be	sufficient	*-1	to	cover	interest	payments	on	the	debt	,	he	estimated	that	the	company	would	n't	be	profitable	until	1994	or	later	.
Analyst	estimate	the	value	of	the	BellSouth	proposal	at	about	$	115	to	$	125	*U*	a	share	.
They	value	McCaw	's	bid	at	$	112	to	$	118	*U*	a	share	.
The	previous	BellSouth	pact	was	valued	*-1	at	about	$	98	to	$	110	*U*	a	share	.
McCaw	,	the	largest	provider	of	cellular	telephone	service	in	the	U.S.	,	already	owns	about	9.4	%	of	LIN	's	stock	.
In	response	to	BellSouth	's	amended	pact	,	the	Kirkland	,	Wash.	,	company	extended	its	own	offer	*	to	buy	22	million	LIN	shares	for	$	125	*U*	apiece	,	which	*T*-1	would	give	McCaw	a	50.3	%	controlling	interest	.
Over	the	weekend	,	McCaw	continued	*-1	to	call	for	an	auction	of	LIN	.
Analysts	said	0	they	expect	McCaw	to	escalate	the	bidding	again	.
``	This	game	is	n't	over	yet	,	''	said	*T*-1	Joel	D.	Gross	,	a	vice	president	at	Donaldson	,	Lufkin	&	Jenrette	Securities	Corp	.
``	At	some	point	,	it	will	become	non-economical	for	one	company	.
But	I	do	n't	think	0	we	're	at	that	point	yet	.	''
Under	its	revised	proposal	,	Atlanta-based	BellSouth	would	have	a	50	%	interest	in	the	new	cellular	company	and	would	be	responsible	for	half	of	its	debt	.
*-1	To	sweeten	the	pact	further	--	and	to	ease	concerns	of	institutional	investors	--	BellSouth	added	a	provision	designed	*	*-3	to	give	extra	protection	to	holders	if	the	regional	Bell	company	ever	decides	*-2	to	buy	the	rest	of	the	new	cellular	company	.
The	provision	,	described	*	as	``	back-end	''	protection	,	would	require	BellSouth	to	pay	a	price	equivalent	to	what	an	outside	party	might	have	*-2	to	pay	*T*-1	.
McCaw	's	bid	also	has	a	similar	clause	.
Only	McCaw	's	proposal	requires	the	company	to	begin	an	auction	process	in	June	1994	for	remaining	shares	at	third-party	prices	.
*-1	To	mollify	shareholders	concerned	*	about	the	long-term	value	of	the	company	under	the	BellSouth-LIN	agreement	,	BellSouth	also	agreed	*-1	to	pay	as	much	as	$	10	*U*	a	share	,	or	$	540	million	*U*	,	if	,	after	five	years	,	the	trading	value	of	the	new	cellular	company	is	n't	as	high	as	the	value	that	shareholders	would	have	realized	*T*-2	from	the	McCaw	offer	.
``	We	're	very	pleased	with	the	new	deal	.
We	did	n't	expect	BellSouth	to	be	so	responsive	,	''	said	*T*-2	Frederick	A.	Moran	,	president	of	Moran	Asset	Management	Inc.	,	which	*T*-1	holds	500,000	LIN	shares	.
BellSouth	's	``	back-end	protection	was	flawed	*-1	previously	.
We	think	0	this	is	a	superior	deal	to	McCaw	's	.
We	're	surprised	.
We	did	n't	think	0	a	sleeping	-LCB-	Bell	-RCB-	mentality	would	be	willing	*-1	to	take	on	dilution	.	''
But	Kenneth	Leon	,	a	telecommunications	analyst	with	Bear	,	Stearns	&	Co.	,	finds	the	BellSouth	proposal	still	flawed	*-4	because	the	company	does	n't	have	*-1	to	wait	five	years	*-2	to	begin	*-3	buying	more	LIN	shares	.
``	How	many	shares	*T*-1	will	be	around	in	1995	?	''	he	asked	*T*-2	.
``	There	's	nothing	preventing	BellSouth	from	*-1	buying	up	shares	in	the	meanwhile	.	''
BellSouth	's	revised	proposal	surprised	many	industry	analysts	,	especially	because	of	the	company	's	willingness	*	to	accept	some	dilution	of	future	earnings	.
William	O.	McCoy	,	president	of	the	company	's	BellSouth	Enterprises	Inc.	unit	,	said	0	the	revised	agreement	with	LIN	would	dilute	BellSouth	earnings	by	about	9	%	in	both	1990	and	1991	and	by	significantly	less	thereafter	.
Indeed	,	BellSouth	's	cellular	operations	were	among	the	first	in	the	country	0	*T*-1	to	become	profitable	.
For	1988	,	BellSouth	earned	$	1.7	billion	*U*	,	or	$	3.51	*U*	a	share	,	on	revenue	of	$	13.6	billion	*U*	.
Analysts	were	predicting	1990	BellSouth	earnings	in	the	range	of	$	3.90	*U*	a	share	,	or	$	1.9	billion	*U*	,	but	now	those	estimates	are	being	scaled	*-1	back	.
In	composite	trading	Friday	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	,	BellSouth	shares	fell	87.5	cents	to	$	52.125	*U*	.
In	national	over-the-counter	trading	,	LIN	shares	soared	$	4.625	*U*	*-1	to	closed	at	$	112.625	*U*	,	while	McCaw	fell	$	2.50	*U*	a	share	to	$	37.75	*U*	.
The	proposed	BellSouth-LIN	cellular	company	,	including	the	newly	acquired	Metromedia	stake	,	would	give	the	new	entity	55	million	potential	customers	,	including	about	35	million	in	the	nation	's	top	10	markets	.

Market	makers	in	Nasdaq	over-the-counter	stocks	are	adding	their	voices	to	the	swelling	chorus	of	complaints	about	program	trading	.
Their	motivation	,	however	,	has	a	strong	practical	aspect	:	Program	trading	is	hazardous	to	their	paychecks	.
The	most	controversial	form	of	program	trading	,	stock-index	arbitrage	,	is	``	making	it	*EXP*-1	tough	for	traders	to	make	money	,	''	declares	*T*-2	Robert	Antolini	,	head	of	OTC	trading	at	Donaldson	,	Lufkin	&	Jenrette	.
Stock-index	arbitrage	--	the	computer-guided	buying	and	selling	of	stocks	with	offsetting	trades	in	stock-index	futures	0	*T*-1	to	profit	from	fleeting	price	discrepancies	--	affects	the	OTC	market	directly	through	the	31	stocks	included	*	in	Standard	&	Poor	's	500-stock	index	.
The	S&P	500	is	often	used	in	arbitrage	strategies	.
The	portion	of	OTC	volume	attributable	to	program	trading	is	n't	known	*-1	,	as	it	is	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	,	where	it	amounted	to	more	than	13	%	in	September	*T*-2	.
Estimates	from	traders	put	it	at	less	than	5	%	of	Nasdaq	's	average	daily	volume	of	roughly	133	million	shares	.
Other	market-maker	gripes	:	Program	trading	also	causes	the	Nasdaq	Composite	Index	to	lose	ground	against	other	segments	of	the	stock	market	.
Because	of	program	trading	it	*EXP*-1	is	more	difficult	*	to	trade	many	OTC	stocks	without	sharp	price	moves	,	a	condition	known	*	as	illiquidity	.
Moreover	,	the	price	volatility	that	*T*-3	is	amplified	*-1	by	program	trading	is	undercutting	efforts	*	to	woo	individual	investors	back	to	an	OTC	market	that	*T*-2	sorely	misses	them	.
Some	of	these	problems	are	neither	new	nor	unique	to	the	OTC	market	.
But	the	big	,	often	tumultuous	slide	in	stock	prices	this	month	has	turned	some	of	those	who	*T*-1	have	been	profiting	from	the	practice	against	it	.
Peter	DaPuzzo	,	head	of	retail	equity	trading	at	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	,	acknowledges	that	he	was	n't	troubled	*-1	by	program	trading	when	it	began	in	the	pre-crash	bull	market	*T*-2	because	it	added	liquidity	and	people	were	pleased	*-3	to	see	stock	prices	rising	.
``	We	were	n't	as	concerned	until	they	became	sell	programs	,	''	says	*T*-2	Mr.	DaPuzzo	,	who	*T*-1	now	thinks	0	it	adds	unnecessary	volatility	.
Shearson	Lehman	,	however	,	executes	program	trades	for	clients	.
Merrill	Lynch	,	Goldman	Sachs	and	Kidder	Peabody	,	in	addition	to	Shearson	,	do	program-trade	OTC	stocks	.
Shearson	,	Merrill	Lynch	and	Goldman	Sachs	say	0	they	do	so	only	for	customers	,	however	.
Kidder	Peabody	does	program	trading	for	its	own	*RNR*-1	as	well	as	clients	'	*RNR*-1	accounts	.
Of	course	,	there	were	sell	programs	in	past	years	,	too	,	but	they	seem	*-1	to	hurt	market	makers	more	painfully	these	days	.
That	's	largely	because	of	defensive	measures	0	they	adopted	*T*-1	after	the	1987	crash	,	when	individual	investors	fled	the	market	*T*-2	and	trading	activity	dwindled	*T*-2	.
Market	makers	,	*-2	to	cut	costs	,	slashed	inventories	of	stocks	0	they	keep	*T*-1	on	hand	0	*	to	sell	investors	*T*-6	when	other	holders	are	n't	selling	*T*-3	.
And	*-2	to	protect	their	reduced	capital	investment	from	*-4	eroding	further	,	market	makers	became	quicker	*-2	to	lower	price	quotes	when	sell	programs	are	in	progress	*T*-3	.
On	days	when	prices	are	tumbling	*T*-1	,	they	must	be	willing	*-2	to	buy	shares	from	sellers	when	no	one	else	will	*T*-3	.
In	such	an	environment	,	market	makers	can	suffer	huge	losses	both	on	trades	made	*	that	day	at	steadily	dropping	prices	and	in	the	value	of	their	inventories	of	shares	.
``	It	*EXP*-2	makes	no	sense	for	us	to	put	money	at	risk	when	you	know	0	you	're	going	*-4	to	lose	*T*-3	,	''	says	*T*-1	Mr.	Antolini	,	of	Donaldson	Lufkin	.
But	this	skittishness	,	Mr.	Antolini	says	0	*T*-1	,	is	creating	liquidity	problems	in	certain	OTC	stocks	.
``	It	*EXP*-1	's	harder	*	to	sell	stocks	when	the	sell	programs	come	in	*T*-3	because	some	market	makers	do	n't	want	*-2	to	-LCB-	take	the	orders	-RCB-	.
No	one	has	big	positions	and	no	one	wants	*-1	to	take	big	risks	.	''
Joseph	Hardiman	,	president	of	the	National	Association	of	Securities	Dealers	,	which	*T*-1	oversees	trading	on	Nasdaq	,	agrees	that	program	trading	is	hurting	the	market	's	efforts	*	to	bring	back	small	investors	.
But	,	he	observes	0	*T*-2	,	while	makers	suffer	losses	when	program	trading	drags	the	market	down	*T*-1	,	they	also	make	money	when	program	trading	pushes	the	prices	higher	*T*-3	.
``	Sometimes	-LCB-	traders	-RCB-	lose	sight	of	that	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
The	OTC	stocks	in	the	S&P	500	include	Nasdaq	's	biggest	,	such	as	Apple	Computer	,	MCI	Communications	,	Tele-Communications	and	Liz	Claiborne	.
These	big	stocks	greatly	influence	the	Nasdaq	Composite	Index	.
When	the	computers	say	``	*	sell	*T*-2	,	''	the	composite	*ICH*-1	tumbles	as	well	as	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	.
The	problem	,	market	makers	say	0	*T*-2	,	is	that	while	the	industrial	average	and	the	S&P	500	usually	recover	as	buy	programs	kick	in	,	the	Nasdaq	Composite	frequently	is	left	*-1	behind	.
Eight	trading	days	after	Oct.	12	,	the	day	before	the	stock	market	plunge	,	for	instance	,	the	Nasdaq	Composite	had	fallen	4.3	%	,	compared	with	3.3	%	for	the	S&P	500	,	3.5	%	for	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	Composite	Index	and	3.6	%	for	the	industrial	average	.
This	gap	eventually	closes	,	but	slowly	.
Three	days	later	,	as	of	Friday	's	close	,	the	Nasdaq	Composite	was	down	6	%	,	compared	with	5.9	%	for	the	industrial	average	,	5.7	%	for	the	S&P	500	and	5.8	%	for	the	Big	Board	Composite	.
The	main	reason	for	this	lag	is	that	individual	investors	own	65	%	of	the	OTC	market	's	capitalization	*ICH*-2	,	according	to	Mr.	Hardiman	,	much	more	than	on	the	Big	Board	.
Such	investors	tend	*-1	to	be	more	cautious	than	institutional	investors	are	*?*	about	*	re-entering	the	market	after	massive	selloffs	,	market	makers	say	0	*T*-2	.
Friday	's	Market	Activity
The	Nasdaq	Composite	Index	tumbled	5.39	,	or	1.2	%	to	452.76	on	Friday	.
For	the	week	,	the	index	dropped	3.8	%	.
Weakness	in	big	technology	stocks	hurt	the	composite	as	well	as	the	Nasdaq	100	Index	,	which	*T*-1	fell	1.4	%	,	or	6.43	,	on	Friday	,	to	437.68	.

The	semiconductor	concern	said	0	the	interruption	in	shipment	of	its	80486	computer	chip	will	be	brief	and	have	little	impact	on	the	company	's	earnings	.

Kirschner	earned	$	376,000	*U*	on	revenue	of	$	14.5	million	*U*	in	the	1988	quarter	.
The	company	blamed	a	number	of	factors	*ICH*-1	for	the	earnings	decline	,	including	softer	sales	of	joint-implants	.
London	share	prices	closed	sharply	lower	Friday	in	active	trading	after	Chancellor	of	the	Exchequer	Nigel	Lawson	's	resignation	slapped	the	market	and	Wall	Street	's	rapid	initial	sell-off	knocked	it	down	.
London	shares	were	depressed	*-1	initially	by	overnight	losses	in	New	York	and	by	the	drop	in	sterling	after	Mr.	Lawson	's	resignation	.
It	showed	some	early	resilience	after	central	bank	support	firmed	sterling	,	but	the	weight	of	Wall	Street	late	in	London	trading	,	and	signs	of	further	weakness	in	the	British	pound	,	proved	a	hefty	load	0	*	to	bear	*T*-1	.
New	York	stocks	recovered	some	of	their	losses	after	the	London	market	closed	.
The	Financial	Times	100-share	index	shed	47.3	points	*-1	to	close	at	2082.1	,	down	4.5	%	from	the	previous	Friday	and	6.8	%	from	Oct.	13	,	when	Wall	Street	's	plunge	helped	spark	the	current	weakness	in	London	*T*-2	.
The	30-share	index	settled	42.0	points	lower	at	1678.5	.
Volume	was	840.8	million	shares	,	up	from	443.6	million	Thursday	and	the	week	's	most	active	session	.
Dealers	said	0	the	turnover	,	largely	confined	*	to	the	100-share	index	stocks	,	partly	reflected	the	flurry	of	activity	typical	at	the	close	of	a	two-week	trading	account	and	the	start	of	a	new	account	.
But	they	said	0	Friday	's	focus	on	the	top-tier	stocks	telegraphed	active	overseas	selling	and	showed	the	broad-based	fears	over	the	status	of	the	U.K.	economy	and	Britain	's	currency	in	the	wake	of	the	upheaval	in	Prime	Minister	Margaret	Thatcher	's	cabinet	.

He	attributed	the	unusually	high	volume	to	broad-based	selling	on	fears	that	the	Thatcher	government	may	be	in	turmoil	and	Britain	's	Labor	Party	positioned	*-1	to	regain	control	of	the	government	and	renew	efforts	at	nationalization	.
British	Gas	shed	8.5	pence	a	share	*-1	to	close	at	185	pence	-LRB-	$	2.90	*U*	-RRB-	.
Other	dealers	added	that	the	blue-chip	stocks	in	general	were	hit	*-1	by	profit-taking	over	concerns	that	London	shares	will	continue	*-2	posting	declines	and	the	uncertainty	over	sterling	given	that	Mr.	Lawson	's	successor	,	John	Major	,	had	only	been	in	the	job	one	day	.
Besides	British	Gas	,	British	Steel	skidded	1.74	to	123.5	on	turnover	of	11	million	shares	.

The	DAX	dropped	19.69	points	Friday	to	1462.93	.
Traders	said	0	the	continued	turbulence	in	other	markets	,	coupled	*	with	the	drop	in	London	following	the	Lawson	resignation	,	were	responsible	.
Traders	said	that	selling	pressure	was	n't	enormous	and	that	the	DAX	dropped	Friday	more	on	a	lack	of	any	substantial	buying	interest	.
They	said	0	contributing	to	the	downward	drift	was	*T*-1	the	fact	that	many	professional	traders	had	chosen	*-2	to	square	positions	ahead	of	the	weekend	.

Traders	said	0	the	market	remains	extremely	nervous	because	of	the	wild	swings	seen	*	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	last	week	.
That	's	leaving	small	investors	with	cold	feet	,	they	said	0	*T*-1	,	and	prompting	institutions	to	take	a	reserved	stance	on	the	sidelines	as	well	,	at	least	until	the	market	in	New	York	settles	down	somewhat	.

There	was	n't	any	evidence	of	survivors	.

The	West	German	machinery	and	plant	equipment	industry	's	orders	rose	an	inflation-adjusted	1	%	in	September	from	a	year	earlier	despite	a	sharp	drop	in	foreign	orders	,	the	German	Association	of	Machinery	Makers	said	0	*T*-1	.
Before	adjustment	for	inflation	,	the	association	said	0	*T*-1	,	orders	were	up	a	nominal	5	%	.
While	domestic	orders	climbed	an	adjusted	8	%	and	a	nominal	11	%	in	September	,	foreign	orders	declined	4	%	after	inflation	and	1	%	on	a	nominal	basis	.
In	the	third	quarter	,	orders	rose	a	real	5	%	and	a	nominal	9	%	.
Domestic	orders	were	up	a	real	11	%	and	a	nominal	14	%	,	while	foreign	orders	rose	a	real	1	%	and	a	nominal	5	%	.
When	Michael	S.	Perry	took	the	podium	at	a	recent	cosmetics	industry	event	*T*-1	,	more	than	500	executives	packing	the	room	snapped	to	attention	.
Mr.	Perry	,	who	*T*-1	runs	Unilever	Group	's	world-wide	personal-care	business	,	paused	*-2	to	scan	the	crowd	.
``	I	see	0	we	have	about	half	the	audience	working	for	us	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	,	tongue	in	cheek	.
``	The	other	half	,	we	may	have	*T*-1	before	long	.	''
Members	of	the	audience	gasped	or	laughed	nervously	;	their	industry	has	been	unsettled	*-1	recently	by	acquisitions	.
First	Unilever	,	the	Anglo-Dutch	packaged-goods	giant	,	spent	$	2	billion	*U*	*-1	to	acquire	brands	such	as	Faberge	and	Elizabeth	Arden	.
It	now	holds	the	No.	3	position	at	U.S.	department-store	cosmetic	counters	.
Then	Procter	&	Gamble	Co.	agreed	*-1	to	buy	Noxell	Corp.	for	$	1.3	billion	*U*	.
That	acquisition	,	0	*T*-2	to	be	completed	*-1	by	year	end	,	will	include	the	Cover	Girl	and	Clarion	makeup	lines	,	*-3	making	P&G	the	top	marketer	of	cosmetics	in	mass-market	outlets	.
It	's	not	so	much	the	idea	of	acquisitions	*ICH*-2	that	*T*-1	has	agitated	the	cosmetics	industry	as	the	companies	doing	the	acquiring	:	P&G	and	Unilever	bring	with	them	great	experience	with	mundane	products	like	soap	and	toilet	paper	,	*-3	sparking	disdain	in	the	glitzy	cosmetics	trade	;	but	they	also	bring	mammoth	marketing	clout	,	*	sparking	fear	.
Though	it	*EXP*-1	is	far	from	certain	that	companies	best	known	*	for	*-2	selling	Promise	margarine	and	Tide	detergent	will	succeed	in	cosmetics	,	there	's	little	doubt	0	they	will	shake	up	the	industry	.
For	now	,	both	companies	are	keeping	quiet	about	their	specific	plans	.
But	industry	watchers	expect	them	to	blend	the	methodical	marketing	strategies	0	they	use	*T*-1	for	more	mundane	products	with	the	more	intuitive	approach	typical	of	cosmetics	companies	.
Likely	changes	include	more	emphasis	on	research	,	soaring	advertising	budgets	and	aggressive	pricing	.
But	some	cosmetics-industry	executives	wonder	whether	techniques	honed	*	in	packaged	goods	will	translate	to	the	cosmetics	business	.
Estee	Lauder	Inc.	,	Revlon	Inc.	and	other	cosmetics	houses	traditionally	have	considered	themselves	fashion	enterprises	whose	product	development	*T*-2	is	guided	*-1	by	the	creative	intuition	of	their	executives	.
Cosmetics	companies	roll	out	new	makeup	colors	several	times	a	year	,	and	since	most	products	can	be	easily	copied	*-1	by	competitors	,	they	're	loath	*-2	to	test	them	with	consumers	.
``	Just	because	upscale	cosmetics	look	like	packaged	goods	and	smell	like	packaged	goods	,	it	does	n't	mean	0	they	are	packaged	goods	,	''	says	*T*-1	Leonard	Lauder	,	chief	executive	of	Estee	Lauder	.
``	They	're	really	fashion	items	wrapped	*	up	in	little	jars	.	''
In	contrast	to	the	more	artistic	nature	of	traditional	cosmetics	houses	,	Unilever	and	P&G	are	the	habitats	of	organization	men	in	gray-flannel	suits	.
Both	companies	are	conservative	marketers	that	*T*-1	rely	on	extensive	market	research	.
P&G	,	in	particular	,	rarely	rolls	out	a	product	nationally	before	extensive	test-marketing	.
Both	can	be	extremely	aggressive	at	*	pricing	such	products	as	soaps	and	diapers	--	to	the	extent	that	some	industry	consultants	predict	0	cents-off	coupons	for	mascara	could	result	from	their	entry	into	the	field	.
P&G	already	has	shown	0	it	can	meld	some	traditional	packaged-goods	techniques	with	the	image-making	of	the	cosmetics	trade	in	the	mass-market	end	of	the	business	.
*	Consider	Oil	of	Olay	,	which	P&G	acquired	*T*-1	as	part	of	Richardson-Vicks	International	in	1985	.
The	moisturizer	,	introduced	*	in	1962	,	had	a	dowdy	image	.
``	Oil	of	Olay	brought	with	it	the	baggage	of	*	being	used	*-1	basically	by	older	women	who	*T*-2	had	already	aged	,	''	says	*T*-3	David	Williams	,	a	consultant	with	New	England	Consulting	Group	.
P&G	set	out	*-1	to	reposition	the	brand	by	*-3	broadening	the	product	line	*-2	to	include	facial	cleansers	and	moisturizers	for	sensitive	skin	.
It	also	redesigned	Oil	of	Olay	's	packaging	,	*-2	stamping	the	traditional	pink	boxes	with	gold	lines	*-1	to	create	a	more	opulent	look	.
Moreover	,	P&G	shifted	its	ad	campaign	from	one	targeting	older	women	to	one	featuring	a	woman	in	her	mid-30s	vowing	``	*	not	to	grow	old	gracefully	.	''
The	company	says	0	sales	have	soared	.
Goliaths	like	Unilever	and	P&G	have	enormous	financial	advantages	over	smaller	rivals	.
Next	year	,	Noxell	plans	*-1	to	roll	out	a	perfume	called	*	Navy	,	says	*T*-2	George	L.	Bunting	Jr.	,	chairman	of	Noxell	.
Without	P&G	's	backing	,	Noxell	might	not	have	been	able	*-1	to	spend	the	estimated	$	5	million	to	$	7	million	*U*	needed	*	*	to	accomplish	that	without	*-2	scrimping	on	its	existing	brands	.
Packaged-goods	companies	``	will	make	it	*EXP*-2	tougher	for	smaller	people	to	remain	competitive	,	''	Mr.	Bunting	says	0	*T*-1	.
Further	consolidations	in	the	industry	could	follow	.
Rumors	that	Unilever	is	interested	in	*-1	acquiring	Schering-Plough	Corp.	's	Maybelline	unit	are	widespread	.
Unilever	wo	n't	comment	;	Schering	,	however	,	denies	0	the	brand	is	for	sale	.
The	presence	of	Unilever	and	P&G	is	likely	*-1	to	increase	the	impact	of	advertising	on	cosmetics	.
While	the	two	are	among	the	world	's	biggest	advertisers	,	most	makers	of	upscale	cosmetics	spend	relatively	little	on	national	ads	.
Instead	,	they	focus	on	events	in	department	stores	and	pour	their	promotional	budgets	into	gifts	that	*T*-1	go	along	with	purchases	.
Estee	Lauder	,	for	example	,	spends	only	an	estimated	5	%	of	sales	on	advertising	in	the	U.S.	,	and	Mr.	Lauder	says	0	he	has	no	plans	*	to	change	his	strategy	.
The	most	dramatic	changes	,	however	,	probably	will	come	in	new-product	development	.
Nearly	70	%	of	cosmetics	sales	come	through	mass-distribution	outlets	such	as	drug	stores	and	supermarkets	,	according	to	Andrew	Shore	,	an	analyst	at	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	Inc	.
That	figure	has	been	inching	up	for	several	years	.
As	the	trend	continues	,	demand	for	mass-market	items	that	*T*-1	are	high	quality	but	only	mid-priced	--	particularly	skin-care	products	--	is	expected	*-2	to	increase	.
This	fall	,	for	example	,	L'Oreal	Group	,	ordinarily	a	high-end	line	,	rolled	out	a	drug-store	line	of	skin-care	products	called	*	Plenitude	,	which	*T*-1	retail	for	$	5	to	$	15	*U*	.
The	packaged-goods	marketers	may	try	*-1	filling	that	gap	with	a	spate	of	new	products	.
Unlike	the	old-line	cosmetics	houses	,	Unilever	and	P&G	both	have	enormous	research	and	development	bases	0	*	to	draw	on	*T*-1	for	new	products	.
P&G	,	in	fact	,	is	noted	*-1	for	*-3	gaining	market	leadership	by	*-4	introducing	products	that	*T*-2	offer	a	technical	edge	over	the	competition	.
Sales	of	its	Tide	detergent	soared	earlier	this	year	,	for	example	,	after	P&G	introduced	a	version	that	*T*-1	includes	a	bleach	safe	for	all	colors	and	fabrics	.
That	's	led	industry	executives	to	speculate	that	future	product	development	will	be	driven	*-1	more	by	technological	innovation	than	by	fashion	whims	--	especially	among	mass-market	brands	.
``	There	will	be	more	emphasis	on	quality	,	''	says	*T*-1	Guy	Peyrelongue	,	chief	executive	of	Cosmair	Inc.	,	the	U.S.	licensee	of	L'Oreal	.
``	You	'll	see	fewer	gimmicks	.	''
But	success	for	Unilever	and	P&G	is	far	from	guaranteed	,	as	*	shown	*-3	by	the	many	consumer-product	companies	that	*T*-2	have	tried	and	failed	*-4	to	master	the	quirky	beauty	business	.
In	the	1970s	,	several	pharmaceutical	and	packaged-goods	companies	,	including	Colgate-Palmolive	Co.	,	Eli	Lilly	&	Co.	,	Pfizer	Inc.	and	Schering-Plough	acquired	cosmetics	companies	.
Industry	consultants	say	0	only	Schering-Plough	,	which	*T*-1	makes	the	mass-market	Maybelline	,	has	maintained	a	meaningful	business	.
Colgate	,	which	*T*-1	acquired	Helena	Rubenstein	in	1973	,	sold	the	brand	seven	years	later	after	the	brand	languished	.
Unilever	already	has	experienced	some	disappointment	.
The	mass-market	Aziza	brand	,	which	it	acquired	*T*-1	in	1987	along	with	Chesebrough-Pond	's	Inc.	,	has	lost	share	,	according	to	industry	analysts	.
The	ritzy	world	of	department-store	cosmetics	retailing	,	where	Unilever	is	concentrating	its	efforts	*T*-1	,	may	prove	even	more	treacherous	.
In	this	niche	,	makeup	colors	change	seasonally	because	they	are	linked	*-1	to	ready-to-wear	fashions	.
Because	brand	loyalty	is	weak	and	most	cosmetics	purchases	are	unplanned	,	careful	training	of	store	sales	staffs	by	cosmetics	companies	is	important	.
And	*	cultivating	a	luxury	image	strong	enough	*	to	persuade	consumers	*-1	to	pay	more	than	$	15	*U*	for	lipstick	or	eye	makeup	requires	a	subtle	touch	that	packaged-goods	companies	have	yet	*-2	to	demonstrate	*T*-3	on	their	own	.
There	may	be	a	truce	in	the	long	war	of	nerves	between	the	White	House	and	Congress	over	how	this	country	conducts	secret	intelligence	operations	abroad	*T*-1	.
After	years	of	mistrust	born	*	of	Watergate	,	past	misdeeds	of	the	Central	Intelligence	Agency	,	and	the	Iran-Contra	scandal	,	President	Bush	and	the	Senate	Intelligence	Committee	appear	ready	--	for	now	,	at	least	--	*-1	to	trust	each	other	when	it	comes	to	*	setting	policy	on	covert	activities	*T*-2	.
If	that	attitude	lasts	,	it	could	infuse	covert	action	planning	with	a	level	of	care	and	confidence	that	*T*-2	has	n't	been	seen	*-1	in	years	.
Over	the	past	week	,	the	president	has	agreed	*-1	to	keep	the	committee	informed	*-2	,	usually	in	advance	,	of	covert	actions	and	to	put	key	intelligence	decisions	in	writing	.
That	was	n't	always	the	way	0	the	Reagan	administration	handled	such	matters	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Bush	has	pledged	as	well	*-1	to	respect	the	14-year-old	executive	order	barring	U.S.	agents	from	*-2	assassinating	foreign	leaders	or	helping	others	to	do	so	.
Congress	never	fully	trusted	former	CIA	chief	William	Casey	and	National	Security	Adviser	John	Poindexter	to	honor	the	ban	.
Despite	objections	by	the	CIA	,	Mr.	Bush	also	has	agreed	to	the	establishment	of	an	inspector	general	at	the	CIA	who	*T*-1	would	be	independent	of	the	CIA	director	.
In	return	,	the	Senate	panel	has	dropped	efforts	*	to	enact	legislation	requiring	the	administration	to	inform	it	within	48	hours	of	the	launching	of	any	covert	activity	.
It	also	has	removed	a	ban	on	CIA	use	of	a	contingency	fund	for	covert	acts	and	has	agreed	*-1	to	wipe	away	some	tortured	and	legalistic	restrictions	on	coup	planning	put	*	in	place	*-2	to	ensure	that	the	CIA	did	n't	get	back	in	the	assassination	game	.
``	We	've	finally	been	able	*-2	to	convince	them	that	Casey	and	-LCB-	Oliver	-RCB-	North	do	n't	work	here	anymore	,	''	says	*T*-1	one	administration	official	.
The	new	understanding	did	n't	just	spring	to	life	in	a	spontaneous	eruption	of	sweetness	and	light	.
It	emerged	after	a	rancorous	display	of	old-style	intelligence	politics	that	*T*-1	followed	this	month	's	failed	coup	attempt	in	Panama	.
The	White	House	used	television	appearances	and	leaks	*-1	to	argue	that	congressionally	imposed	restrictions	on	covert	actions	made	U.S.	support	for	such	coups	difficult	.
Mr.	Bush	even	disclosed	privately	that	one	Reagan-era	deal	with	Congress	required	him	to	notify	the	odious	Panamanian	dictator	,	Manuel	Noriega	,	if	the	U.S.	learned	of	a	coup	plot	that	*T*-1	might	endanger	his	life	.
The	president	also	hinted	0	he	might	veto	this	year	's	intelligence	authorization	bill	if	it	is	too	restrictive	.
Intelligence	Committee	Chairman	David	Boren	-LRB-	D.	,	Okla	.	-RRB-	and	Vice	Chairman	William	Cohen	-LRB-	R.	,	Maine	-RRB-	,	for	their	part	,	angrily	accused	the	White	House	of	*-3	selectively	leaking	classified	documents	and	trying	unfairly	*-2	to	shift	the	blame	*ICH*-1	to	Congress	for	the	bungled	attempt	*	to	topple	Gen.	Noriega	.
The	White	House	got	the	better	of	the	exchange	but	took	care	*-2	not	to	press	its	advantage	to	the	kind	of	constitutional	confrontation	sought	*	by	conservative	Republicans	who	*T*-1	do	n't	want	any	congressional	oversight	of	intelligence	activities	.
Instead	,	Mr.	Bush	and	his	aides	made	it	clear	0	they	respected	Congress	's	role	and	felt	0	they	could	work	with	the	conservative	Mr.	Boren	and	the	moderate	Mr.	Cohen	*-1	to	iron	out	their	differences	.
The	senators	responded	in	kind	.
Sen.	Boren	happily	told	reporters	that	there	had	been	``	a	meeting	of	the	minds	''	with	the	White	House	,	and	that	the	committee	had	given	Mr.	Bush	``	a	clean	slate	,	''	free	of	the	impediments	imposed	*	during	the	Reagan	years	.
Sen.	Cohen	said	0	the	relationship	has	reverted	to	its	pre-Reagan	character	.
There	still	are	some	details	0	*T*-1	to	be	nailed	*-2	down	.
Mr.	Bush	is	reserving	the	right	*ICH*-3	in	``	rare	''	instances	*	to	keep	Congress	in	the	dark	,	*-2	asserting	a	constitutional	prerogative	0	the	committee	does	n't	recognize	*T*-1	.
And	a	pending	Justice	Department	interpretation	of	the	assassination	ban	could	raise	questions	that	*T*-2	would	have	*-3	to	be	settled	*-1	.
Moreover	,	both	sides	may	face	political	critics	.
Some	conservatives	will	accuse	the	president	of	*-1	promising	Congress	too	much	.
And	they	continue	*-1	anonymously	attacking	CIA	Director	William	Webster	for	*-2	being	too	accommodating	to	the	committee	.
At	the	same	time	,	some	congressional	liberals	will	accuse	Sens.	Boren	and	Cohen	of	*-1	wimping	out	,	and	they	will	warn	that	the	lawmakers	'	concessions	raise	the	specter	of	more	internationally	embarrassing	covert	operations	like	the	mining	of	Nicaraguan	harbors	and	the	Iran	arms	sales	.
But	if	the	cooperative	attitude	holds	and	there	is	greater	consultation	on	covert	activities	,	the	country	could	be	entering	an	era	when	such	hare-brained	schemes	are	scrapped	*-1	before	they	get	off	the	drawing	boards	,	while	risky	but	well-planned	secret	operations	can	be	undertaken	*-2	without	fear	that	a	panicky	Congress	will	balk	*T*-3	.
Several	of	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	's	own	listed	companies	,	led	*	by	giant	Contel	Corp.	,	are	joining	for	the	first	time	*-1	to	complain	about	program	trading	and	the	exchange	's	role	in	it	.
*-1	Claiming	0	program	trading	has	turned	the	Big	Board	into	a	``	gambling	casino	,	''	Contel	Chairman	Charles	Wohlstetter	said	that	he	and	at	least	20	other	corporate	executives	are	forming	an	unprecedented	alliance	.
The	group	,	Mr.	Wohlstetter	said	0	*T*-2	in	an	interview	,	wants	*-3	to	end	the	market	's	wild	price	swings	that	critics	blame	*T*-1	on	computer-aided	program-trading	strategies	.
The	group	will	complain	to	Washington	,	to	the	heads	of	program-trading	firms	and	to	the	heads	of	the	Big	Board	itself	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
``	They	should	call	-LCB-	the	exchange	-RCB-	Trump	East	,	''	charged	*T*-2	Mr.	Wohlstetter	,	the	79-year-old	founder	of	Contel	who	*T*-1	's	also	a	former	investment	banker	and	stock	trader	.
``	What	is	the	mission	of	the	financial	community	*T*-1	--
*	to	help	some	scavengers	or	schemers	,	or	help	corporate	America	?	''
Contel	is	a	$	6	billion	*U*	telephone	and	electronics	company	.
Pressure	*ICH*-2	has	been	building	on	the	Big	Board	in	the	past	two	weeks	*	to	do	something	about	market	volatility	,	which	many	investors	say	0	*-3	is	caused	*-1	by	program	trading	.
The	market	's	Friday-the-13th	plunge	of	190	points	in	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	,	and	the	Big	Board	's	understated	response	to	it	,	galvanized	some	longstanding	dissatisfaction	among	companies	listed	*	on	the	exchange	.
Last	month	,	program	trading	accounted	for	a	record	13.8	%	of	average	daily	Big	Board	volume	.
Mr.	Wohlstetter	,	for	example	,	said	0	he	wrote	to	Big	Board	Chairman	John	J.	Phelan	Jr.	about	program	trading	after	the	190-point	Dow	plunge	,	and	as	in	previous	queries	,	``	what	I	get	*T*-1	back	is	gobbledygook	.	''
He	said	0	he	's	upset	that	Mr.	Phelan	,	*-1	trying	*-2	to	calm	investors	after	the	plunge	,	said	that	investors	would	simply	have	*-3	to	get	used	to	the	market	's	big	price	swings	.
The	Big	Board	``	is	partly	*-2	to	blame	*-3	-LCB-	for	the	price	swings	-RCB-	,	because	they	're	cowards	,	''	said	*T*-1	Mr.	Wohlstetter	.
``	Their	powerful	members	manage	them	.	''
The	focus	of	the	outcry	has	been	stock-index	arbitrage	,	which	*T*-1	accounts	for	about	half	the	program	trading	that	*T*-2	goes	on	.
Index	arbitragers	argue	that	their	trading	is	healthy	because	it	links	markets	,	but	critics	say	0	such	trading	accelerates	market	movements	and	increases	the	chance	for	a	crash	.
The	Big	Board	has	refused	*-2	to	be	drawn	*-1	into	a	public	debate	about	program	trading	.
Richard	Grasso	,	Big	Board	president	,	last	week	said	only	that	the	exchange	is	concerned	*-1	about	all	its	constituents	.
Privately	,	exchange	officials	worry	that	without	a	hospitable	system	for	program	trading	at	the	Big	Board	,	billions	of	dollars	in	trading	will	simply	migrate	to	overseas	exchanges	such	as	London	's	.
It	is	partly	for	this	reason	that	the	exchange	last	week	began	*-3	trading	in	its	own	stock	``	basket	''	product	that	*T*-2	allows	big	investors	to	buy	or	sell	all	500	stocks	in	the	Standard	&	Poor	's	index	in	a	single	trade	.
One	intended	customer	of	the	new	basket	product	is	index	arbitragers	,	according	to	the	exchange	.
Investors	have	complained	for	some	time	about	program	trading	,	particularly	index	arbitrage	,	to	little	avail	.
But	according	to	some	Big	Board	traders	,	an	organized	campaign	from	exchange-listed	companies	might	make	the	exchange	finally	consider	big	changes	.
``	They	wo	n't	fight	the	listed	companies	.
Now	the	assault	is	on	,	''	said	*T*-1	one	top	trader	.
The	Big	Board	ca	n't	ban	stock-index	futures	,	of	course	,	but	it	could	ban	use	of	its	high-speed	electronic	trading	system	for	program	trading	or	at	least	encourage	securities	firms	to	back	off	.
The	exchange	put	a	bit	of	a	damper	on	program	trading	when	,	last	year	,	it	simply	started	*-1	to	publish	monthly	statistics	of	each	firm	's	program-trading	volume	*T*-2	.
Contel	's	Mr.	Wohlstetter	said	0	the	group	of	Big	Board	companies	is	n't	ready	*-1	to	go	public	yet	with	its	effort	,	and	that	he	does	n't	plan	*-2	to	be	the	leader	once	it	is	public	.
However	,	he	said	0	he	planned	*-1	to	spend	the	weekend	*-2	making	calls	*-2	to	gather	additional	support	.
Among	those	0	Mr.	Wohlstetter	said	0	he	has	been	talking	to	*T*-2	are	*T*-3	Sanford	Weill	of	Primerica	Corp.	,	which	*T*-1	is	the	parent	of	Smith	Barney	,	Harris	Upham	&	Co.	;	GTE	Corp.	's	James	Johnson	,	and	ITT	Corp.	's	Rand	Araskog	.
None	of	these	chief	executives	were	available	for	comment	.
Among	the	targets	of	the	Big	Board	companies	'	campaign	will	be	*T*-2	some	corporate	pension	funds	that	*T*-1	use	program-trading	strategies	*-3	to	maximize	returns	on	their	investments	.
For	Contel	's	part	,	the	company	a	month	ago	informed	each	of	its	money	managers	that	it	would	drop	them	if	they	give	business	to	program-trading	firms	.
It	was	just	those	kinds	of	ultimatums	that	*T*-1	last	week	succeeded	in	*-2	turning	up	the	heat	in	the	debate	.
Kemper	Corp.	's	Kemper	Financial	Services	unit	said	0	it	cut	off	Bear	Stearns	,	Morgan	Stanley	,	Oppenheimer	and	General	Electric	Co.	's	Kidder	,	Peabody	&	Co.	unit	.
All	of	the	firms	except	Kidder	,	which	*T*-1	is	the	second-biggest	program	trader	on	Wall	Street	,	quickly	announced	pull-backs	from	index	arbitrage	.
Kidder	officials	stand	by	their	aggressive	use	of	program	trading	.
Chief	Executive	Officer	Michael	Carpenter	said	that	despite	the	outcry	even	by	some	of	Kidder	's	own	brokers	,	he	believes	0	index	arbitrage	does	n't	have	a	``	negative	impact	on	the	market	as	a	whole	.
''	However	,	pressure	on	Kidder	's	parent	,	GE	,	could	change	Kidder	's	policy	.
GE	Chairman	John	Welch	has	been	``	besieged	with	phone	calls	''	complaining	about	his	unit	's	program	trading	,	according	to	a	person	close	to	him	.
Margaret	Thatcher	's	instinctive	response	to	the	latest	upheaval	in	her	government	is	*-1	to	promise	business	as	usual	.
That	may	be	the	last	thing	0	she	needs	*T*-1	.
As	the	air	clears	from	last	week	's	storm	of	resignations	and	reshufflings	,	the	government	faces	a	daunting	job	of	*	rebuilding	confidence	in	its	policies	.
The	prime	minister	and	her	new	chancellor	of	the	exchequer	,	the	untested	John	Major	,	need	*-1	to	haul	the	country	through	something	like	a	recession	*-1	to	bring	down	inflation	and	set	the	economy	moving	again	.
Mrs.	Thatcher	has	*-2	to	come	to	terms	with	European	economic	integration	,	beginning	with	the	European	Monetary	System	,	which	Britain	is	committed	*-1	to	*-4	joining	*T*-3	fully	someday	.
Finally	,	the	government	has	*-1	to	convince	a	rattled	financial	community	--	and	voters	--	0	it	is	proceeding	coherently	toward	its	goals	.
It	sounds	like	the	work	of	a	decade	,	but	the	deadline	is	late	1991	,	when	Mrs.	Thatcher	is	expected	*-2	to	call	another	national	election	*T*-1	.
What	*T*-1	's	worrying	her	supporters	is	that	the	economic	cycle	may	be	out	of	kilter	with	the	political	timetable	.
She	could	end	up	*-1	seeking	a	fourth	term	in	an	economy	sick	with	inflation	,	high	interest	rates	and	a	heavy	trade	deficit	.
Though	Mrs.	Thatcher	has	pulled	through	other	crises	,	supporters	wonder	if	her	steely	,	autocratic	ways	are	the	right	formula	today	.
``	There	's	a	rising	fear	that	perhaps	Mrs.	Thatcher	's	style	of	management	has	become	a	political	liability	,	''	says	*T*-1	Bill	Martin	,	senior	economist	at	London	brokers	UBS-Phillips	&	Drew	.
The	prime	minister	's	insistence	on	*	keeping	a	private	coterie	of	advisers	--	including	an	economic	guru	who	*T*-1	openly	criticized	former	Chancellor	of	the	Exchequer	Nigel	Lawson	--	confused	the	financial	community	.
Last	week	,	the	strategy	of	*	playing	the	two	experts	off	each	other	blew	up	:	Mr.	Lawson	quit	in	exasperation	and	Sir	Alan	Walters	,	the	adviser	,	announced	his	resignation	within	an	hour	.
The	confusion	could	be	costly	.
Currency	traders	,	suspecting	0	Mr.	Major	wo	n't	defend	the	pound	strenuously	,	sent	the	British	currency	sharply	lower	*ICH*-1	Friday	against	the	dollar	and	West	German	mark	.
Analysts	expect	further	jitters	this	week	.
A	continuing	slide	in	the	pound	could	force	the	government	to	push	through	another	rise	in	the	base	rate	,	currently	15	%	.
That	could	shove	a	weak	economy	into	recession	.
Economists	have	been	anticipating	a	slump	for	months	,	but	they	now	say	0	it	will	be	deeper	and	longer	than	they	had	thought	*?*	.
Britain	's	economy	``	is	developing	rapidly	toward	no-growth	,	''	says	0	*T*-1	J.	Paul	Horne	,	international	economist	with	Smith	Barney	,	Harris	Upham	Co.	in	Paris	.
A	mild	slowdown	probably	would	have	run	its	course	by	early	1991	,	economists	say	0	*T*-1	,	while	the	grueling	downturn	now	expected	*	could	stretch	into	1992	.
Recovery	could	be	hampered	*-1	if	Britain	's	major	trading	partners	in	Europe	,	which	*T*-2	are	enjoying	robust	economic	activity	,	cool	off	as	*	expected	*-3	in	late	1990	and	1991	.
That	would	leave	Mrs.	Thatcher	little	room	for	maneuver	.
For	the	Tories	to	win	the	next	election	,	voters	will	need	*-1	to	sense	economic	improvement	for	about	a	year	beforehand	.
Though	Mrs.	Thatcher	does	n't	need	*-1	to	call	an	election	until	June	1992	,	she	would	prefer	*-2	doing	so	in	late	1991	.
``	If	the	economy	shows	no	sign	of	*	turning	around	in	about	year	's	time	,	she	will	be	very	vulnerable	,	''	says	*T*-1	John	Barnes	,	a	lecturer	at	the	London	School	of	Economics	.
There	's	an	equally	pressing	deadline	for	the	government	to	define	its	monetary	and	economic	ties	to	the	rest	of	the	European	Community	.
It	has	sent	mixed	signals	about	its	willingness	*	to	take	part	in	the	exchange-rate	mechanism	of	the	European	Monetary	System	,	which	*T*-1	links	the	major	EC	currencies	.
At	a	June	EC	summit	,	Mrs.	Thatcher	appeared	*-1	to	ease	her	opposition	to	full	EMS	membership	,	*-1	saying	0	Britain	would	join	once	its	inflation	rate	fell	and	the	EC	liberalized	capital	movements	.
Since	then	,	the	government	has	left	observers	wondering	if	it	ever	meant	*-1	to	join	.
Sir	Alan	assailed	the	monetary	arrangement	as	``	half-baked	''	in	an	article	being	published	*	in	an	American	economics	journal	.
That	produced	little	reaction	from	his	boss	,	*	reinforcing	speculation	0	the	government	would	use	its	two	conditions	as	a	pretext	for	*	avoiding	full	EMS	membership	.
Despite	the	departure	of	Mr.	Lawson	and	Sir	Alan	,	the	tug-of-war	over	the	EMS	could	continue	.
Sir	Geoffrey	Howe	,	deputy	prime	minister	and	a	Lawson	ally	on	the	EMS	,	has	signaled	0	he	will	continue	*-1	pressing	for	early	membership	.
Of	immediate	concern	is	*T*-1	whether	the	Thatcher	government	will	continue	Mr.	Lawson	's	policy	of	*	tracking	the	monetary	policies	of	the	West	German	Bundesbank	and	responding	in	kind	when	the	Frankfurt	authorities	move	interest	rates	*T*-2	.
Mrs.	Thatcher	``	does	n't	like	*-2	taking	orders	from	foreigners	,	''	says	0	*T*-1	Tim	Congdon	,	economist	with	Gerrard	&	National	Holding	PLC	.
As	Conservatives	rally	around	Mrs.	Thatcher	during	the	crisis	,	many	harbor	hopes	0	last	week	's	debacle	will	prompt	change	.
``	We	wo	n't	have	any	more	of	this	wayward	behavior	,	''	says	*T*-1	Sir	Peter	Hordern	,	a	backbench	Tory	member	of	Parliament	.
``	The	party	is	fed	up	with	sackings	of	good	people	.	''
It	's	an	unrealistic	expectation	.
As	long	as	a	decade	ago	,	Mrs.	Thatcher	declared	0	she	did	n't	want	debate	in	her	cabinet	;	she	wanted	strong	government	.
Over	the	weekend	,	she	said	0	she	did	n't	intend	*-1	to	change	her	style	and	denied	0	she	is	authoritarian	.
``	Nonsense	,	''	she	told	an	interviewer	*-1	yesterday	on	London	Weekend	Television	.

Wives	May	Not	Benefit	When	Men	Do	Chores	*T*-1
WHEN	HUSBANDS	take	on	more	housework	*T*-1	,	they	tend	*-2	to	substitute	for	chores	done	*	by	the	kids	rather	than	by	the	wife	.
Rand	Corp.	researchers	Linda	Waite	and	Frances	Goldscheider	analyzed	a	large	sample	of	married	women	with	at	least	one	child	at	home	between	the	ages	of	six	and	18	.
The	women	indicated	which	family	member	*T*-1	usually	did	various	household	chores	and	the	approximate	share	0	each	did	*T*-2	.
Not	unexpectedly	,	wives	,	whether	*-1	working	or	non-working	,	did	by	far	the	most	--	about	80	%	of	the	shopping	,	laundry	and	cooking	,	and	about	two-thirds	of	housecleaning	,	*	washing	dishes	,	child	care	and	family	paper	work	.
Only	for	yardwork	and	home	maintenance	did	women	do	less	than	half	.
But	the	researchers	found	that	while	children	's	household	tasks	eased	the	mother	's	burden	appreciably	,	the	husband	's	helping	hand	``	appears	*-1	to	lighten	the	children	's	load	almost	on	a	one-for-one	basis	and	to	reduce	the	wife	's	responsibility	only	modestly	.	''
This	pattern	was	particularly	evident	among	more	highly	educated	couples	.
In	these	families	,	husbands	took	on	80	%	more	chores	than	in	couples	with	only	grammar	school	education	.
But	the	kids	with	highly	educated	parents	did	68	%	less	housework	than	those	in	less-educated	families	.
``	It	*EXP*-1	is	clear	,	''	Ms.	Waite	says	0	*T*-3	,	``	that	most	of	the	effect	of	increasing	education	has	been	*-4	to	shift	who	*T*-2	is	helping	the	wife\/mother	.
Her	share	decreases	*NOT*	,	but	only	slightly	.	''
Nursing	Home	Patients	Apt	*-1	to	Be	Private	Payers
FAR	FEWER	elderly	nursing	home	residents	*ICH*-2	bankrupt	themselves	than	*	was	previously	believed	*-1	,	two	recent	studies	declare	0	*T*-3	.
State	governments	place	very	low	ceilings	on	how	much	property	people	may	own	*T*-1	*RNR*-3	or	how	much	income	they	may	keep	*T*-2	*RNR*-3	if	they	want	welfare	help	on	medical	bills	.
Conventional	wisdom	has	long	held	that	anywhere	from	one-fourth	to	one-half	of	all	elderly	long-term	care	patients	are	obliged	*-1	to	spend	themselves	into	poverty	before	*-1	qualifying	for	Medicaid	assistance	.
But	separate	reports	from	Joshua	Weiner	and	Denise	Spence	of	the	Brookings	Institution	and	Korbin	Liu	of	the	Urban	Institute	find	that	``	a	surprisingly	small	proportion	''	--	only	about	10	%	--	of	residents	start	out	as	private	payers	but	``	spend	down	''	to	Medicaid	levels	in	a	single	nursing	home	stay	before	they	die	or	are	discharged	*-1	.
-LRB-	Another	one-third	*ICH*-1	are	already	on	Medicaid	when	they	enter	the	nursing	homes	*T*-2	,	a	considerably	higher	proportion	than	the	analysts	anticipated	*?*	.	-RRB-
But	a	remarkably	high	percentage	--	over	half	--	are	private	payers	throughout	their	stay	,	even	a	fairly	lengthy	one	.
About	one-third	pay	out	of	their	own	pockets	,	while	the	rest	are	covered	*-1	throughout	by	Medicare	,	private	insurers	or	the	Veterans	Administration	.
Both	reports	are	based	*-1	on	several	thousand	patients	sampled	*	in	a	1985	nationwide	government	survey	.
The	Brookings	and	Urban	Institute	authors	caution	,	however	,	that	most	nursing	home	stays	are	of	comparatively	short	duration	,	and	*	reaching	the	Medicaid	level	is	more	likely	with	an	unusually	long	stay	or	repeated	stays	.
Moreover	,	they	note	0	*T*-2	,	those	who	*T*-1	manage	*-3	to	pay	their	own	way	often	do	so	only	by	*	selling	their	homes	,	using	up	life	savings	or	drawing	heavily	on	children	and	other	relatives	.
Reagan	Era	Young	Hold	Liberal	Views
THE	REAGAN	generation	young	men	and	women	reaching	political	maturity	during	Ronald	Reagan	's	presidency	--	are	firmly	liberal	on	race	and	gender	,	according	to	NORC	,	the	social	science	research	center	at	the	University	of	Chicago	.
Many	political	analysts	have	speculated	that	the	Reagan	years	would	produce	a	staunchly	conservative	younger	generation	.
NORC	's	most	recent	opinion	surveys	find	the	youngest	adults	indeed	somewhat	more	pro-Reagan	and	pro-Republican	than	other	adults	.
But	,	says	0	*T*-1	chief	investigator	Tom	Smith	,	this	``	does	not	translate	into	support	for	conservatism	in	general	or	into	conservative	positions	on	feminist	and	civil	rights	issues	.	''
Answers	to	a	dozen	questions	in	the	1986	,	1987	,	1988	and	1989	national	surveys	reveal	that	men	and	women	in	the	18	to	24	age	bracket	are	considerably	more	liberal	on	race	and	gender	than	were	*?*	the	18	to	24	year	olds	in	NORC	's	polling	in	the	early	1970s	and	early	1980s	.
They	were	also	as	liberal	*RNR*-1	or	more	liberal	*RNR*-1	than	any	other	age	group	in	the	1986	through	1989	surveys	.
For	example	,	66	%	of	the	18	to	24	year	olds	in	the	four	latest	surveys	favored	an	``	open	housing	''	law	prohibiting	homeowners	from	*-2	refusing	on	racial	grounds	*-1	to	sell	to	prospective	buyers	.
That	compares	with	58	%	of	the	similar	age	group	in	the	1980	through	1982	surveys	and	55	%	in	the	1972	through	1975	surveys	.
*-1	Asked	*-3	whether	they	agreed	or	disagreed	with	the	claim	that	men	are	emotionally	better	*ICH*-2	suited	to	politics	than	women	,	70	%	of	the	Reagan	generation	disagreed	,	compared	with	under	60	%	of	younger	men	and	women	in	the	earlier	years	.
Odds	and	Ends
SEPARATED	and	divorced	men	and	women	are	far	more	likely	*-1	to	be	smokers	than	married	persons	,	the	Centers	for	Disease	Control	discovers	0	*T*-3	...	.

October	was	an	edgy	month	for	the	practitioners	of	glasnost	,	the	official	Soviet	policy	of	*	allowing	more	candor	from	the	nation	's	media	.
For	one	of	the	superstars	of	glasnost	,	Vitaly	Korotich	,	editor	of	the	trail-blazing	weekly	Ogonyok	,	Friday	,	Oct.	20	was	a	somersaulting	day	that	*T*-1	turned	from	tension	to	elation	.
He	had	been	summoned	*-1	to	the	Central	Committee	of	the	Soviet	Communist	Party	,	after	he	finished	his	lunch	at	the	Savoy	Hotel	,	an	unlikely	prelude	to	a	bureaucratic	brow-beating	:	Eight-foot-tall	Rubenesquely	naked	ladies	float	on	their	canvases	toward	a	ceiling	teeming	with	cherubs	,	all	surrounded	*	by	gilt	laid	*	on	with	a	pastry	chef	's	trowel	and	supported	*	by	marble	corinthian	columns	whose	capitals	*T*-2	are	fluting	fountains	of	gold	.
Why	had	Mr.	Korotich	been	called	*-1	*T*-2	?
``	I	told	my	driver	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	,	``	that	he	was	taking	my	butt	to	the	Central	Committee	so	they	can	*?*	...	''	whack	,	whack	,	whack	his	hand	made	vigorous	spanking	gestures	on	his	left	palm	.	``
They	feel	the	need	*ICH*-2	from	time	to	time	*	to	`	educate	'	me	.	''
And	indeed	,	as	he	later	reported	,	that	was	the	import	of	the	meeting	.
Anxious	allies	of	President	Mikhail	Gorbachev	are	cautioning	media	leaders	to	take	it	easy	,	to	be	careful	*-2	not	to	do	anything	that	*T*-3	could	be	used	*-1	by	Mr.	Gorbachev	's	opponents	.
The	government	is	nervous	.
According	to	Mr.	Korotich	,	who	*T*-1	was	present	,	Mr.	Gorbachev	's	publicized	tongue-lashing	of	the	press	on	Oct.	13	was	more	of	a	plea	:	``	*	Be	careful	boys	;	*	use	good	judgment	.
We	're	standing	in	gasoline	,	so	*	do	n't	smoke	!	''
U.S.	and	northern	European	diplomats	confirm	Mr.	Korotich	's	assessment	that	glasnost	is	in	no	immediate	danger	.
In	fact	,	a	very	high-ranking	Soviet	official	told	an	American	official	at	a	diplomatic	dinner	that	no	change	in	the	policy	was	contemplated	*-1	.
The	day	after	that	conversation	at	the	residence	of	the	U.S.	ambassador	,	the	Brezhnevite	editor	of	Pravda	,	Victor	Afnasjev	,	was	replaced	*-1	by	a	college	classmate	of	Mr.	Gorbachev	's	.
Brezhnevite	holdovers	have	more	0	*	to	fear	*T*-2	from	Mr.	Gorbachev	than	the	verbal	spanking	0	he	gave	*T*-1	to	the	press	.
At	the	end	of	the	very	week	in	which	Mr.	Korotich	was	called	*-1	to	the	Central	Committee	*T*-3	,	Ogonyok	was	again	demonstrating	its	independence	by	*-4	printing	a	poll	that	*T*-2	showed	that	35	%	of	the	Soviet	population	,	a	plurality	,	believed	that	Mr.	Gorbachev	's	economic	reforms	,	perestroika	,	would	result	in	only	insignificant	change	.
A	good	measurement	of	the	popularity	of	ice-breaker	journals	like	Ogonyok	is	circulation	.
When	Mr.	Korotich	took	it	over	in	1986	*T*-1	,	it	sold	250,000	copies	;	today	it	sells	3.4	million	.
Pravda	,	meanwhile	,	has	retained	only	57	%	of	its	1986	readership	.
Glasnost	has	made	celebrities	of	men	like	Mr.	Korotich	.
*-2	Prevented	*-1	by	the	Communist	Party	from	*-3	getting	on	its	slate	of	nominees	for	the	new	Supreme	Soviet	,	he	stood	as	an	independent	candidate	for	Congress	from	his	native	Ukraine	and	won	with	84	%	of	the	vote	.
The	same	evening	that	he	was	summoned	*-1	for	a	warning	from	the	Party	*T*-4	,	he	was	cheered	*-2	by	thousands	of	his	supporters	at	a	rally	of	what	*T*-5	can	only	be	called	*-3	the	Korotich	party	.
But	*	as	astounding	as	the	changes	that	*T*-1	have	already	occurred	are	*?*	,	there	is	a	fragility	to	glasnost	.
Censorship	is	n't	a	Marxist	invention	.
The	czars	were	no	civil	libertarians	.
As	late	as	the	1890s	,	the	Russian	government	prevented	any	coverage	of	famines	.
It	even	directed	newspapers	not	to	publish	anything	that	*T*-1	might	stain	the	honor	of	the	Turkish	sultan	's	wives	.
So	glasnost	is	not	a	value	woven	*	with	steel	threads	into	the	fabric	of	Russian	society	.
It	is	an	admirable	public	relations	program	initiated	*	by	a	single	political	leader	during	a	four-year	blink	of	history	.
It	is	public	relations	of	the	highest	sophistication	,	that	*T*-2	recognizes	that	credibility	is	enhanced	*-1	by	honesty	--	up	to	a	point	.
What	is	that	point	*T*-1	?
Will	Ogonyok	begin	a	series	of	reports	analyzing	the	failures	of	perestroika	?
``	I	'd	be	destroying	myself	,	''	replies	*T*-3	Mr.	Korotich	,	who	*T*-1	then	asks	,	``	What	would	that	accomplish	*T*-2	?
''	His	answer	reveals	his	vulnerability	--	it	also	draws	the	line	that	Soviet	society	must	cross	*T*-1	*-2	to	enter	the	normal	dialogue	of	Western	culture	.
It	is	the	line	beyond	which	the	press	can	report	not	only	on	the	bankruptcy	of	factories	but	on	the	failures	of	even	admirable	leaders	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Ayers	is	editor	and	publisher	of	the	Anniston	,	Ala.	,	Star	.
A	state	trial	judge	in	Illinois	gave	preliminary	approval	to	a	proposed	settlement	of	a	suit	against	a	Bank	of	New	York	Co.	unit	,	Irving	Trust	Co.	,	over	the	interest	rates	on	Irving	's	former	One	Wall	Street	Account	money-market	deposit	accounts	.
Judge	Albert	Green	,	in	Cook	County	Circuit	Court	in	Chicago	,	also	recognized	the	suit	,	filed	*	last	May	by	Robert	and	Cynthia	Langendorf	,	as	a	class	action	covering	thousands	of	Irving	customers	.
The	plaintiffs	accused	Irving	of	*-2	paying	less	interest	than	*	promised	*?*	in	a	marketing	brochure	.
Irving	maintained	--	and	still	does	*?*	--	that	its	actions	were	proper	under	its	account	agreements	with	customers	.
Under	the	proposed	settlement	,	customers	with	valid	claims	--	0	*T*-2	to	be	submitted	*-1	by	Dec.	15	--	will	receive	``	valuable	bank	services	,	''	such	as	credit	cards	with	reduced	finance	charges	,	for	two	years	.
Larry	Drury	,	attorney	for	the	plaintiffs	,	valued	the	settlement	at	between	$	6	million	and	$	8	million	*U*	.
A	Bank	of	New	York	spokesman	in	Manhattan	,	Owen	Brady	,	said	,	``	That	's	the	maximum	,	outside	figure	.
Federal	Reserve	critics	used	*-1	to	complain	of	``	stop	and	go	''	monetary	policies	.
They	claimed	that	the	Fed	would	first	give	a	green	light	to	the	economy	by	*-1	making	credit	readily	available	and	then	turn	on	the	red	and	bring	growth	to	a	screeching	halt	.
But	under	Alan	Greenspan	that	has	changed	.
*-1	A	supremely	cautious	man	,	the	Fed	chairman	is	forever	blinking	yellow	.
Indeed	,	his	caution	has	become	legendary	within	the	government	.
He	fusses	endlessly	over	economic	statistics	,	*-1	dissecting	them	in	dozens	of	ways	,	*-1	probing	for	hours	in	search	of	potential	problems	.
After	*-4	thoroughly	digesting	reams	of	information	,	he	often	concludes	that	more	data	are	needed	*-1	,	and	when	he	finally	decides	*-3	to	act	*T*-2	,	his	movements	sometimes	seem	excrutiatingly	small	.
Such	caution	was	evident	after	the	recent	Friday-the-13th	stock	market	plunge	.
Some	Bush	administration	officials	urged	Mr.	Greenspan	*-1	to	make	an	immediate	public	announcement	of	his	plans	*	to	provide	ample	credit	to	the	markets	.
But	he	refused	,	*-2	claiming	that	he	wanted	*-3	to	see	what	*T*-1	happened	Monday	morning	before	*-3	making	any	public	statement	.
Mr.	Greenspan	's	decision	*	to	keep	quiet	also	prompted	a	near-mutiny	within	the	Fed	's	ranks	.
A	``	senior	Fed	official	''	spoke	on	Saturday	after	the	market	swoon	to	both	the	Washington	Post	and	the	New	York	Times	,	*-1	saying	0	the	Fed	was	prepared	*-2	to	provide	as	much	credit	as	the	markets	needed	*?*	.
The	statement	angered	Chairman	Greenspan	,	but	it	was	greeted	*-1	with	applause	by	the	Bush	administration	and	the	financial	markets	.
And	,	while	the	mutinous	Fed	member	has	n't	gone	public	,	some	Fed	governors	,	most	notably	Vice	Chairman	Manuel	Johnson	,	are	known	*-1	to	have	disagreed	with	the	chairman	's	decision	*	to	remain	silent	.
Ironically	,	the	anonymous	official	's	comments	have	earned	some	plaudits	for	Mr.	Greenspan	,	who	*T*-1	is	mistakenly	seen	as	the	source	.
At	a	hearing	last	week	,	Democratic	Sen.	Chris	Dodd	of	Connecticut	told	Treasury	Secretary	Nicholas	Brady	that	``	Chairman	Greenspan	's	''	announcement	over	the	Oct.	13	weekend	was	a	``	very	important	statement	.	''
Mr.	Brady	hesitantly	replied	that	he	was	n't	sure	whether	Mr.	Greenspan	``	made	a	statement	himself	,	or	whether	that	was	a	newspaper	report	.	''
The	Fed	chairman	's	caution	was	apparent	again	on	the	Monday	morning	after	the	market	's	plunge	,	when	the	central	bank	took	only	modest	steps	0	*T*-2	to	aid	the	markets	*T*-1	.
A	surprisingly	small	amount	of	reserves	was	added	*-1	to	the	banking	system	.
And	,	by	the	end	of	that	week	,	the	key	federal	funds	interest	rate	,	which	*T*-1	is	largely	controlled	*-3	by	the	Fed	,	had	settled	at	8.75	%	,	barely	changed	*	from	the	level	of	just	under	9	%	that	*T*-2	prevailed	the	previous	week	.
Bush	administration	officials	appear	increasingly	concerned	that	Mr.	Greenspan	is	cautious	to	a	fault	.
Signs	of	growing	weakness	in	the	economy	,	paired	*	with	indications	that	inflation	is	staying	well	under	control	,	have	caused	them	to	wonder	why	the	Fed	chairman	is	so	grudging	in	*-2	reducing	rates	*T*-1	.
Those	concerns	are	n't	expressed	*-1	in	public	.
In	fact	,	the	administration	and	the	Fed	have	been	going	out	of	their	way	in	the	past	two	weeks	*-1	to	dispel	any	impression	that	they	are	at	odds	,	*-1	fearing	0	stories	about	an	administration-Fed	split	added	to	the	stock	market	's	jitters	.
Still	,	the	split	is	there	.
The	administration	's	concerns	are	understandable	.
The	economy	is	showing	signs	of	weakness	,	particularly	among	manufacturers	.
Exports	,	which	*T*-1	played	a	key	role	in	*	fueling	growth	over	the	last	two	years	,	seem	*-2	to	have	stalled	.
Factory	payrolls	and	production	fell	in	September	,	and	the	auto	industry	and	housing	are	in	a	severe	crunch	.
But	Mr.	Greenspan	remains	reluctant	*-2	to	loosen	policy	,	partly	because	he	faces	a	phalanx	of	presidents	of	regional	Fed	banks	who	*T*-1	oppose	credit	easing	.
In	addition	,	the	chairman	has	a	wary	eye	aimed	*	a	year	or	two	down	the	road	.
Inflation	may	be	stable	at	the	moment	,	*-1	running	at	about	4.5	%	.
But	if	the	Fed	eases	too	soon	,	Mr.	Greenspan	fears	0	*T*-1	,	prices	may	begin	*-2	to	accelerate	again	next	year	.
Moreover	,	if	the	Fed	holds	tight	,	it	may	be	able	*-2	gradually	to	reduce	inflation	,	*-3	moving	toward	the	zero-inflation	goal	that	the	Fed	chairman	embraced	*T*-1	in	testimony	to	Congress	last	week	.
So	far	,	Mr.	Greenspan	's	cautious	approach	to	policy	has	served	both	him	and	the	nation	well	.
His	hand	on	the	monetary	tiller	seems	one	reason	why	the	economy	next	month	seems	highly	likely	*-1	to	begin	an	unprecedented	eighth	year	of	peacetime	growth	without	a	recession	*T*-2	.
``	We	've	gotten	through	two	stock	market	crashes	,	and	we	've	gone	through	an	election	without	any	major	problems	,	''	says	*T*-1	David	Hale	,	an	economist	of	Kemper	Financial	Services	.
``	I	think	0	you	have	*-1	to	give	Greenspan	a	good	rating	.	''
But	such	caution	is	no	guarantee	against	mistakes	.
The	Fed	's	reluctance	*	to	ease	credit	now	could	be	laying	the	groundwork	for	a	new	recession	,	perhaps	starting	early	next	year	.
If	that	happens	,	Chairman	Greenspan	could	well	become	an	open	target	.
Already	,	Congress	is	toying	with	legislation	0	*T*-1	to	curb	the	Fed	's	independence	.
If	the	economy	turns	down	,	such	proposals	could	gain	strong	momentum	.
The	following	issues	were	recently	filed	*-1	with	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	:
ECI	Environmental	Inc.	,	initial	offering	of	1.1	million	shares	,	of	which	ECI	will	sell	990,000	*T*-1	and	co-founders	will	sell	110,000	shares	*T*-1	,	via	Oppenheimer	&	Co	.
Fastenal	Co.	,	proposed	offering	of	400,000	common	shares	by	holders	,	via	Robert	W.	Baird	&	Co.	and	William	Blair	&	Co	.
First	Capital	Holdings	Corp.	,	proposed	offering	of	$	275	million	*U*	of	floating	rate	senior	notes	,	via	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	Inc	.
Industrial	Funding	Corp.	,	initial	offering	of	common	stock	,	via	Alex	.	Brown	&	Sons	Inc.	and	Piper	Jaffray	&	Hopwood	.
Parametric	Technology	Corp.	,	initial	offering	of	1.7	million	common	shares	,	of	which	1,365,226	shares	*T*-2	will	be	sold	*-1	by	the	company	and	334,774	shares	*T*-2	by	holders	,	via	Alex	Brown	&	Sons	,	Hambrecht	&	Quist	and	Wessels	,	Arnold	&	Henderson	.
Union	Camp	Corp.	,	shelf	offering	of	up	to	$	250	million	*U*	of	debt	securities	.
Spencer	J.	Volk	,	president	and	chief	operating	officer	of	this	consumer	and	industrial	products	company	,	was	elected	*-1	a	director	.
Mr.	Volk	,	55	years	old	,	succeeds	Duncan	Dwight	,	who	*T*-1	retired	in	September	.
In	an	age	of	specialization	,	the	federal	judiciary	is	one	of	the	last	bastions	of	the	generalist	.
A	judge	must	jump	from	murder	to	antitrust	cases	,	from	arson	to	securities	fraud	,	without	*-1	missing	a	beat	.
But	even	on	the	federal	bench	,	specialization	is	creeping	in	,	and	it	has	become	a	subject	of	sharp	controversy	on	the	newest	federal	appeals	court	.
The	Court	of	Appeals	for	the	Federal	Circuit	was	created	*-1	in	1982	*-1	to	serve	,	among	other	things	,	as	the	court	of	last	resort	for	most	patent	disputes	.
Previously	,	patent	cases	moved	through	the	court	system	to	one	of	the	12	circuit	appeals	courts	.
There	,	judges	who	*T*-1	saw	few	such	cases	and	*T*-1	had	no	experience	in	the	field	grappled	with	some	of	the	most	technical	and	complex	disputes	imaginable	.
A	new	specialty	court	was	sought	*-1	by	patent	experts	,	who	*T*-2	believed	that	the	generalists	had	botched	too	many	important	,	multimillion-dollar	cases	.
Some	patent	lawyers	had	hoped	that	such	a	specialty	court	would	be	filled	*-1	with	experts	in	the	field	.
But	the	Reagan	administration	thought	otherwise	,	and	so	may	*T*-1	the	Bush	administration	.
Since	1984	,	the	president	has	filled	four	vacancies	in	the	Federal	Circuit	court	with	non-patent	lawyers	.
Now	only	three	of	the	12	judges	--	Pauline	Newman	,	Chief	Judge	Howard	T.	Markey	,	68	,	and	Giles	Rich	,	85	--	have	patent-law	backgrounds	.
The	latter	two	and	Judge	Daniel	M.	Friedman	,	73	,	are	approaching	senior	status	or	retirement	.
Three	seats	currently	are	vacant	and	three	others	are	likely	*-3	to	be	filled	*-1	within	a	few	years	,	so	patent	lawyers	and	research-based	industries	are	making	a	new	push	for	specialists	0	*T*-4	to	be	added	*-2	to	the	court	.
Several	organizations	,	including	the	Industrial	Biotechnical	Association	and	the	Pharmaceutical	Manufacturers	Association	,	have	asked	the	White	House	and	Justice	Department	*-1	to	name	candidates	with	both	patent	and	scientific	backgrounds	.
The	associations	would	like	the	court	to	include	between	three	and	six	judges	with	specialized	training	.
Some	of	the	associations	have	recommended	Dr.	Alan	D.	Lourie	,	54	,	a	former	patent	agent	with	a	doctorate	in	organic	chemistry	who	*T*-1	now	is	associate	general	counsel	with	SmithKline	Beckman	Corp.	in	Philadelphia	.
Dr.	Lourie	says	0	the	Justice	Department	interviewed	him	last	July	.
Their	effort	has	received	a	lukewarm	response	from	the	Justice	Department	.
``	We	do	not	feel	that	seats	are	reserved	*-1	-LRB-	for	patent	lawyers	-RRB-	,	''	says	*T*-4	Justice	spokesman	David	Runkel	,	who	*T*-3	declines	*-5	to	say	how	soon	a	candidate	will	be	named	*-2	*T*-6	.
``	But	we	will	take	it	into	consideration	.	''
The	Justice	Department	's	view	is	shared	*-1	by	other	lawyers	and	at	least	one	member	of	the	court	,	Judge	H.	Robert	Mayer	,	a	former	civil	litigator	who	*T*-3	served	at	the	claims	court	trial	level	before	he	was	appointed	*-2	to	the	Federal	Circuit	two	years	ago	.
``	I	believe	that	any	good	lawyer	should	be	able	*-4	to	figure	out	*RNR*-5	and	understand	*RNR*-5	patent	law	,	''	Judge	Mayer	says	*T*-6	,	*-2	adding	that	``	it	*EXP*-3	's	the	responsibility	of	highly	paid	lawyers	-LRB-	who	*T*-1	argue	before	the	court	-RRB-	*	to	make	us	understand	-LRB-	complex	patent	litigation	-RRB-	.	''
Yet	some	lawyers	point	to	Eli	Lilly	&	Co.	vs.	Medtronic	,	Inc.	,	the	patent	infringement	case	0	the	Supreme	Court	this	month	agreed	*-3	to	review	*T*-2	,	as	an	example	of	poor	legal	reasoning	by	judges	who	*T*-1	lack	patent	litigation	experience	.
-LRB-	Judge	Mayer	was	not	on	the	three-member	panel	.	-RRB-
In	the	Lilly	case	,	the	appeals	court	broadly	construed	a	federal	statute	to	grant	Medtronic	,	a	medical	device	manufacturer	,	an	exemption	0	*	to	infringe	a	patent	under	certain	circumstances	*T*-1	.
If	the	Supreme	Court	holds	in	Medtronic	's	favor	,	the	decision	will	have	billion-dollar	consequences	for	the	manufacturers	of	medical	devices	,	color	and	food	additives	and	all	other	non-drug	products	that	*T*-1	required	Food	&	Drug	Administration	approval	.
Lisa	Raines	,	a	lawyer	and	director	of	government	relations	for	the	Industrial	Biotechnical	Association	,	contends	that	a	judge	well-versed	in	patent	law	and	the	concerns	of	research-based	industries	would	have	ruled	otherwise	.
And	Judge	Newman	,	a	former	patent	lawyer	,	wrote	in	her	dissent	when	the	court	denied	a	motion	for	a	rehearing	of	the	case	by	the	full	court	*T*-1	,	``	The	panel	's	judicial	legislation	has	affected	an	important	high-technological	industry	,	without	regard	to	the	consequences	for	research	and	innovation	or	the	public	interest	.	''
Says	*ICH*-1	Ms.	Raines	,	``	-LRB-	The	judgment	-RRB-	confirms	our	concern	that	the	absence	of	patent	lawyers	on	the	court	could	prove	troublesome	.

The	date	was	misstated	*-1	in	Friday	's	edition	.
Kidder	,	Peabody	&	Co.	is	trying	*-1	to	struggle	back	.
Only	a	few	months	ago	,	the	124-year-old	securities	firm	seemed	*-2	to	be	on	the	verge	of	a	meltdown	,	*-2	racked	*-1	by	internal	squabbles	and	defections	.
Its	relationship	with	parent	General	Electric	Co.	had	been	frayed	*-1	since	a	big	Kidder	insider-trading	scandal	two	years	ago	.
Chief	executives	and	presidents	had	come	and	gone	.
Now	,	the	firm	says	0	it	's	at	a	turning	point	.
By	the	end	of	this	year	,	63-year-old	Chairman	Silas	Cathcart	--	the	former	chairman	of	Illinois	Tool	Works	who	*T*-2	was	derided	*-1	as	a	``	tool-and-die	man	''	when	GE	brought	him	in	*-4	to	clean	up	Kidder	in	1987	*T*-3	--	retires	to	his	Lake	Forest	,	Ill.	,	home	,	possibly	*-6	to	build	a	shopping	mall	on	some	land	0	he	owns	*T*-5	.
``	I	've	done	what	I	came	*-2	to	do	*T*-1	''	at	Kidder	,	he	says	0	*T*-3	.
And	that	means	0	42-year-old	Michael	Carpenter	,	president	and	chief	executive	since	January	,	will	for	the	first	time	take	complete	control	of	Kidder	and	try	*-1	to	make	good	on	some	grandiose	plans	.
Mr.	Carpenter	says	0	he	will	return	Kidder	to	prominence	as	a	great	investment	bank	.
Wall	Street	is	understandably	skeptical	.
Through	the	first	nine	months	of	the	year	,	Kidder	ranks	a	distant	10th	among	underwriters	of	U.S.	stocks	and	bonds	,	with	a	2.8	%	market	share	,	up	slightly	from	2.5	%	in	the	year-earlier	period	,	according	to	Securities	Data	Co	.
It	's	quite	a	fall	from	the	early	1980s	,	when	Kidder	still	was	counted	*-1	as	an	investment-banking	powerhouse	*T*-2	.
Gary	S.	Goldstein	,	president	of	the	Whitney	Group	,	an	executive	search	firm	,	said	:	``	I	'd	like	*-1	to	see	-LRB-	Kidder	-RRB-	succeed	.
But	they	have	*-2	to	attract	good	senior	bankers	who	*T*-1	can	bring	in	the	business	from	day	one	.	''
In	1988	,	Kidder	eked	out	a	$	46	million	*U*	profit	,	mainly	because	of	severe	cost	cutting	.
Its	1,400-member	brokerage	operation	reported	an	estimated	$	5	million	*U*	loss	last	year	,	although	Kidder	expects	it	to	turn	a	profit	this	year	.
In	fact	,	Kidder	is	a	minor	player	in	just	about	every	business	0	it	does	*T*-1	except	computer-driven	program	trading	;	in	that	controversial	business	,	only	Morgan	Stanley	&	Co.	rivals	Kidder	.
But	even	that	niche	is	under	attack	,	as	several	Wall	Street	firms	pulled	back	from	program	trading	last	week	under	pressure	from	big	investors	.
Mr.	Carpenter	,	a	former	consulting-firm	executive	who	*T*-1	has	a	love	for	``	task	forces	,	''	says	0	he	has	done	a	``	complete	rethink	''	of	Kidder	in	recent	months	.
There	have	been	a	dizzying	parade	of	studies	of	the	firm	's	operations	.
More	than	20	new	managing	directors	and	senior	vice	presidents	have	been	hired	*-1	since	January	.
The	firm	's	brokerage	force	has	been	trimmed	*-1	and	its	mergers-and-acquisitions	staff	increased	*-2	to	a	record	55	people	.
Mr.	Carpenter	says	that	when	he	assumes	full	control	*T*-1	,	Kidder	will	finally	tap	the	resources	of	GE	.
One	of	GE	's	goals	when	it	bought	80	%	of	Kidder	in	1986	*T*-2	was	*	to	take	advantage	of	``	syngeries	''	between	Kidder	and	General	Electric	Capital	Corp.	,	GE	's	corporate-finance	unit	,	which	*T*-1	has	$	42	billion	*U*	in	assets	.
The	leveraged	buy-out	group	of	GE	Capital	now	reports	to	Mr.	Carpenter	.
So	far	,	instead	of	*-1	teaming	up	,	GE	Capital	staffers	and	Kidder	investment	bankers	have	bickered	.
Yet	,	says	0	*T*-2	Mr.	Carpenter	,	``	We	've	really	started	*-1	to	exploit	the	synergy	between	GE	Capital	and	Kidder	Peabody	.	''
The	units	have	worked	on	37	investment	banking	deals	this	year	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	,	though	not	all	of	them	have	panned	out	.
``	We	've	had	a	good	relationship	with	GE	,	which	*T*-1	is	the	first	time	0	you	could	say	that	*T*-2	--	uh	,	*	let	me	withdraw	that	.
It	's	been	a	steadily	improving	relationship	,	''	says	*T*-1	Mr.	Carpenter	.
Still	,	without	many	actual	deals	0	*	to	show	*T*-1	off	,	Kidder	is	left	*-2	to	stress	that	it	finally	has	``	a	team	''	in	place	,	and	that	everyone	works	harder	.
A	month	ago	,	the	firm	started	serving	dinner	at	about	7:30	each	night	;	about	50	to	60	of	the	350	people	in	the	investment	banking	operation	have	consistently	been	around	that	late	.
``	We	are	working	significantly	longer	and	harder	than	*?*	has	been	the	case	in	the	past	,	''	says	*T*-1	Scott	C.	Newquist	,	Kidder	's	head	of	investment	banking	since	June	.
Everywhere	,	Kidder	stresses	the	``	*	always	working	''	theme	.
A	new	in-house	magazine	,	Kidder	World	--	which	*T*-1	will	focus	on	the	firm	's	synergy	strategy	,	says	0	*T*-2	Mr.	Carpenter	--	confides	that	on	weekends	Mr.	Newquist	``	often	gets	value-added	ideas	while	*-3	flying	his	single-engine	Cessna	Centurion	on	the	way	to	Nantucket	.	''
The	firm	's	new	head	of	mergers	and	acquisitions	under	Mr.	Newquist	,	B.J.	Megargel	,	talks	of	the	opportunity	*	to	``	rebuild	a	franchise	''	at	Kidder	.
``	The	Kidder	name	is	one	of	only	six	or	seven	that	every	CEO	recognizes	*T*-2	as	a	viable	alternative	''	when	*-4	considering	a	merger	deal	*T*-3	,	he	says	*T*-1	.
Now	,	according	to	a	Kidder	World	story	about	Mr.	Megargel	,	all	0	the	firm	has	*-2	to	do	*T*-1	is	``	position	ourselves	more	in	the	deal	flow	.	''
With	investment	banking	as	Kidder	's	``	lead	business	,	''	where	do	Kidder	's	42-branch	brokerage	network	and	its	1,400	brokers	fit	in	*T*-1	?
Mr.	Carpenter	this	month	sold	off	Kidder	's	eight	brokerage	offices	in	Florida	and	Puerto	Rico	to	Merrill	Lynch	&	Co.	,	*-1	refueling	speculation	that	Kidder	is	getting	out	of	the	brokerage	business	entirely	.
Mr.	Carpenter	denies	the	speculation	.
*-1	To	answer	the	brokerage	question	,	Kidder	,	in	typical	fashion	,	completed	a	task-force	study	.
The	result	:	Kidder	will	focus	on	rich	individual	investors	and	small	companies	,	much	closer	to	the	clientele	of	Goldman	,	Sachs	&	Co.	than	a	serve-the-world	firm	like	Merrill	Lynch	or	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	Inc	.
Mr.	Carpenter	notes	that	these	types	of	investors	also	are	``	sophisticated	''	enough	*-1	not	to	complain	about	Kidder	's	aggressive	use	of	program	trading	.
As	part	of	the	upscale	push	,	Kidder	is	putting	brokers	through	a	20-week	training	course	,	*-1	turning	them	into	``	investment	counselors	''	with	knowledge	of	corporate	finance	.
They	will	get	``	new	and	improved	tools	0	*	to	sell	*T*-2	,	particularly	to	the	affluent	investor	,	''	says	*T*-1	brokerage	chief	Charles	V.	Sheehan	.
Theoretically	,	the	brokers	will	then	be	able	*-1	to	funnel	``	leads	''	on	corporate	finance	opportunities	to	Kidder	's	investment	bankers	,	*-1	possibly	easing	the	longstanding	tension	between	the	two	camps	.
However	,	skeptics	caution	that	this	kind	of	cross-pollination	between	brokers	and	investment	bankers	looks	great	on	paper	,	but	does	n't	always	happen	.
Kidder	competitors	are	n't	outwardly	hostile	to	the	firm	,	as	many	are	*?*	to	a	tough	competitor	like	Drexel	Burnham	Lambert	Inc.	that	*T*-1	does	n't	have	Kidder	's	long	history	.
However	,	competitors	say	that	Kidder	's	hiring	binge	involving	executive-level	staffers	,	some	with	multiple-year	contract	guarantees	,	could	backfire	unless	there	are	results	.
The	departing	Mr.	Cathcart	says	0	he	has	no	worries	about	Kidder	's	future	.
Mr.	Cathcart	,	who	*T*-2	will	return	to	the	Quaker	Oats	Co.	board	of	directors	,	in	addition	to	his	personal	ventures	,	is	credited	*-1	with	*-3	bringing	some	basic	budgeting	and	planning	discipline	to	traditionally	free-wheeling	Kidder	.
He	also	improved	the	firm	's	compliance	procedures	for	trading	.
Mr.	Cathcart	says	0	he	has	had	``	a	lot	of	fun	''	at	Kidder	,	*-1	adding	0	the	crack	about	his	being	a	``	tool-and-die	man	''	never	bothered	him	.
``	It	was	an	absolutely	marvelous	line	and	one	0	I	used	*T*-1	many	times	,	''	he	says	*T*-2	.
*-2	Smiling	broadly	when	he	talks	about	Mr.	Carpenter	*T*-3	,	Mr.	Cathcart	says	0	the	new	Kidder	chief	is	``	going	*-4	to	be	recognized	*-1	shortly	as	one	of	the	real	leaders	in	the	investment-banking	business	.	''
In	coming	years	,	Mr.	Cathcart	says	0	*T*-1	,	Kidder	is	``	gon	*-2	na	hum	.	''
Or	,	as	Mr.	Carpenter	,	*-2	again	drawing	on	his	consulting-firm	background	,	puts	it	:	``	We	're	ready	*-1	to	implement	at	this	point	.
UNDER	A	PROPOSAL	*ICH*-1	by	Democrats	*	to	expand	Individual	Retirement	Accounts	,	a	$	2,000	*U*	contribution	by	a	taxpayer	in	the	33	%	bracket	would	save	$	330	*U*	on	his	taxes	.
The	savings	was	given	*-1	incorrectly	in	Friday	's	edition	.
In	what	*T*-1	could	prove	a	major	addition	to	the	Philippines	'	foreign-investment	portfolio	,	a	Taiwanese	company	signed	a	$	180	million	*U*	construction	contract	*	to	build	the	centerpiece	of	a	planned	petrochemical	complex	.
Taiwan	's	USI	Far	East	Corp.	,	a	petrochemical	company	,	initialed	the	agreement	*ICH*-3	with	an	unidentified	Japanese	contractor	*	to	build	a	naphtha	cracker	,	according	to	Alson	Lee	,	who	*T*-1	heads	the	Philippine	company	set	up	*-2	*-4	to	build	and	operate	the	complex	.
Mr.	Lee	,	president	of	Luzon	Petrochemical	Corp.	,	said	0	the	contract	was	signed	*-1	Wednesday	in	Tokyo	with	USI	Far	East	officials	.
Contract	details	,	however	,	have	n't	been	made	*-1	public	.
The	complex	is	*-2	to	be	located	*-1	in	Batangas	,	about	70	miles	south	of	Manila	.
USI	Far	East	will	hold	a	60	%	stake	in	Luzon	Petrochemical	,	according	to	papers	signed	*	with	the	Philippine	government	's	Board	of	Investments	.
The	proposed	petrochemical	plant	would	use	naphtha	*-1	to	manufacture	the	petrochemicals	propylene	and	ethylene	and	their	resin	derivatives	,	polypropylene	and	polyethylene	.
These	are	the	raw	materials	used	*	in	*	making	plastics	.
The	contract	signing	represented	a	major	step	in	the	long-planned	petrochemical	project	.
At	an	estimated	$	360	million	*U*	,	the	project	would	represent	the	single	largest	foreign	investment	in	the	Philippines	since	President	Corazon	Aquino	took	office	in	February	1986	.
It	also	is	considered	*-1	critical	to	the	country	's	efforts	*	to	both	attract	other	investment	from	Taiwan	and	raise	heavy	industry	capabilities	.
The	project	has	been	in	and	out	of	the	pipeline	for	more	than	a	decade	.
However	,	workers	ca	n't	break	ground	until	legal	maneuvers	*	to	block	the	complex	*ICH*-1	are	resolved	*-2	,	moves	which	*T*-3	caused	the	signing	to	remain	questionable	up	to	the	last	moment	.
As	*	previously	reported	*-1	,	a	member	of	the	Philippines	'	House	of	Representatives	has	sued	*-2	to	stop	the	plant	.
The	legislator	,	Enrique	Garcia	,	had	actively	backed	the	plant	*NOT*	,	but	at	the	original	site	in	his	constituency	northwest	of	Manila	.
The	country	's	Supreme	Court	dismissed	the	suit	,	but	Mr.	Garcia	late	last	month	filed	for	a	reconsideration	.
In	addition	,	President	Aquino	has	yet	*-2	to	sign	into	law	a	bill	removing	a	stiff	48	%	tax	on	naphtha	,	the	principal	raw	material	0	*T*-3	to	be	used	*-1	in	the	cracker	.
However	,	at	a	news	conference	Thursday	,	Mrs.	Aquino	backed	the	project	and	said	0	her	government	was	attempting	*-1	to	soothe	the	feelings	of	residents	at	the	original	site	,	adjacent	to	the	government	's	major	petroleum	refinery	in	Bataan	province	.
``	We	have	tried	our	best	*-3	to	tell	the	people	in	Bataan	that	maybe	this	time	it	will	not	go	to	them	,	but	certainly	we	will	do	our	best	*-2	to	encourage	other	investors	to	go	to	their	province	,	''	Mrs.	Aquino	told	Manila-based	foreign	correspondents	*T*-1	.
The	project	appeared	*-1	to	be	on	the	rocks	earlier	this	month	when	the	other	major	partner	in	the	project	,	China	General	Plastics	Corp.	,	backed	out	*T*-2	.
China	General	Plastics	,	another	Taiwanese	petrochemical	manufacturer	,	was	*-1	to	have	a	40	%	stake	in	Luzon	Petrochemical	.
However	,	Mr.	Lee	said	that	USI	Far	East	is	confident	0	other	investors	will	take	up	the	slack	.
He	said	0	USI	Far	East	has	applied	to	both	the	Asian	Development	Bank	and	the	World	Bank	's	International	Finance	Corp.	for	financing	that	*T*-1	could	include	equity	stakes	.
Three	new	issues	begin	*-2	trading	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	today	,	and	one	began	*-1	trading	on	the	Nasdaq\/National	Market	System	last	week	.
On	the	Big	Board	,	Crawford	&	Co.	,	Atlanta	,	-LRB-	CFD	-RRB-	begins	*-1	trading	today	.
Crawford	evaluates	health	care	plans	,	manages	medical	and	disability	aspects	of	worker	's	compensation	injuries	and	is	involved	*-1	in	claims	adjustments	for	insurance	companies	.
Also	beginning	*-3	trading	*ICH*-1	today	on	the	Big	Board	are	*T*-2	El	Paso	Refinery	Limited	Partnership	,	El	Paso	,	Texas	,	-LRB-	ELP	-RRB-	and	Franklin	Multi-Income	Trust	,	San	Mateo	,	Calif.	,	-LRB-	FMI	-RRB-	.
El	Paso	owns	and	operates	a	petroleum	refinery	.
Franklin	is	a	closed-end	management	investment	company	.
On	the	Nasdaq	over-the-counter	system	,	Allied	Capital	Corp.	,	Washington	,	D.C.	,	-LRB-	ALII	-RRB-	began	*-1	trading	last	Thursday	.
Allied	Capital	is	a	closed-end	management	investment	company	that	*T*-1	will	operate	as	a	business	development	concern	.
THE	YALE	POLITICAL	UNION	does	n't	pay	an	honorarium	to	speakers	.
In	Thursday	's	edition	,	it	was	incorrectly	indicated	that	the	union	had	paid	a	fee	to	former	House	Speaker	Jim	Wright	.
President	Bush	insists	0	it	would	be	a	great	tool	for	*	curbing	the	budget	deficit	and	slicing	the	lard	out	of	government	programs	.
He	wants	it	now	.
Not	so	fast	,	says	*T*-1	Rep.	Mickey	Edwards	of	Oklahoma	,	a	fellow	Republican	.
``	I	consider	it	one	of	the	stupidest	ideas	of	the	20th	century	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
It	's	the	line-item	veto	,	a	procedure	that	*T*-1	would	allow	the	president	to	kill	individual	items	in	a	big	spending	bill	passed	*	by	Congress	without	*-2	vetoing	the	entire	bill	.
Whatever	one	thinks	*T*-1	of	the	idea	,	it	's	far	more	than	the	budgetary	gimmick	0	it	may	seem	*T*-2	at	first	glance	.
Rather	,	it	's	a	device	that	*T*-1	could	send	shock	waves	through	the	president	's	entire	relationship	with	Democrats	and	Republicans	alike	in	Congress	,	fundamentally	enhance	the	power	of	the	presidency	and	transform	the	way	0	the	government	does	its	business	*T*-3	.
President	Bush	badly	wants	a	line-item	veto	and	has	long	called	for	a	law	giving	it	to	the	president	.
Now	the	White	House	is	declaring	that	he	might	not	rely	on	Congress	--	which	*T*-1	has	n't	shown	any	willingness	*	to	surrender	such	authority	--	*-3	to	pass	the	line-item	veto	law	0	he	seeks	*T*-2	.
White	House	spokesmen	last	week	said	0	Mr.	Bush	is	considering	*-2	simply	declaring	that	the	Constitution	gives	him	the	power	,	exercising	a	line-item	veto	and	inviting	a	court	challenge	0	*	to	decide	whether	he	has	the	right	*T*-1	.
Although	that	may	sound	like	an	arcane	maneuver	of	little	interest	outside	Washington	,	it	would	set	off	a	political	earthquake	.
``	The	ramifications	are	enormous	,	''	says	*T*-2	Rep.	Don	Edwards	,	a	California	Democrat	who	*T*-1	is	a	senior	member	of	the	House	Judiciary	Committee	.
``	It	's	a	real	face-to-face	arm	wrestling	challenge	to	Congress	.	''
White	House	aides	know	0	it	's	a	step	that	*T*-2	ca	n't	be	taken	*-1	lightly	--	and	for	that	reason	,	the	president	may	back	down	from	*-3	launching	a	test	case	this	year	.
Some	senior	advisers	argue	that	with	further	fights	over	a	capital-gains	tax	cut	and	a	budget-reduction	bill	looming	,	Mr.	Bush	already	has	enough	pending	confrontations	with	Congress	.
They	prefer	*-1	to	put	off	the	line-item	veto	until	at	least	next	year	.
Still	,	Mr.	Bush	and	some	other	aides	are	strongly	drawn	*-1	to	the	idea	of	*-2	trying	out	a	line-item	veto	.
The	issue	arose	last	week	when	Vice	President	Dan	Quayle	told	an	audience	in	Chicago	that	Mr.	Bush	was	looking	for	a	test	case	*T*-1	.
White	House	Press	Secretary	Marlin	Fitzwater	confirmed	that	Mr.	Bush	was	interested	in	the	idea	,	but	cautioned	that	there	was	n't	a	firm	decision	*	to	try	it	.
Mr.	Bush	,	former	President	Reagan	and	a	host	of	conservative	activists	have	been	arguing	that	a	line-item	veto	would	go	a	long	way	in	*	restoring	discipline	to	the	budget	process	.
They	maintain	that	a	president	needs	the	ability	*	to	surgically	remove	pork-barrel	spending	projects	that	*T*-2	are	attached	*-1	to	big	omnibus	spending	bills	.
Those	bills	ca	n't	easily	be	vetoed	*-1	in	their	entirety	because	they	often	are	needed	*-2	to	keep	the	government	operating	.
Conservatives	note	that	43	governors	have	the	line-item	veto	0	*	to	use	*T*-1	on	state	budgets	.
More	provocatively	,	some	conservative	legal	theorists	have	begun	*-1	arguing	that	Mr.	Bush	does	n't	need	*-2	to	wait	for	a	law	giving	him	the	veto	because	the	power	already	is	implicit	in	the	Constitution	.
They	base	their	argument	on	a	clause	buried	*	in	Article	I	,	Section	7	,	of	the	Constitution	that	*T*-1	states	:	``	Every	order	,	resolution	,	or	vote	to	which	the	concurrence	of	the	Senate	and	House	of	Representatives	may	be	necessary	*T*-2	-LRB-	except	on	a	question	of	adjournment	-RRB-	shall	be	presented	*-3	to	the	President	of	the	United	States	;	and	before	the	same	shall	take	effect	,	shall	be	approved	*-3	by	him	or	...	disapproved	*-3	by	him	...	.	''
This	clause	,	they	argue	0	*T*-1	,	is	designed	*-2	*-3	to	go	beyond	an	earlier	clause	specifying	that	the	president	can	veto	a	``	bill	,	''	and	is	broad	enough	*	to	allow	him	to	strike	out	items	and	riders	within	bills	.
Senate	Minority	Leader	Robert	Dole	-LRB-	R.	,	Kan.	-RRB-	,	for	one	,	accepts	this	argument	and	earlier	this	year	publicly	urged	Mr.	Bush	``	*-1	to	use	the	line-item	veto	and	allow	the	courts	to	decide	whether	or	not	it	is	constitutional	.	''
There	's	little	doubt	that	such	a	move	would	be	immediately	challenged	*-1	in	court	--	and	that	it	would	quickly	make	its	way	to	the	Supreme	Court	*-2	to	be	ultimately	resolved	*-3	.
``	It	's	a	major	issue	,	and	they	would	n't	want	*-2	to	leave	it	at	a	lower	level	,	''	says	*T*-3	Stephen	Glazier	,	a	New	York	attorney	whose	writings	*T*-1	have	been	instrumental	in	*	pushing	the	idea	that	a	president	already	has	a	line-item	veto	.
Rep.	Edwards	,	the	California	Democrat	,	is	one	who	*T*-1	pledges	that	he	would	immediately	challenge	Mr.	Bush	in	the	courts	,	*-2	arguing	0	a	line-item	veto	would	expand	a	president	's	powers	far	beyond	anything	0	the	framers	of	the	Constitution	had	*T*-3	in	mind	.
``	It	puts	this	president	in	the	legislative	business	,	''	he	declares	*T*-1	.
``	That	's	not	what	our	fathers	had	*T*-1	in	mind	.	''
In	addition	to	*-3	giving	a	president	powers	*	to	rewrite	spending	bills	meant	*	to	be	written	*-1	in	Congress	,	Rep.	Edwards	argues	0	*T*-2	,	a	line-item	veto	would	allow	the	chief	executive	to	blackmail	lawmakers	.
He	notes	that	,	as	a	lawmaker	from	the	San	Francisco	area	,	he	fights	each	year	*-1	to	preserve	federal	funds	for	the	Bay	Area	Rapid	Transit	system	.
If	a	president	had	a	line-item	veto	and	wanted	*-1	to	force	him	to	support	a	controversial	foreign-policy	initiative	,	Rep.	Edwards	says	0	*T*-2	,	the	president	could	call	and	declare	that	he	would	single-handedly	kill	the	BART	funds	unless	the	congressman	``	shapes	up	''	on	the	foreign-policy	issue	.
Proponents	maintain	that	a	president	would	choose	*-1	to	use	a	line-item	veto	more	judiciously	than	that	.
But	there	may	be	another	problem	with	the	device	:	Despite	all	the	political	angst	0	it	would	cause	*T*-1	,	it	might	n't	be	effective	in	*	cutting	the	deficit	.
Big	chunks	of	the	government	budget	,	like	the	entitlement	programs	of	Social	Security	and	Medicare	,	would	n't	be	affected	*-1	.
Governors	have	found	that	they	have	*-1	to	use	the	device	sparingly	*-1	to	maintain	political	comity	.
And	it	*EXP*-4	is	n't	even	clear	that	some	pork-barrel	projects	can	be	hit	*-1	with	a	line-item	veto	because	they	tend	*-3	to	be	listed	*-2	in	informal	conference	reports	accompanying	spending	bills	rather	than	in	the	official	bills	themselves	.
Still	,	proponents	contend	that	the	veto	would	have	what	Mr.	Glazier	calls	*T*-1	an	important	``	chilling	effect	''	on	all	manner	of	appropriations	bills	.
Lawmakers	,	they	say	0	*T*-1	,	would	avoid	*-3	putting	many	spending	projects	into	legislation	in	the	first	place	for	fear	of	the	embarrassment	of	*	having	them	singled	*-2	out	for	a	line-item	veto	later	.
Whatever	the	outcome	of	a	test	case	*T*-4	,	President	Bush	would	have	*-2	to	move	cautiously	becase	the	very	attempt	would	``	antagonize	not	just	Democrats	but	Republicans	,	''	says	*T*-3	Louis	Fisher	,	a	scholar	at	the	Congressional	Research	Service	who	*T*-1	specializes	in	executive-legislative	relations	.
Republicans	have	as	much	interest	as	Democrats	in	``	the	way	0	the	system	works	*T*-1	,	''	he	notes	0	*T*-2	.
Indeed	,	although	a	majority	of	Republican	lawmakers	favor	a	line-item	veto	,	some	,	*-1	ranging	from	liberal	Oregon	Sen.	Mark	Hatfield	to	conservative	Rep.	Edwards	are	opposed	.

This	has	n't	been	Kellogg	Co.	's	year	.
The	oat-bran	craze	has	cost	the	world	's	largest	cereal	maker	market	share	.
The	company	's	president	quit	suddenly	.
And	now	Kellogg	is	indefinitely	suspending	work	on	what	*T*-1	was	*-2	to	be	a	$	1	billion	*U*	cereal	plant	.
The	company	said	0	it	was	delaying	construction	because	of	current	market	conditions	.
But	the	Memphis	,	Tenn.	,	facility	was	n't	*-1	to	begin	*-2	turning	out	product	until	1993	,	so	the	decision	may	reveal	a	more	pessimistic	long-term	outlook	as	well	.
Kellogg	,	which	*T*-1	has	n't	been	as	successful	in	*	capitalizing	on	the	public	's	health-oriented	desire	for	oat	bran	as	rival	General	Mills	Inc.	,	has	been	losing	share	in	the	$	6	billion	*U*	ready-to-eat	cereal	market	.
Kellogg	's	current	share	is	believed	*-1	to	be	slightly	under	40	%	while	General	Mills	'	share	is	about	27	%	.
*-2	Led	*-1	by	its	oat-based	Cheerios	line	,	General	Mills	has	gained	an	estimated	2	%	share	so	far	this	year	,	mostly	at	the	expense	of	Kellogg	.
Each	share	point	is	worth	about	$	60	million	*U*	in	sales	.
Analysts	say	0	much	of	Kellogg	's	erosion	has	been	in	such	core	brands	as	Corn	Flakes	,	Rice	Krispies	and	Frosted	Flakes	,	which	*T*-1	represent	nearly	one-third	of	its	sales	volume	.
Kellogg	is	so	anxious	*-1	to	turn	around	Corn	Flakes	sales	that	it	soon	will	begin	*-3	selling	boxes	for	as	little	as	99	cents	,	trade	sources	say	0	*T*-2	.
``	Cheerios	and	Honey	Nut	Cheerios	have	eaten	away	sales	normally	going	to	Kellogg	's	corn-based	lines	simply	because	they	are	made	*-1	of	oats	,	''	says	*T*-2	Merrill	Lynch	food	analyst	William	Maguire	.
``	They	are	not	a	happy	group	of	people	at	Battle	Creek	right	now	.	''
Kellogg	is	based	*-1	in	Battle	Creek	,	Mich.	,	a	city	that	*T*-2	calls	itself	the	breakfast	capital	of	the	world	.
Another	analyst	,	John	C.	Maxwell	Jr.	of	Wheat	,	First	Securities	in	Richmond	,	Va.	,	recently	went	to	a	``	sell	''	recommendation	on	Kellogg	stock	,	which	*T*-1	closed	Friday	at	$	71.75	*U*	,	down	75	cents	,	in	New	York	Stock	Exchange	composite	trading	.
``	I	do	n't	think	0	Kellogg	can	get	back	to	40	%	this	year	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
``	Kellogg	's	main	problem	is	life	style	.
People	are	reading	the	boxes	and	deciding	0	they	want	something	that	*T*-1	's	`	healthy	'	for	you	--	oats	,	bran	.	''
Mr.	Maxwell	said	0	he	would	n't	be	surprised	if	,	over	the	next	two	years	or	so	,	General	Mills	'	share	increased	to	30	%	or	more	.
In	*-1	announcing	the	plant	delay	,	Kellogg	Chairman	William	E.	LaMothe	said	,	``	Cereal	volume	growth	in	the	U.S.	has	not	met	our	expectations	for	1989	.	''
He	said	0	construction	would	n't	resume	until	market	conditions	warrant	it	.
Kellogg	indicated	that	it	has	room	0	*	to	grow	*T*-1	without	*-2	adding	facilities	.
The	company	has	five	other	U.S.	plants	,	including	a	modern	facility	at	its	Battle	Creek	headquarters	known	*	as	Building	100	,	which	*T*-1	is	*-2	to	add	bran-processing	and	rice-processing	capacity	next	year	.
General	Mills	,	meanwhile	,	finds	itself	constrained	*-1	from	*-2	boosting	sales	further	because	its	plants	are	operating	at	capacity	.
A	large	plant	in	Covington	,	Ga.	,	is	*-1	to	come	on	line	next	year	.
A	Kellogg	officer	,	who	*T*-2	asked	not	*-3	to	be	named	*-1	,	said	0	the	Memphis	project	was	``	pulled	*-4	in	for	a	reconsideration	of	costs	,	''	an	indication	that	the	ambitious	plans	might	be	scaled	*-5	back	in	any	future	construction	.
Initial	cost	estimates	for	the	plant	,	which	*T*-2	was	*-3	to	have	been	built	*-1	in	phases	,	ranged	from	$	1	billion	*U*	to	$	1.2	billion	*U*	.
A	company	spokesman	said	0	it	*EXP*-2	was	``	possible	,	but	highly	unlikely	,	''	that	the	plant	might	never	be	built	*-1	.
``	As	we	regain	our	leadership	level	where	we	have	been	*T*-3	,	and	as	we	continue	*-1	to	put	new	products	into	the	marketplace	and	need	additional	capacity	,	we	will	look	at	*-4	resuming	our	involvement	with	our	plan	,	''	he	said	*T*-2	.
The	new	facility	was	*-1	to	have	been	the	world	's	most	advanced	cereal	manufacturing	plant	,	and	Kellogg	's	largest	construction	project	.
The	company	had	retained	the	Fluor	Daniel	unit	of	Fluor	Corp.	as	general	contractor	.
But	in	recent	weeks	,	construction-industry	sources	reported	that	early	preparation	work	was	slowing	at	the	185-acre	site	.
Subcontractors	said	0	they	were	told	*-1	that	equipment	orders	would	be	delayed	*-2	.
Fluor	Daniel	already	has	reassigned	most	of	its	work	crew	,	the	sources	said	0	*T*-1	.
Last	Friday	's	announcement	was	the	first	official	word	that	the	project	was	in	trouble	and	that	the	company	's	plans	for	a	surge	in	market	share	may	have	been	overly	optimistic	.
Until	recently	,	Kellogg	had	been	telling	its	sales	force	and	Wall	Street	that	by	1992	it	intended	*-1	to	achieve	a	50	%	share	of	market	,	measured	*	in	dollar	volume	.
Although	he	called	current	market	conditions	``	highly	competitive	,	''	Mr.	LaMothe	,	Kellogg	's	chairman	and	chief	executive	officer	,	forecast	an	earnings	increase	for	the	full	year	.
Last	year	,	the	company	earned	$	480.4	million	*U*	,	or	$	3.90	*U*	a	share	,	on	sales	of	$	4.3	billion	*U*	.
As	*	expected	*-1	,	Kellogg	reported	lower	third-quarter	earnings	.
Net	fell	16	%	to	$	123.1	million	*U*	,	or	$	1.02	*U*	a	share	,	from	$	145.7	million	*U*	,	or	$	1.18	*U*	a	share	.
Sales	rose	4.8	%	to	$	1.20	billion	*U*	from	$	1.14	billion	*U*	.
The	company	had	a	one-time	charge	of	$	14.8	million	*U*	in	the	latest	quarter	*-1	covering	the	disposition	of	certain	assets	.
The	company	would	n't	elaborate	,	*-1	citing	competitive	reasons	.
PARKER	HANNIFIN	Corp.	,	which	*T*-1	is	selling	three	automotive	replacement	parts	divisions	,	said	0	it	will	retain	its	Automotive	Connectors	and	Cliff	Impact	divisions	.
The	divisions	that	Parker	Hannifin	is	retaining	*T*-1	were	n't	mentioned	*-2	in	Thursday	's	edition	.
The	following	were	among	Friday	's	offerings	and	pricings	in	the	U.S.	and	non-U.S.	capital	markets	,	with	terms	and	syndicate	manager	,	as	*-1	compiled	*-2	by	Dow	Jones	Capital	Markets	Report	:

The	Singapore	and	Kuala	Lumpur	stock	exchanges	are	bracing	for	a	turbulent	separation	,	following	Malaysian	Finance	Minister	Daim	Zainuddin	's	long-awaited	announcement	that	the	exchanges	will	sever	ties	.
On	Friday	,	Datuk	Daim	added	spice	to	an	otherwise	unremarkable	address	on	Malaysia	's	proposed	budget	for	1990	by	*-3	ordering	the	Kuala	Lumpur	Stock	Exchange	``	*-1	to	take	appropriate	action	immediately	''	*-2	to	cut	its	links	with	the	Stock	Exchange	of	Singapore	.
The	delisting	of	Malaysian-based	companies	from	the	Singapore	exchange	may	not	be	a	smooth	process	,	analysts	say	0	*T*-1	.
Though	the	split	has	long	been	expected	*-1	,	the	exchanges	are	n't	fully	prepared	*-2	*-3	to	go	their	separate	ways	.
The	finance	minister	's	order	was	n't	sparked	*-1	by	a	single	event	and	does	n't	indicate	a	souring	in	relations	between	the	neighboring	countries	.
Rather	,	the	two	closely	linked	exchanges	have	been	drifting	apart	for	some	years	,	with	a	nearly	five-year-old	moratorium	on	new	dual	listings	,	separate	and	different	listing	requirements	,	differing	trading	and	settlement	guidelines	and	diverging	national-policy	aims	.
QUANTUM	CHEMICAL	Corp.	's	plant	in	Morris	,	Ill.	,	is	expected	*-1	to	resume	production	in	early	1990	.
The	year	was	misstated	*-1	in	Friday	's	editions	.
Italy	's	trade	deficit	narrowed	to	2.007	trillion	lire	-LRB-	$	1.49	billion	*U*	-RRB-	in	September	from	2.616	trillion	lire	a	year	earlier	,	the	state	statistical	office	Istat	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	deficit	was	466	billion	lire	in	August	.
For	the	first	nine	months	,	the	trade	deficit	was	14.933	trillion	lire	,	compared	with	10.485	trillion	lire	in	the	year-earlier	period	.
Istat	said	0	the	statistics	are	provisional	and	are	n't	seasonally	adjusted	*-1	.
Imports	rose	11	%	to	18.443	trillion	lire	in	September	from	a	year	earlier	,	while	exports	rose	17	%	to	16.436	trillion	lire	.
In	the	nine	months	,	imports	rose	20	%	to	155.039	trillion	lire	,	while	exports	grew	18	%	to	140.106	trillion	lire	.
Import	values	are	calculated	*-1	on	a	cost	,	insurance	and	freight	-LRB-	c.i.f	.	-RRB-	basis	,	while	exports	are	accounted	for	*-2	on	a	free-on-board	-LRB-	f.o.b	.	-RRB-	basis	.
As	competition	heats	up	in	Spain	's	crowded	bank	market	,	Banco	Exterior	de	Espana	is	seeking	*-1	to	shed	its	image	of	a	state-owned	bank	and	move	into	new	activities	.
Under	the	direction	of	its	new	chairman	,	Francisco	Luzon	,	Spain	's	seventh	largest	bank	is	undergoing	a	tough	restructuring	that	analysts	say	0	*T*-1	may	be	the	first	step	toward	the	bank	's	privatization	.
The	state-owned	industrial	holding	company	Instituto	Nacional	de	Industria	and	the	Bank	of	Spain	jointly	hold	a	13.94	%	stake	in	Banco	Exterior	.
The	government	directly	owns	51.4	%	and	Factorex	,	a	financial	services	company	,	holds	8.42	%	.
The	rest	is	listed	*-1	on	Spanish	stock	exchanges	.
Some	analysts	are	concerned	,	however	,	that	Banco	Exterior	may	have	waited	too	long	*-1	to	diversify	from	its	traditional	export-related	activities	.
*	Catching	up	with	commercial	competitors	in	retail	banking	and	financial	services	,	they	argue	0	*T*-1	,	will	be	difficult	,	particularly	if	market	conditions	turn	sour	.
If	that	proves	true	,	analysts	say	0	Banco	Exterior	could	be	a	prime	partner	--	or	even	a	takeover	target	--	for	either	a	Spanish	or	foreign	bank	seeking	*	to	increase	its	market	share	after	1992	,	when	the	European	Community	plans	*-3	to	dismantle	financial	barriers	*T*-4	.
With	700	branches	in	Spain	and	12	banking	subsidiaries	,	five	branches	and	12	representative	offices	abroad	,	the	Banco	Exterior	group	has	a	lot	0	*	to	offer	a	potential	suitor	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Luzon	and	his	team	,	however	,	say	0	they	are	n't	interested	in	a	merger	.
Instead	,	they	are	working	*-1	to	transform	Banco	Exterior	into	an	efficient	bank	by	the	end	of	1992	.
``	I	want	this	to	be	a	model	of	the	way	0	a	public-owned	company	should	be	run	*-1	*T*-3	,	''	Mr.	Luzon	says	*T*-2	.
Banco	Exterior	was	created	*-1	in	1929	*-1	to	provide	subsidized	credits	for	Spanish	exports	.
The	market	for	export	financing	was	liberalized	*-1	in	the	mid-1980s	,	however	,	*	forcing	the	bank	to	face	competition	.
At	the	same	time	,	many	of	Spain	's	traditional	export	markets	in	Latin	America	and	other	developing	areas	faced	a	sharp	decline	in	economic	growth	.
As	a	result	,	the	volume	of	Banco	Exterior	's	export	credit	portfolio	plunged	from	824	billion	pesatas	-LRB-	$	7.04	billion	*U*	-RRB-	as	of	Dec.	31	,	1986	,	to	its	current	522	billion	pesetas	.
The	other	two	main	pillars	of	Banco	Exterior	's	traditional	business	--	wholesale	banking	and	foreign	currency	trading	--	also	began	*-1	to	crumble	under	the	weight	of	heavy	competition	and	changing	client	needs	.
The	bank	was	hamstrung	*-1	in	its	efforts	*	to	face	the	challenges	of	a	changing	market	by	its	links	to	the	government	,	analysts	say	0	*T*-2	.
Until	Mr.	Luzon	took	the	helm	last	November	,	Banco	Exterior	was	run	*-1	by	politicians	who	*T*-2	lacked	either	the	skills	*RNR*-3	or	the	will	*RNR*-3	0	*	to	introduce	innovative	changes	*T*-4	.
But	Mr.	Luzon	has	moved	swiftly	*-1	to	streamline	bureaucracy	,	cut	costs	,	increase	capital	and	build	up	new	areas	of	business	.
``	We	've	got	a	lot	0	*	to	do	*T*-2	,	''	he	acknowledged	*T*-1	.
``	We	've	got	*-1	to	move	quickly	.	''
In	Mr.	Luzon	's	first	year	,	the	bank	eliminated	800	jobs	.
Now	it	says	0	it	'll	trim	another	1,200	jobs	over	the	next	three	to	four	years	.
The	bank	employs	8,000	people	in	Spain	and	2,000	abroad	.
*-1	To	strengthen	its	capital	base	,	Banco	Exterior	this	year	issued	$	105	million	*U*	in	subordinated	debt	,	launched	two	rights	issues	and	sold	stock	held	*	in	its	treasury	to	small	investors	.
The	bank	is	now	aggressively	marketing	retail	services	at	its	domestic	branches	.
Last	year	's	drop	in	export	credit	was	partially	offset	*-1	by	a	15	%	surge	in	lending	to	individuals	and	small	and	medium-sized	companies	.
Though	Spain	has	an	excess	of	banks	,	analysts	say	0	the	country	still	has	one	of	the	most	profitable	markets	in	Europe	,	which	*T*-1	will	aid	Banco	Exterior	with	the	tough	tasks	0	it	faces	*T*-2	ahead	.
Expansion	plans	also	include	acquisitions	in	growing	foreign	markets	.
The	bank	says	0	it	's	interested	in	*-1	purchasing	banks	in	Morocco	,	Portugal	and	Puerto	Rico	.
But	the	bank	's	retail	activities	in	Latin	America	are	likely	*-1	to	be	cut	*-2	back	.
Banco	Exterior	was	one	of	the	last	banks	0	*T*-1	to	create	a	brokerage	house	before	the	four	Spanish	stock	exchanges	underwent	sweeping	changes	in	July	.
The	late	start	may	be	a	handicap	for	the	bank	as	Spain	continues	*-1	to	open	up	its	market	to	foreign	competition	.
But	Mr.	Luzon	contends	that	the	experienced	team	0	he	brought	*T*-1	with	him	from	Banco	Bilbao	Vizcaya	,	where	he	was	formerly	director	general	*T*-2	,	will	whip	the	bank	's	capital	market	division	into	shape	by	the	end	of	1992	.
The	bank	also	says	0	it	'll	use	its	international	network	*-1	to	channel	investment	from	London	,	Frankfurt	,	Zurich	and	Paris	into	the	Spanish	stock	exchanges	.
General	Motors	Corp.	's	general	counsel	hopes	*-1	to	cut	the	number	of	outside	law	firms	0	the	auto	maker	uses	*T*-2	from	about	700	to	200	within	two	years	.
Harry	J.	Pearce	,	named	*	general	counsel	in	May	1987	,	says	0	the	reduction	is	a	cost-cutting	measure	and	an	effort	*	to	let	the	No.	1	auto	maker	's	134-lawyer	in-house	legal	department	take	on	matters	0	it	is	better	equipped	and	trained	*-2	to	handle	*T*-1	.
GM	trimmed	about	40	firms	from	its	approved	local	counsel	list	,	Mr.	Pearce	says	0	*T*-1	.
The	move	is	consistent	with	a	trend	for	corporate	legal	staffs	to	do	more	work	in-house	,	instead	of	*-1	farming	it	out	to	law	firms	.
Mr.	Pearce	set	up	GM	's	first	in-house	litigation	group	in	May	with	four	lawyers	,	all	former	assistant	U.S.	attorneys	with	extensive	trial	experience	.
He	intends	*-1	to	add	to	the	litigation	staff	.
Among	the	types	of	cases	0	the	in-house	litigators	handle	*T*-2	are	*T*-1	disputes	involving	companies	doing	business	with	GM	and	product-related	actions	,	including	one	in	which	a	driver	is	suing	GM	for	damages	resulting	from	an	accident	*T*-3	.
Mr.	Pearce	has	also	encouraged	his	staff	to	work	more	closely	with	GM	's	technical	staffs	*-1	to	help	prevent	future	litigation	.
GM	lawyers	have	been	working	with	technicians	*-2	to	develop	more	uniform	welding	procedures	--	the	way	0	a	vehicle	is	welded	*-1	*T*-3	has	a	lot	0	*	to	do	*T*-4	with	its	durability	.
The	lawyers	also	monitor	suits	*-2	to	identify	specific	automobile	parts	that	*T*-1	cause	the	biggest	legal	problems	.
Mr.	Pearce	says	law	firms	with	the	best	chance	of	*	retaining	or	winning	business	with	GM	will	be	those	providing	the	highest-quality	service	at	the	best	cost	--	*-1	echoing	similar	directives	from	GM	's	auto	operations	to	suppliers	.
This	does	n't	necessarily	mean	0	larger	firms	have	an	advantage	;	Mr.	Pearce	said	0	GM	works	with	a	number	of	smaller	firms	0	it	regards	*T*-1	highly	.
Mr.	Pearce	has	shaken	up	GM	's	legal	staff	by	*-2	eliminating	all	titles	and	establishing	several	new	functions	,	including	a	special-projects	group	that	*T*-1	has	made	films	on	safety	and	drunk	driving	.
FEDERAL	PROSECUTORS	are	concluding	fewer	criminal	cases	with	trials	.
That	's	a	finding	of	a	new	study	of	the	Justice	Department	by	researchers	at	Syracuse	University	.
David	Burnham	,	one	of	the	authors	,	says	0	fewer	trials	probably	means	a	growing	number	of	plea	bargains	.
In	1980	,	18	%	of	federal	prosecutions	concluded	at	trial	;	in	1987	,	only	9	%	did	*?*	.
The	study	covered	11	major	U.S.	attorneys	'	offices	--	including	those	in	Manhattan	and	Brooklyn	,	N.Y.	,	and	New	Jersey	--	from	1980	to	1987	.
The	Justice	Department	rejected	the	implication	that	its	prosecutors	are	currently	more	willing	*-1	to	plea	bargain	.
``	Our	felony	caseloads	have	been	consistent	for	20	years	,	''	with	about	15	%	of	all	prosecutions	going	to	trial	,	a	department	spokeswoman	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	discrepancy	is	somewhat	perplexing	in	that	the	Syracuse	researchers	said	0	they	based	their	conclusions	on	government	statistics	.
``	One	possible	explanation	for	this	decline	''	in	*	taking	cases	to	trial	,	says	0	*T*-1	Mr.	Burnham	,	``	is	that	the	number	of	defendants	being	charged	*	with	crimes	by	all	U.S.	attorneys	has	substantially	increased	.	''
In	1980	,	the	study	says	0	*T*-1	,	prosecutors	surveyed	*	filed	charges	against	25	defendants	for	each	100,000	people	aged	18	years	and	older	.
In	1987	,	prosecutors	filed	against	35	defendants	for	every	100,000	adults	.
Another	finding	from	the	study	:	Prosecutors	set	significantly	different	priorities	.
The	Manhattan	U.S.	attorney	's	office	stressed	criminal	cases	from	1980	to	1987	,	*-1	averaging	43	for	every	100,000	adults	.
But	the	New	Jersey	U.S.	attorney	averaged	16	.
On	the	civil	side	,	the	Manhattan	prosecutor	filed	an	average	of	only	11	cases	for	every	100,000	adults	during	the	same	period	;	the	San	Francisco	U.S.	attorney	averaged	79	.
The	study	is	*-1	to	provide	reporters	,	academic	experts	and	others	raw	data	on	which	*	to	base	further	inquiries	*T*-2	.
IMELDA	MARCOS	asks	for	dismissal	,	says	0	she	was	kidnapped	*-1	.
The	former	first	lady	of	the	Philippines	,	asked	a	federal	court	in	Manhattan	*-2	to	dismiss	an	indictment	against	her	,	*-3	claiming	among	other	things	,	that	she	was	abducted	*-1	from	her	homeland	.
Mrs.	Marcos	and	her	late	husband	,	former	Philippines	President	Ferdinand	Marcos	,	were	charged	*-1	with	*-2	embezzling	more	than	$	100	million	*U*	from	that	country	and	then	fraudulently	concealing	much	of	the	money	through	purchases	of	prime	real	estate	in	Manhattan	.
Mrs.	Marcos	's	attorneys	asked	federal	Judge	John	F.	Keenan	*-1	to	give	them	access	to	all	U.S.	documents	about	her	alleged	abduction	.
The	U.S.	attorney	's	office	,	in	documents	0	it	filed	*T*-2	in	response	,	said	0	Mrs.	Marcos	was	making	the	``	fanciful	--	and	factually	unsupported	--	claim	that	she	was	kidnapped	*-1	into	this	country	''	in	order	*-3	to	obtain	classified	material	in	the	case	.
The	office	also	said	0	Mrs.	Marcos	and	her	husband	were	n't	brought	*-2	to	the	U.S.	against	their	will	after	Mr.	Marcos	was	ousted	*-1	as	president	.
The	prosecutor	quoted	statements	from	the	Marcoses	in	which	they	said	0	they	were	in	this	country	at	the	invitation	of	President	Reagan	and	that	they	were	enjoying	the	hospitality	of	the	U.S.	*T*-1	.
Lawyers	for	Mrs.	Marcos	say	that	because	she	was	taken	*-1	to	the	U.S.	against	her	wishes	,	the	federal	court	lacks	jurisdiction	in	the	case	.
THE	FEDERAL	COURT	of	appeals	in	Manhattan	ruled	that	the	dismissal	of	a	1980	indictment	against	former	Bank	of	Crete	owner	George	Koskotas	should	be	reconsidered	*-1	.
The	indictment	,	which	*T*-1	was	sealed	*-2	and	apparently	forgotten	*-2	by	investigators	until	1987	,	charges	Mr.	Koskotas	and	three	others	with	tax	fraud	and	other	violations	.
He	made	numerous	trips	to	the	U.S.	in	the	early	1980s	,	but	was	n't	arrested	*-2	until	1987	when	he	showed	up	as	a	guest	of	then-Vice	President	George	Bush	at	a	government	function	*T*-1	.
A	federal	judge	in	Manhattan	threw	out	the	indictment	,	*-1	finding	that	the	seven-year	delay	violated	the	defendant	's	constitutional	right	to	a	speedy	trial	.
The	appeals	court	,	however	,	said	0	the	judge	did	n't	adequately	consider	whether	the	delay	would	actually	hurt	the	chances	of	a	fair	trial	.
Mr.	Koskotas	is	fighting	extradition	proceedings	that	*T*-2	would	return	him	to	Greece	,	where	he	is	charged	*-1	with	*-4	embezzling	more	than	$	250	million	*U*	from	the	Bank	of	Crete	*T*-3	.
His	attorney	could	n't	be	reached	*-1	for	comment	.
PRO	BONO	VOLUNTARISM	:	In	an	effort	*	to	stave	off	a	plan	that	*T*-1	would	require	all	lawyers	in	New	York	state	to	provide	twenty	hours	of	free	legal	aid	a	year	,	the	state	bar	recommended	an	alternative	program	0	*T*-2	to	increase	voluntary	participation	in	pro	bono	programs	.
The	state	bar	association	's	policy	making	body	,	the	House	of	Delegate	,	voted	Saturday	*-1	to	ask	Chief	Judge	Sol	Wachtler	*-2	to	give	the	bar	's	voluntary	program	three	years	0	*	to	prove	its	effectiveness	before	*-4	considering	mandatory	pro	bono	*T*-3	.
``	We	believe	0	our	suggested	plan	is	more	likely	*-2	to	improve	the	availability	of	quality	legal	service	to	the	poor	than	is	the	proposed	mandatory	pro	bono	plan	*?*	and	will	achieve	that	objective	without	the	divisiveness	,	distraction	,	administrative	burdens	and	possible	failure	that	we	fear	0	*T*-3	would	accompany	an	attempt	*	to	impose	a	mandatory	plan	,	''	said	*T*-4	Justin	L.

DALLAS	AND	HOUSTON	law	firms	merge	:	Jackson	&	Walker	,	a	130-lawyer	firm	in	Dallas	and	Datson	&	Scofield	,	a	70-lawyer	firm	in	Houston	said	0	they	have	agreed	in	principle	*-1	to	merge	.
The	consolidated	firm	,	which	*T*-1	would	rank	among	the	10	largest	in	Texas	,	would	operate	under	the	name	Jackson	&	Walker	.
The	merger	must	be	formally	approved	*-2	by	the	partners	of	both	firms	but	is	expected	*-2	to	be	completed	*-1	by	year	end	.

*	PILING	ON	?
*-1	Piggybacking	on	government	assertions	that	General	Electric	Co.	may	have	covered	up	fraudulent	billings	to	the	Pentagon	,	two	shareholders	have	filed	a	civil	racketeering	suit	against	the	company	.
The	suit	was	filed	*-1	by	plaintiffs	'	securities	lawyer	Richard	D.	Greenfield	in	U.S.	District	Court	in	Philadelphia	.
He	seeks	damages	from	the	company	's	15	directors	on	grounds	that	they	either	``	participated	in	*RNR*-1	or	condoned	*RNR*-1	the	illegal	acts	...	or	utterly	failed	*-2	to	carry	out	their	duties	as	directors	.	''
GE	is	defending	itself	against	government	criminal	charges	of	fraud	and	false	claims	in	connection	with	a	logistics-computer	contract	for	the	Army	.
The	trial	begins	today	in	federal	court	in	Philadelphia	.
The	government	's	assertions	of	the	cover-up	were	made	*-1	in	last	minute	pretrial	motions	.
GE	,	which	*T*-1	vehemently	denies	the	government	's	allegations	,	denounced	Mr.	Greenfield	's	suit	.
``	It	is	a	cheap-shot	suit	--	procedurally	defective	and	thoroughly	fallacious	--	which	*T*-1	was	hurriedly	filed	*-3	by	a	contingency-fee	lawyer	as	a	result	of	newspaper	reports	,	''	said	*T*-2	a	GE	spokeswoman	.
She	added	that	the	company	was	considering	*-1	bringing	sanctions	against	Mr.	Greenfield	for	*-2	making	``	grossly	inaccurate	and	unsupported	allegations	.
The	head	of	the	nation	's	largest	car-dealers	group	is	telling	dealers	*-1	to	``	just	say	no	''	when	auto	makers	pressure	them	to	stockpile	cars	on	their	lots	*T*-2	.
In	an	open	letter	that	*T*-1	will	run	today	in	the	trade	journal	Automotive	News	,	Ron	Tonkin	,	president	of	the	National	Car	Dealers	Association	,	says	0	dealers	should	cut	their	inventories	to	no	more	than	half	the	level	traditionally	considered	*	desirable	.
Mr.	Tonkin	,	who	*T*-1	has	been	feuding	with	the	Big	Three	since	he	took	office	earlier	this	year	,	said	that	with	half	of	the	nation	's	dealers	losing	money	or	breaking	even	,	it	was	time	for	``	emergency	action	.	''
U.S.	car	dealers	had	an	average	of	59	days	'	supply	of	cars	in	their	lots	at	the	end	of	September	,	according	to	Ward	's	Automotive	Reports	.
But	Mr.	Tonkin	said	0	dealers	should	slash	stocks	to	between	15	and	30	days	*-1	to	reduce	the	costs	of	*-2	financing	inventory	.
His	message	is	getting	a	chilly	reception	in	Detroit	,	where	the	Big	Three	auto	makers	are	already	being	forced	*-1	to	close	plants	because	of	soft	sales	and	reduced	dealer	orders	*T*-2	.
Even	before	Mr.	Tonkin	's	broadside	,	some	large	dealers	said	0	they	were	cutting	inventories	.
Ford	Motor	Co.	and	Chrysler	Corp.	representatives	criticized	Mr.	Tonkin	's	plan	as	unworkable	.
It	``	is	going	*-1	to	sound	neat	to	the	dealer	*NOT*	except	when	his	15-day	car	supply	does	n't	include	the	bright	red	one	that	the	lady	wants	*-3	to	buy	*T*-2	*T*-4	and	she	goes	up	the	street	*-5	to	buy	one	*T*-4	,	''	a	Chrysler	spokesman	said	*T*-6	.
Southern	Co.	's	Gulf	Power	Co.	unit	may	plead	guilty	this	week	to	charges	that	it	illegally	steered	company	money	to	politicians	through	outside	vendors	,	according	to	individuals	close	to	an	investigation	of	the	utility	holding	company	.
The	tentative	settlement	between	Gulf	Power	,	a	Pensacola	,	Fla.	,	electric	company	,	and	federal	prosecutors	would	mark	the	end	of	one	part	of	a	wide-ranging	inquiry	of	Southern	Co.	in	the	past	year	.
A	grand	jury	has	been	investigating	whether	officials	at	Southern	Co.	conspired	*-1	to	cover	up	their	accounting	for	spare	parts	*-2	to	evade	federal	income	taxes	.
The	grand	jury	has	also	been	investigating	whether	Gulf	Power	executives	violated	the	federal	Utility	Holding	Company	Act	,	which	*T*-1	prohibits	certain	utilities	from	*-2	making	political	contributions	.
The	individuals	said	0	Gulf	Power	and	federal	prosecutors	are	considering	a	settlement	under	which	the	company	would	plead	guilty	to	two	felony	charges	and	pay	fines	totaling	between	$	500,000	and	$	1.5	million	*U*	*T*-1	.
Under	one	count	,	Gulf	Power	would	plead	guilty	to	*-2	conspiring	*-1	to	violate	the	Utility	Holding	Company	Act	.
Under	the	second	count	,	the	company	would	plead	guilty	to	*-2	conspiring	*-1	to	evade	taxes	.
The	guilty	pleas	would	be	made	*-1	solely	by	Gulf	Power	,	the	individuals	said	0	*T*-2	.
No	employee	or	vendor	would	be	involved	*-1	.
A	spokesman	for	Southern	Co.	would	say	only	that	discussions	*ICH*-1	are	continuing	between	Gulf	Power	and	federal	prosecutors	.
``	We	have	no	further	developments	0	*	to	report	*T*-2	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
Officials	at	Gulf	Power	could	n't	be	reached	*-1	for	comment	.
And	prosecutors	declined	*-1	to	comment	.
While	Southern	Co.	has	been	reluctant	*-2	to	discuss	the	grand	jury	investigations	,	Edward	L.	Addison	,	chief	executive	officer	,	has	said	0	the	company	is	prepared	*-3	to	defend	its	tax	and	acccounting	practices	if	any	charges	are	brought	*-1	against	it	.
Morever	,	Mr.	Addison	has	said	0	Southern	Co.	and	its	units	do	n't	condone	illegal	political	contributions	.
Neither	Mr.	Addison	nor	any	other	Southern	Co.	official	has	been	charged	*-1	with	any	wrongdoing	in	connection	with	the	current	inquiries	.
The	probe	of	Southern	Co.	has	attracted	considerable	attention	this	year	because	of	several	events	that	*T*-1	have	befallen	the	company	,	including	the	death	of	a	Gulf	Power	executive	in	a	plane	crash	and	the	disappearance	of	a	company	vendor	who	*T*-2	was	*-3	to	be	a	key	grand	jury	witness	.
Witnesses	have	said	0	the	grand	jury	has	asked	numerous	questions	about	Jacob	F.	``	Jake	''	Horton	,	the	senior	vice	president	of	Gulf	Power	who	*T*-1	died	in	the	plane	crash	in	April	.
Mr.	Horton	oversaw	Gulf	Power	's	governmental-affairs	efforts	.
On	the	morning	of	the	crash	,	he	had	been	put	*-1	on	notice	that	an	audit	committee	was	recommending	his	dismissal	because	of	invoicing	irregularities	in	a	company	audit	.
Investigators	have	been	trying	*-1	to	determine	whether	the	crash	was	an	accident	,	sabotage	or	suicide	.
Gulf	Power	said	in	May	that	an	internal	audit	had	disclosed	that	at	least	one	vendor	had	used	false	invoices	*-1	to	fund	political	causes	.
But	the	company	said	0	the	political	contributions	had	been	made	*-1	more	than	five	years	ago	.
Exxon	Corp.	is	resigning	from	the	National	Wildlife	Federation	's	corporate	advisory	panel	,	*-1	saying	0	the	conservation	group	has	been	unfairly	critical	of	the	Exxon	Valdez	oil	spill	along	the	Alaskan	coast	.
The	federation	said	Friday	that	it	regrets	the	resignation	,	but	issued	a	stinging	response	that	*T*-1	called	Exxon	a	``	corporate	pariah	''	that	*T*-2	should	keep	an	open	dialogue	with	environmentalists	.
The	federation	,	with	5.8	million	members	nationwide	,	has	been	one	of	the	sharpest	critics	of	Exxon	's	handling	of	the	11	million	gallon	tanker	spill	and	has	accused	the	company	of	*-1	repeatedly	ignoring	requests	*	to	meet	and	discuss	it	.
The	March	24	oil	spill	soiled	hundreds	of	miles	of	shoreline	along	Alaska	's	southern	coast	and	wreaked	havoc	with	wildlife	and	the	fishing	industry	.
Exxon	's	Exxon	USA	unit	was	one	of	the	charter	members	of	the	Corporate	Conservation	Council	,	a	panel	of	executives	formed	*	in	1982	by	the	National	Wildlife	Federation	*-1	to	foster	``	frank	and	open	discussions	''	between	industry	and	the	federation	's	leaders	.
In	a	letter	to	the	federation	,	Raymond	Campion	,	Exxon	's	environmental	coordinator	,	said	:	``	Recent	public	actions	by	you	regarding	the	Valdez	oil	spill	have	failed	*-1	to	demonstrate	any	sense	of	objectivity	or	fairness	.	''
The	federation	was	among	the	plaintiffs	in	a	lawsuit	filed	*	in	August	against	Exxon	seeking	full	payment	of	environmental	recovery	costs	from	the	spill	.
First	Tennessee	National	Corp.	said	0	it	would	take	a	$	4	million	*U*	charge	in	the	fourth	quarter	,	as	a	result	of	plans	*	to	expand	its	systems	operation	.
The	banking	company	said	0	it	reached	an	agreement	in	principle	with	International	Business	Machines	Corp.	on	a	systems	operations	contract	calling	for	IBM	to	operate	First	Tennessee	's	computer	and	telecommunications	functions	.
Further	,	under	the	agreement	,	First	Tennesse	would	continue	*-2	to	develop	the	software	that	*T*-1	creates	customer	products	and	sevices	.
``	Because	personal	computers	will	soon	be	on	the	desks	of	all	of	our	tellers	,	and	customer	service	and	loan	representatives	,	information	will	be	instantly	available	*-1	to	help	customers	with	product	decisions	and	provide	them	with	information	about	their	accounts	,	''	according	to	John	Kelley	,	executive	vice	president	*RNR*-2	and	corporate	services	group	manager	*RNR*-2	at	First	Tennessee	.
However	,	about	120	employees	will	be	affected	*-1	by	the	agreement	.
First	Tennessee	,	*-1	assisted	*-2	by	IBM	,	said	0	it	will	attempt	*-3	to	place	the	employees	within	the	company	,	IBM	or	other	companies	in	Memphis	.
The	process	will	take	as	many	as	six	months	*	to	complete	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	agreement	is	subject	to	the	banking	company	's	board	approval	,	which	*T*-2	is	expected	*-1	next	month	.
The	Treasury	Department	said	0	the	U.S.	trade	deficit	may	worsen	next	year	,	after	two	years	of	significant	improvement	.
In	its	report	to	Congress	on	international	economic	policies	,	the	Treasury	said	that	any	improvement	in	the	broadest	measure	of	trade	,	known	*	as	the	current	account	,	``	is	likely	at	best	*-1	to	be	very	modest	,	''	and	``	the	possibility	of	deterioration	in	the	current	account	next	year	can	not	be	excluded	*-2	.	''
The	statement	was	the	U.S.	government	's	first	acknowledgement	of	what	other	groups	,	such	as	the	International	Monetary	Fund	,	have	been	predicting	*T*-1	for	months	.
Continued	strength	in	the	dollar	was	cited	*-1	as	one	reason	0	the	trade	position	may	deteriorate	*T*-2	.
The	Treasury	's	report	,	which	*T*-2	is	required	*-1	annually	by	a	provision	of	the	1988	trade	act	,	again	took	South	Korea	to	task	for	its	exchange-rate	policies	.
``	We	believe	that	there	have	continued	*-3	to	be	indications	of	exchange-rate	`	manipulation	'	''	during	the	past	six	months	,	it	said	0	*T*-2	,	*-1	citing	the	lack	of	market	forces	in	South	Korea	's	exchange-rate	system	and	the	use	*ICH*-4	of	capital	and	interest-rate	controls	*	to	manipulate	exchange	rates	.
The	Treasury	expressed	pleasure	,	however	,	with	the	government	of	Taiwan	,	which	*T*-2	was	cited	*-1	for	exchange-rate	manipulation	in	last	year	's	report	.
The	Treasury	said	0	Taiwan	has	liberalized	its	exchange	rate	system	in	the	past	year	.
The	fiscal	1989	budget	deficit	figure	came	out	Friday	.
It	was	down	a	little	.
The	next	time	0	you	hear	a	Member	of	Congress	moan	about	the	deficit	*T*-2	,	*	consider	what	Congress	did	*T*-1	Friday	.
The	Senate	,	84-6	,	voted	*-1	to	increase	to	$	124,000	*U*	the	ceiling	on	insured	mortgages	from	the	FHA	,	which	*T*-7	lost	$	4.2	billion	*U*	in	loan	defaults	last	year	.
Then	,	by	voice	vote	,	the	Senate	voted	a	pork-barrel	bill	,	approved	*	Thursday	by	the	House	,	for	domestic	military	construction	.
*	Compare	the	Bush	request	to	what	the	Senators	gave	themselves	*T*-1	:
For	construction	in	West	Virginia	,	Mr.	Bush	requested	$	4.5	million	*U*	;	Congress	gave	Senator	Byrd	's	state	$	21.5	million	*U*	.
Senator	Byrd	is	chairman	of	the	Appropriations	Committee	.
For	Iowa	,	a	$	1.8	million	*U*	request	became	$	12	million	*U*	for	Senator	Grassley	,	ranking	minority	member	of	a	military	construction	subcommittee	.
Rep.	Jamie	Whitten	of	Mississippi	and	chairman	of	House	Appropriations	turned	a	$	20	million	*U*	Bush	request	for	his	state	into	a	$	49.7	million	*U*	bequest	.
Senator	Sasser	of	Tennessee	is	chairman	of	the	Appropriations	subcommittee	on	military	construction	;	Mr.	Bush	's	$	87	million	*U*	request	for	Tennessee	increased	to	$	109	million	*U*	.
In	a	remark	0	someone	should	remember	*T*-1	this	time	next	year	,	Senator	Sasser	said	,	``	I	think	0	we	've	seen	the	peak	of	military	construction	spending	for	many	years	0	*T*-2	to	come	.	''
*	Tell	us	about	spending	restraint	.

Costa	Rica	reached	an	agreement	*ICH*-1	with	its	creditor	banks	that	*T*-2	is	expected	*-3	to	cut	that	government	's	$	1.8	billion	*U*	in	bank	debt	by	as	much	as	60	%	.
The	agreement	was	announced	*-1	by	Costa	Rican	President	Oscar	Arias	Friday	,	as	President	Bush	and	other	leaders	from	the	Western	Hemisphere	gathered	in	the	Central	American	nation	for	a	celebration	of	democracy	.
Costa	Rica	had	been	negotiating	with	the	U.S.	and	other	banks	for	three	years	,	but	the	debt	plan	was	rushed	*-1	to	completion	in	order	*	to	be	announced	*-2	at	the	meeting	.
The	government	had	fallen	$	300	million	*U*	behind	in	interest	payments	.
Treasury	Secretary	Nicholas	Brady	called	the	agreement	``	an	important	step	forward	in	the	strengthened	debt	strategy	,	''	*-1	noting	that	it	will	``	when	*-3	implemented	*-2	,	provide	significant	reduction	in	the	level	of	debt	and	debt	service	owed	*	by	Costa	Rica	.	''
Under	the	plan	,	Costa	Rica	will	buy	back	roughly	60	%	of	its	bank	debt	outstanding	at	a	deeply	discounted	price	,	according	to	officials	involved	*	in	the	agreement	.
The	remainder	of	the	debt	will	be	exchanged	*-1	for	new	Costa	Rican	bonds	with	a	6	1\/4	%	interest	rate	.
The	International	Monetary	Fund	and	the	World	Bank	are	expected	*-2	to	provide	approximately	$	180	million	*U*	*-3	to	help	*-4	support	the	deal	,	and	additional	funds	*ICH*-5	are	expected	*-1	from	Japan	.
Treasury	officials	say	0	the	Costa	Rican	agreement	demonstrates	that	the	Brady	debt	plan	can	benefit	small	debtor	countries	as	well	as	big	debtors	,	such	as	Mexico	.
The	Treasury	said	0	it	plans	*-1	to	sell	$	2	billion	*U*	of	51-day	cash-management	bills	today	,	*-2	raising	all	new	cash	.
The	bills	will	be	dated	*-1	Oct.	31	and	will	mature	Dec.	21	,
No	non-competitive	tenders	will	be	accepted	*-1	.
Tenders	,	available	in	minimum	denominations	of	$	1	million	*U*	,	must	be	received	*-1	by	noon	EST	today	at	Federal	Reserve	Banks	or	branches	.
The	Treasury	also	announced	details	of	this	week	's	unusual	bill	auction	,	which	*T*-1	has	been	changed	*-2	*-3	to	accommodate	the	expiration	of	the	federal	debt	ceiling	at	midnight	tomorrow	.
The	13-week	and	27-week	bills	will	be	issued	*-1	tomorrow	rather	than	Thursday	,	Nov.	2	,	as	*	originally	planned	*-2	.
The	three-month	bills	will	still	mature	Feb.	1	,	1990	,	and	the	six-month	bills	on	May	3	,	1990	.
The	Treasury	also	said	0	noncompetitive	tenders	will	be	considered	*-1	timely	if	*-1	postmarked	*-2	no	later	than	Sunday	,	Oct.	29	,	and	received	no	later	than	tomorrow	.
The	Treasury	said	0	it	wo	n't	be	able	*-1	to	honor	reinvestment	requests	from	holders	of	bills	maturing	Nov.	2	held	*	in	the	Treasury	's	book-entry	system	.
The	department	will	make	payment	for	bills	maturing	on	Nov.	2	to	all	investors	who	*T*-1	have	requested	reinvestment	of	their	bills	on	that	date	,	as	well	as	to	all	account	holders	who	*T*-2	have	previously	requested	payment	.
American	Pioneer	Inc.	said	0	it	agreed	in	principle	*-1	to	sell	its	American	Pioneer	Life	Insurance	Co.	subsidiary	to	Harcourt	Brace	Jovanovich	Inc.	's	HBJ	Insurance	Cos.	for	$	27	million	*U*	.
American	Pioneer	,	parent	of	American	Pioneer	Savings	Bank	,	said	0	the	sale	will	add	capital	and	reduce	the	level	of	investments	in	subsidiaries	for	the	thrift	holding	company	.
Recently	,	the	boards	of	both	the	parent	company	and	the	thrift	also	voted	*-1	to	suspend	dividends	on	preferred	shares	of	both	companies	and	convert	all	preferred	into	common	shares	.
The	company	said	0	the	move	was	necessary	*-1	to	meet	capital	requirements	.
The	transaction	is	subject	to	execution	of	a	definitive	purchase	agreement	and	approval	by	various	regulatory	agencies	,	including	the	insurance	departments	of	the	states	of	Florida	and	Indiana	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-1	.
In	the	second	quarter	,	American	Pioneer	reported	a	loss	of	$	7.3	million	*U*	,	compared	with	net	income	of	$	1.1	million	*U*	a	year	earlier	.
The	banking	operation	had	a	loss	of	$	8.7	million	*U*	in	the	second	quarter	,	largely	because	of	problem	real-estate	loans	,	while	the	insurance	operations	earned	$	884,000	*U*	.
October	employment	data	--	also	could	turn	out	*-1	to	be	the	most	confusing	.
On	the	surface	,	the	overall	unemployment	rate	is	expected	*-1	to	be	little	changed	*-2	from	September	's	5.3	%	.
But	the	actual	head	count	of	non-farm	employment	payroll	jobs	is	likely	*-3	to	be	muddied	*-1	by	the	impact	of	Hurricane	Hugo	,	strikes	,	and	less-than-perfect	seasonal	adjustments	,	economists	said	0	*T*-2	.
The	consensus	view	calls	for	an	overall	job	gain	of	155,000	compared	with	September	's	209,000	increase	.
But	the	important	factory-jobs	segment	,	which	*T*-2	last	month	plunged	by	103,000	positions	and	raised	recession	fears	,	is	most	likely	*-3	to	be	skewed	*-1	by	the	month	's	unusual	events	.
Several	other	reports	*ICH*-1	come	before	Friday	's	jobs	data	,	including	:	the	September	leading	indicators	index	,	new-home	sales	and	October	agricultural	prices	reports	due	out	tomorrow	;	the	October	purchasing	managers	'	index	and	September	construction	spending	and	manufacturers	'	orders	on	Wednesday	;	and	October	chain-store	sales	on	Thursday	.
Friday	brings	the	final	count	on	October	auto	sales	.
``	The	employment	report	is	going	*-2	to	be	difficult	0	*	to	interpret	*T*-3	,	''	said	*T*-1	Michael	Englund	,	economist	with	MMS	International	,	a	unit	of	McGraw-Hill	Inc.	,	New	York	.
Mr.	Englund	added	that	next	month	's	data	is	n't	likely	*-2	to	be	much	better	,	because	it	will	be	distorted	*-1	by	San	Francisco	's	earthquake	.
What	*T*-1	's	more	,	he	believes	0	seasonal	swings	in	the	auto	industry	this	year	are	n't	occurring	at	the	same	time	as	in	the	past	,	because	of	production	and	pricing	differences	that	*T*-2	are	curbing	the	accuracy	of	seasonal	adjustments	built	*	into	the	employment	data	.
Wednesday	's	report	from	the	purchasing	agents	will	be	watched	*-1	*	to	see	if	the	index	maintains	a	level	below	50	%	,	as	it	has	*?*	for	the	past	couple	of	months	.
A	reading	of	less	than	50	%	indicates	an	economy	that	*T*-1	is	generally	contracting	while	a	reading	above	50	%	indicates	an	economy	that	*T*-2	's	expanding	.
Samuel	D.	Kahan	,	chief	financial	economist	at	Kleinwort	Benson	Government	Securities	Inc.	,	Chicago	,	said	that	the	purchasers	'	report	is	valuable	because	it	often	presents	the	first	inkling	of	economic	data	for	the	month	.
But	he	added	:	``	Some	people	use	the	purchasers	'	index	as	a	leading	indicator	,	some	use	it	as	a	coincident	indicator	.
But	the	thing	0	it	's	supposed	*-2	to	measure	*T*-1	--	manufacturing	strength	--	it	missed	*-3	altogether	last	month	.	''
David	Wyss	,	chief	financial	economist	at	Data	Resources	Inc.	,	Boston	,	said	that	the	purchasers	'	index	``	does	miss	occasionally	,	''	*-1	adding	:	``	When	it	misses	one	month	*T*-2	it	tends	*-3	to	miss	the	next	month	,	too	.	''
The	consensus	view	on	September	leading	indicators	calls	for	a	gain	of	0.3	%	,	the	same	as	in	August	.
Economists	said	0	greatly	increased	consumer	optimism	,	a	larger	money	supply	and	higher	stock	prices	helped	*-1	lift	the	index	.
All	orders-related	components	,	such	as	consumer-goods	orders	and	building	permits	,	are	thought	*-1	to	have	been	weaker	.
Data	Resources	'	Mr.	Wyss	added	that	he	will	be	keeping	a	closer	eye	than	ususal	on	October	chain-store	sales	.
Usually	,	October	``	is	n't	a	very	interesting	month	-LCB-	for	retail	figures	-RCB-	because	school	clothes	have	been	bought	*-1	and	people	are	waiting	for	December	*-3	to	buy	Christmas	presents	,	''	he	said	0	*T*-2	.
But	Mr.	Wyss	said	0	he	will	watch	the	numbers	*-1	to	get	an	inkling	of	whether	consumers	'	general	buying	habits	may	slack	off	as	much	as	their	auto-buying	apparently	has	*?*	.
He	noted	that	higher	gasoline	prices	will	help	*-1	buoy	the	October	totals	.
Seasonal	factors	are	also	expected	*-2	to	have	taken	their	toll	on	September	new-home	sales	,	which	*T*-1	are	believed	*-3	to	have	fallen	sharply	from	August	's	755,000	units	.
Construction	spending	is	believed	*-1	to	have	slipped	about	0.5	%	from	August	levels	,	although	economists	noted	0	the	rate	probably	will	pick	up	in	the	months	ahead	in	response	to	hurricane	and	earthquake	damage	.
Factory	owners	are	buying	new	machinery	at	a	good	rate	this	fall	,	machine	tool	makers	say	0	*T*-1	,	but	sluggish	sales	of	new	cars	and	trucks	raise	questions	about	fourth-quarter	demand	from	the	important	automotive	industry	.
September	orders	for	machine	tools	rebounded	from	the	summer	doldrums	,	but	remained	7.7	%	below	year-earlier	levels	,	according	to	figures	from	NMTBA	--	the	Association	for	Manufacturing	Technology	.
Domestic	machine	tool	plants	received	$	303	million	*U*	of	orders	last	month	,	up	33	%	from	August	's	$	227.1	million	*U*	,	but	still	below	the	$	328.2	million	*U*	of	September	1988	,	NMTBA	said	0	*T*-1	.
Machine	tools	are	complex	machines	ranging	from	lathes	to	metal-forming	presses	that	*T*-1	are	used	*-2	to	shape	most	metal	parts	.
``	Overall	demand	still	is	very	respectable	,	''	says	*T*-1	Christopher	C.	Cole	,	group	vice	president	at	Cincinnati	Milacron	Inc.	,	the	nation	's	largest	machine	tool	producer	.
``	The	outlook	*ICH*-1	is	positive	for	the	intermediate	to	long	term	.	''
September	orders	for	all	U.S.	producers	,	in	fact	,	were	slightly	above	the	monthly	average	for	1988	,	a	good	year	for	the	industry	.
``	Aerospace	orders	are	very	good	,	''	Mr.	Cole	says	*T*-1	.
``	And	export	business	is	still	good	.
While	some	automotive	programs	have	been	delayed	*-1	,	they	have	n't	been	canceled	*-2	.	''
``	September	was	one	of	the	biggest	order	months	in	our	history	,	''	says	*T*-1	James	R.	Roberts	,	vice	president	,	world-wide	sales	and	marketing	,	for	Giddings	&	Lewis	Inc.	,	Fond	du	Lac	,	Wis	.
At	a	recent	meeting	of	manufacturing	executives	,	``	everybody	0	I	talked	with	*T*-1	was	very	positive	,	''	he	says	0	*T*-2	.
Most	say	0	they	plan	*-1	to	spend	more	*ICH*-2	on	factory	equipment	in	1990	than	in	1989	.
But	sales	of	North	American-made	1990-model	cars	are	running	at	an	annual	rate	of	only	six	million	,	down	from	7.1	million	a	year	earlier	.
And	truck	sales	also	are	off	more	than	20	%	.
Auto	makers	,	who	*T*-1	began	*-2	deferring	some	equipment	purchases	last	spring	,	can	be	expected	*-3	to	remain	cautious	about	spending	if	their	sales	do	n't	pick	up	,	machine	tool	builders	say	0	*T*-4	.
Machine	tool	executives	are	hopeful	,	however	,	that	recent	developments	in	Eastern	Europe	will	expand	markets	for	U.S.-made	machine	tools	in	that	region	.
There	is	demand	for	state-of-the-art	machine	tools	in	the	Soviet	Union	and	in	other	Eastern	European	countries	as	those	nations	strive	*-1	to	improve	the	efficiency	of	their	ailing	factories	as	well	as	the	quality	of	their	goods	.
However	,	there	's	a	continuing	dispute	between	machine	tool	makers	and	the	Defense	Department	over	whether	sophisticated	U.S.	machine	tools	would	increase	the	Soviet	Union	's	military	might	.
``	The	Commerce	Department	says	*	go	,	and	the	Defense	Department	says	*	stop	,	''	complains	*T*-1	one	machine	tool	producer	.
If	that	controversy	continues	,	U.S.	machine	tool	makers	say	0	*T*-2	,	West	German	and	other	foreign	producers	are	likely	*-1	to	grab	most	of	the	sales	in	Eastern	Europe	.
September	orders	for	machining	centers	,	lathes	,	milling	machines	,	grinders	,	boring	mills	and	other	machines	that	*T*-1	shape	metal	by	cutting	totaled	$	192.9	million	*U*	,	down	28	%	from	$	266.5	million	*U*	a	year	earlier	,	but	a	23	%	increase	from	August	's	$	156.3	million	*U*	,	NMTBA	said	0	*T*-2	.
Orders	*ICH*-1	last	month	for	metal-forming	presses	and	other	machinery	0	*	to	form	metal	with	pressure	*T*-2	surged	to	$	110.1	million	*U*	,	a	78	%	rise	from	$	61.7	million	*U*	a	year	earlier	and	a	55	%	gain	from	$	70.9	million	*U*	in	August	.
Today	's	presses	are	large	and	costly	machines	,	and	a	few	orders	can	produce	a	high	total	for	one	month	that	*T*-1	does	n't	necessarily	indicate	a	trend	.
Machine	tool	shipments	last	month	were	$	281.2	million	*U*	,	a	24	%	rise	from	a	year	earlier	and	a	25	%	increase	from	August	.
Shipments	have	run	well	ahead	of	1988	all	year	,	as	machine	tool	builders	produce	against	relatively	good	backlogs	.
U.S.	producers	had	a	$	2.15	billion	*U*	backlog	of	unfilled	orders	at	the	end	of	September	.
That	was	up	2.8	%	from	a	year	earlier	,	even	though	orders	for	the	first	nine	months	of	1989	were	down	19	%	from	the	comparable	1988	period	.
$	2,057,750,000	*U*	.
$	675,400,000	*U*	.
$	1,048,500,000	*U*	.
$	588,350,000	*U*	.
In	Bombay	stock	market	circles	,	the	buzzword	is	``	mega	.	''
At	least	40	companies	are	coming	to	the	capital	market	*-1	to	raise	$	6	billion	*U*	,	an	amount	never	thought	*	possible	in	India	.
``	When	they	talk	mega-issues	*T*-1	,	they	're	truly	talking	mega	,	''	says	*T*-2	S.A.	Dave	,	chairman	of	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Board	of	India	.
``	The	capital	market	is	booming	.	''
But	the	mega-issues	are	raising	megaquestions	about	the	rapidly	evolving	Indian	capital	market	.
One	is	whether	there	is	enough	money	*	to	fund	the	new	issues	without	*-1	depressing	stock	trading	.
Moreover	,	in	the	relatively	unregulated	Indian	stock	markets	,	investors	frequently	do	n't	know	what	they	are	getting	*T*-1	when	they	subscribe	to	an	issue	*T*-2	.
A	prospectus	in	India	does	n't	always	tell	a	potential	investor	much	.
Some	of	the	large	amounts	are	being	raised	*-1	by	small	firms	.
In	addition	,	once	money	is	raised	*-1	,	investors	usually	have	no	way	of	*	knowing	how	it	is	spent	*-2	*T*-3	.
Some	analysts	are	concerned	that	the	mega-issues	,	in	such	an	unregulated	environment	,	could	lead	to	a	mega-crash	.
``	The	rate	of	failures	will	be	much	more	than	the	rate	of	successes	in	the	mega-projects	,	''	says	*T*-1	G.S.	Patel	,	a	former	chairman	of	the	giant	,	government-run	mutual	fund	,	the	Unit	Trust	of	India	.
``	They	're	going	*-1	to	have	mega-problems	.	''
The	Indian	stock	markets	have	been	on	a	five-year	high	,	with	dips	and	corrections	,	since	Prime	Minister	Rajiv	Gandhi	started	*-1	liberalizing	industry	.
But	the	last	stock	market	boom	,	in	1986	,	seems	small	compared	with	the	current	rush	to	market	.
The	$	6	billion	*U*	that	some	40	companies	are	looking	*-1	to	raise	*T*-2	in	the	year	ending	March	31	compares	with	only	$	2.7	billion	*U*	raised	*	on	the	capital	market	in	the	previous	fiscal	year	.
In	fiscal	1984	,	before	Mr.	Gandhi	came	to	power	,	only	$	810	million	*U*	was	raised	*-1	.
This	year	's	biggest	issue	,	$	570	million	*U*	of	convertible	debentures	by	engineering	company	Larsen	&	Toubro	Ltd.	,	is	the	largest	in	Indian	history	.
And	it	is	n't	the	only	giant	issue	:	together	,	the	top	four	issues	will	raise	$	1.3	billion	*U*	.
Convertible	debentures	--	bonds	that	*T*-2	can	later	be	converted	*-1	into	equity	shares	--	are	the	most	popular	instrument	this	year	,	though	many	companies	are	also	selling	nonconvertible	bonds	or	equity	shares	.
These	mega-issues	are	being	propelled	*-1	by	two	factors	,	economic	and	political	.
In	the	past	,	the	socialist	policies	of	the	government	strictly	limited	the	size	of	new	steel	mills	,	petrochemical	plants	,	car	factories	and	other	industrial	concerns	*	to	conserve	resources	and	restrict	the	profits	0	businessmen	could	make	*T*-1	.
As	a	result	,	industry	operated	out	of	small	,	expensive	,	highly	inefficient	industrial	units	.
When	Mr.	Gandhi	came	to	power	*T*-1	,	he	ushered	in	new	rules	for	business	.
He	said	0	industry	should	build	plants	on	the	same	scale	as	those	outside	India	and	benefit	from	economies	of	scale	.
If	the	output	was	too	great	for	the	domestic	market	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	,	companies	should	export	.
India	's	overregulated	businessmen	had	*-2	to	be	persuaded	*-1	,	but	they	have	started	*-3	to	think	big	.
Some	of	the	projects	being	funded	*	by	the	new	issues	are	the	first	fruits	of	Mr.	Gandhi	's	policy	,	and	they	require	more	capital	than	the	smaller	industrial	units	built	*	in	the	past	.
The	industrial	revolution	has	produced	an	explosion	in	the	capital	market	,	which	*T*-1	is	a	far	cheaper	source	of	funds	than	government-controlled	banks	,	where	interest	rates	for	prime	borrowers	are	around	16	%	*T*-2	.
The	second	factor	spurring	mega-issues	is	political	.
Mr.	Gandhi	has	called	general	elections	for	November	,	and	many	businessmen	fear	that	he	and	his	Congress	-LRB-	I	-RRB-	Party	will	lose	.
Some	companies	are	raising	money	in	anticipation	of	a	government	less	predictable	than	Mr.	Gandhi	's	,	and	possibly	more	restrictive	.
The	buoyant	Bombay	rumor	mill	also	says	that	some	of	the	money	raised	*	in	the	current	spate	of	issues	will	be	used	*-1	as	campaign	donations	before	the	elections	.
No	one	admits	to	anything	,	but	India	's	industrialists	have	a	history	of	*	making	under-the-table	campaign	donations	.
So	far	,	the	mega-issues	are	a	hit	with	investors	.
Earlier	this	year	,	Tata	Iron	&	Steel	Co.	's	offer	of	$	355	million	*U*	of	convertible	debentures	was	oversubscribed	*-1	.
Essar	Gujarat	Ltd.	,	a	marine	construction	company	,	had	similar	success	with	a	slightly	smaller	issue	.
Larsen	&	Toubro	started	*-2	accepting	applications	for	its	giant	issue	earlier	this	month	;	bankers	and	analysts	expect	it	to	be	oversubscribed	*-3	.
*-2	Still	to	come	are	*T*-1	big	issues	by	Bindal	Agro	Chem	Ltd.	,	a	petrochemical	and	agrochemical	company	,	and	Usha	Rectifier	Corp	.	-LRB-	India	-RRB-	,	a	semiconductor	maker	.
While	many	investors	are	selling	parts	of	their	portfolios	*-1	to	buy	the	new	issues	,	prices	on	India	's	16	stock	exchanges	are	holding	up	so	far	.
``	I	do	n't	think	0	it	will	lead	to	any	chaos	in	the	secondary	market	,	''	says	*T*-2	Mr.	Patel	,	``	only	a	sagging	tendency	.	''
Says	0	*T*-2	M.J.	Pherwani	,	chairman	of	the	Unit	Trust	of	India	:	The	``	markets	are	headed	*-1	for	growth	unheard	of	and	unseen	before	.	''
But	with	growth	come	growing	pains	,	and	never	has	this	been	clearer	*ICH*-1	on	the	Indian	capital	market	than	now	.
In	the	past	,	the	government	controlled	the	markets	indirectly	,	through	its	tight	grip	on	industry	itself	.
Various	ministries	decided	the	products	0	businessmen	could	produce	*T*-2	and	how	much	*?*	;	and	government-owned	banks	controlled	the	financing	of	projects	and	monitored	whether	companies	came	through	on	promised	plans	.
The	government	has	been	content	with	this	far-reaching	,	subtle	form	of	control	,	exercised	*	on	a	case-by-case	basis	with	no	clear	rules	or	guidelines	.
But	now	,	with	large	amounts	being	raised	*-1	from	investors	,	the	government	's	dawdling	on	regulation	and	disclosure	requirements	has	a	more	dangerous	aspect	.
The	Securities	and	Exchange	Board	of	India	was	set	up	earlier	this	year	,	along	the	lines	of	the	U.S.	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	,	but	New	Delhi	has	n't	pushed	the	legislation	*-1	to	make	it	operational	.
Mr.	Dave	,	its	head	,	acts	cheery	and	patient	,	but	he	makes	no	bones	about	the	need	*	to	get	to	work	.
``	Mega	or	non-mega	,	we	feel	0	the	prospectus	standards	*T*-4	need	*-3	to	be	considerably	improved	*-2	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	Disclosures	are	very	poor	in	India	.	''
He	says	0	the	big	questions	--	``	Do	you	really	need	this	much	money	*-2	to	put	up	these	investments	?	Have	you	told	investors	what	*T*-1	is	happening	in	your	sector	?	What	about	your	track	record	?	--	``	are	n't	asked	*-3	of	companies	coming	to	market	.
Instead	,	he	says	0	*T*-2	,	most	investors	have	*-1	to	rely	on	the	rumor-happy	Indian	press	.
An	example	is	the	biggest	offering	of	them	all	,	Larsen	&	Toubro	's	$	570	million	*U*	bond	issue	.
The	engineering	company	was	acquired	*-1	in	a	takeover	earlier	this	year	by	the	giant	Reliance	textile	group	.
Although	Larsen	&	Toubro	had	n't	raised	money	from	the	public	in	38	years	,	its	new	owners	frequently	raise	funds	on	the	local	market	.
-LRB-	Reliance	floated	a	$	357	million	*U*	petrochemical	company	*ICH*-3	in	1988	that	*T*-2	was	,	at	the	time	,	the	largest	public	issue	in	Indian	history	.	-RRB-
The	media	has	raised	questions	about	Larsen	&	Toubro	's	issue	,	*-1	pointing	out	that	it	exceeds	the	company	's	annual	sales	and	its	market	capitalization	.
Even	stranger	is	*T*-2	the	case	of	Usha	Rectifier	,	a	semiconductor	company	with	1988	sales	of	$	28	million	*U*	that	*T*-1	's	raising	$	270	million	*U*	*-3	to	build	an	iron	plant	.
Once	the	money	is	raised	*-1	,	it	*ICH*-4	is	n't	always	certain	how	it	is	used	*-2	*T*-3	.
Larsen	&	Toubro	,	for	example	,	says	it	's	raising	$	570	million	*U*	0	*	to	use	*T*-1	as	supplier	credit	on	large	engineering	jobs	.
Unlike	other	companies	,	it	has	n't	pin-pointed	specific	projects	for	the	funds	.
And	even	when	specific	projects	are	described	*-1	in	prospectuses	*T*-3	,	the	money	often	is	used	*-2	elsewhere	,	according	to	analysts	.
``	Someone	must	monitor	where	the	funds	are	deployed	*-1	*T*-3	,	''	says	*T*-2	Mr.	Dave	.
Mr.	Patel	agrees	:	``	There	is	no	proper	monitoring	and	screening	of	the	use	of	these	funds	.
They	're	trying	*-1	to	plug	the	various	loopholes	,	but	they	're	totally	unprepared	for	this	.	''
Because	of	the	large	amounts	of	money	being	raised	*	,	the	loose	disclosure	requirements	and	the	casual	monitoring	of	how	the	money	is	used	*-1	*T*-4	,	some	analysts	fear	that	there	could	be	a	few	mega-crashes	,	which	*T*-2	could	hurt	market	confidence	far	more	than	the	small	bankruptcies	that	*T*-3	followed	the	boom	of	1986	.
The	government	insists	that	such	a	possibility	is	low	.
It	says	that	despite	loose	regulation	of	the	market	itself	,	its	longstanding	regulation	of	industry	will	prevent	such	crashes	.

Lion	Nathan	Ltd.	,	a	New	Zealand	brewing	and	retail	concern	,	said	Friday	that	Bond	Corp	.	Holdings	Ltd.	is	``	committed	''	*-1	to	a	transaction	whereby	Lion	Nathan	would	acquire	50	%	of	Bond	's	Australian	brewing	assets	*T*-2	.
Lion	Nathan	issued	a	statement	saying	0	it	is	applying	to	Australia	's	National	Companies	&	Securities	Commission	,	the	nation	's	corporate	watchdog	agency	,	for	a	modification	to	takeover	regulations	``	similar	to	that	obtained	*	by	''	S.A.	Brewing	Holdings	Ltd	.
SA	Brewing	,	an	Australian	brewer	,	last	Thursday	was	given	*-1	approval	0	*	to	acquire	an	option	for	up	to	20	%	of	Bell	Resources	Ltd.	,	a	unit	of	Bond	Corp	*T*-2	.
Bell	Resources	is	acquiring	Bond	's	brewing	businesses	for	2.5	billion	Australian	dollars	-LRB-	US$	1.9	billion	*U*	-RRB-	.
S.A.	brewing	would	make	a	takeover	offer	for	all	of	Bell	Resources	if	it	exercises	the	option	,	according	to	the	commission	.
Bond	Corp.	,	a	brewing	,	property	,	media	and	resources	company	,	is	selling	many	of	its	assets	*-1	to	reduce	its	debts	.
``	Lion	Nathan	has	a	concluded	contract	with	Bond	and	Bell	Resources	,	''	said	*T*-1	Douglas	Myers	,	chief	executive	of	Lion	Nathan	.
Finnair	,	Finland	's	state-owned	airline	,	joined	the	wave	of	global	airline	alliances	and	signed	a	wide-ranging	cooperation	agreement	with	archrival	Scandinavian	Airlines	System	.
Under	the	accord	,	Finnair	agreed	*-1	to	coordinate	flights	,	marketing	and	other	functions	with	SAS	,	the	50%-state-owned	airline	of	Denmark	,	Norway	and	Sweden	.
The	pact	also	calls	for	coordination	between	Finnair	and	Switzerland	's	national	carrier	,	Swissair	,	with	which	SAS	entered	a	similar	alliance	last	month	*T*-1	.
Finnair	and	SAS	said	0	they	plan	*-1	to	swap	stakes	in	each	other	.
Neither	disclosed	details	pending	board	meetings	next	month	.
Officials	hinted	,	however	,	that	SAS	would	take	a	stake	of	at	least	6	%	in	Finnair	,	valued	*	at	about	$	40	million	*U*	at	current	market	prices	.
Finnair	would	receive	SAS	shares	valued	*	at	the	same	amount	,	officials	said	0	*T*-1	.
General	Motors	Corp.	and	Ford	Motor	Co.	are	now	going	head	to	head	in	the	markets	for	shares	of	Jaguar	PLC	,	as	GM	got	early	clearance	*ICH*-1	from	the	Federal	Trade	Commission	*	to	boost	its	stake	in	the	British	luxury	car	maker	.
GM	confirmed	Friday	that	it	received	permission	*ICH*-1	late	Thursday	from	U.S.	antitrust	regulators	*	to	increase	its	Jaguar	holdings	past	the	$	15	million	*U*	level	.
Ford	got	a	similar	go-ahead	earlier	in	October	,	and	on	Friday	,	Jaguar	announced	that	the	No.	2	U.S.	auto	maker	had	raised	its	stake	to	13.2	%	,	or	24.2	million	shares	,	from	12.4	%	earlier	in	the	week	.
A	spokesman	for	GM	,	the	No.	1	auto	maker	,	declined	*-2	to	say	how	many	Jaguar	shares	that	company	owns	*T*-1	.
In	late	trading	Friday	,	Jaguar	shares	bucked	the	downward	tide	in	London	's	stock	market	and	rose	five	pence	to	725	pence	-LRB-	$	11.44	*U*	-RRB-	.
Trading	volume	was	a	moderately	heavy	3.1	million	shares	.
In	the	U.S.	,	Jaguar	's	American	depositary	receipts	were	among	the	most	active	issues	Friday	in	national	over-the-counter	trading	where	they	closed	at	$	11.625	*U*	each	,	up	62.5	cents	*T*-1	.
Analysts	expect	that	the	two	U.S.	auto	giants	will	move	quickly	*-1	to	buy	up	15	%	stakes	in	Jaguar	,	*-1	setting	up	a	potential	bidding	war	for	the	prestigious	Jaguar	brand	.
British	government	restrictions	prevent	any	single	shareholder	from	*-1	going	beyond	15	%	before	the	end	of	1990	without	government	permission	.
The	British	government	,	which	*T*-1	owned	Jaguar	until	1984	,	still	holds	a	controlling	``	golden	share	''	in	the	company	.
With	the	golden	share	as	protection	,	Jaguar	officials	have	rebuffed	Ford	's	overtures	,	and	moved	instead	*-1	to	forge	an	alliance	with	GM	.
Jaguar	officials	have	indicated	0	they	are	close	to	*-3	wrapping	up	a	friendly	alliance	with	GM	that	*T*-2	would	preserve	Jaguar	's	independence	,	but	no	deal	has	been	announced	*-1	.
Ford	,	on	the	other	hand	,	has	said	0	it	's	willing	*-1	to	bid	for	all	of	Jaguar	,	despite	the	objections	of	Jaguar	chairman	Sir	John	Egan	.
Analysts	continued	*-1	to	speculate	late	last	week	that	Ford	may	try	*-2	to	force	the	issue	by	*-3	calling	for	a	special	shareholder	's	meeting	and	urging	that	the	government	and	Jaguar	holders	remove	the	barriers	to	a	full	bidding	contest	before	December	1990	.
But	a	Ford	spokeswoman	in	Dearborn	said	Friday	0	the	company	has	n't	requested	such	a	meeting	yet	.
Individuals	close	to	the	situation	believe	0	Ford	officials	will	seek	a	meeting	*ICH*-1	*ICH*-2	this	week	with	Sir	John	0	*	to	outline	their	proposal	for	a	full	bid	*T*-3	.
Any	discussions	with	Ford	could	postpone	the	Jaguar-GM	deal	,	headed	*	for	completion	within	the	next	two	weeks	.
The	GM	agreement	is	expected	*-1	to	retain	Jaguar	's	independence	by	*-2	involving	an	eventual	30	%	stake	for	the	U.S.	auto	giant	as	well	as	joint	manufacturing	and	marketing	ventures	.
Jaguar	and	GM	hope	*-2	to	win	Jaguar	shareholders	approval	for	the	accord	partly	by	*-3	structuring	it	in	a	way	that	*T*-1	would	n't	preclude	a	full	Ford	bid	once	the	golden	share	expires	.
``	There	's	either	a	minority	-LCB-	stake	-RCB-	package	capable	of	*	getting	Jaguar	shareholder	approval	or	there	is	n't	*?*	,	''	said	*T*-1	one	knowledgeable	individual	.	``
If	there	is	n't	*?*	,	-LCB-	the	deal	-RCB-	wo	n't	be	put	*-1	forward	''	to	shareholders	.
Union	sentiment	also	could	influence	shareholder	reaction	to	a	Jaguar-GM	accord	.
GM	's	U.K.	unit	holds	crucial	talks	*ICH*-2	*ICH*-1	today	with	union	officials	about	its	consideration	of	an	Ellesmere	Port	site	for	its	first	major	engine	plant	in	Britain	.
One	auto-industry	union	leader	said	,	``	If	they	try	*-1	to	build	it	somewhere	else	-LCB-	in	Europe	-RCB-	besides	the	U.K.	,	they	are	going	*-2	to	be	in	big	trouble	''	with	unionists	over	any	Jaguar	deal	.
These	are	the	last	words	0	Abbie	Hoffman	ever	uttered	*T*-1	,	more	or	less	,	before	he	killed	himself	.
And	You	Are	There	,	sort	of	:
ABBIE	:	``	I	'm	OK	,	Jack	.
I	'm	OK	.	''
-LRB-	*	listening	-RRB-	``	Yeah	.
I	'm	out	of	bed	.
I	got	my	feet	on	the	floor	.
Yeah	.
Two	feet	.
I	'll	see	you	Wednesday	?	...	Thursday	.	''
He	listens	impassively	.
ABBIE	-LRB-	*	cont'd.	*-1	-RRB-	:	``	I	'll	always	be	with	you	,	Jack	.
*	Do	n't	worry	.	''
Abbie	lies	back	and	leaves	the	frame	empty	.
Of	course	that	was	n't	the	actual	conversation	0	the	late	anti-war	activist	,	protest	leader	and	founder	of	the	Yippies	ever	had	*T*-1	with	his	brother	.
It	's	a	script	pieced	*	together	from	interviews	by	CBS	News	for	a	re-enactment	,	a	dramatic	rendering	by	an	actor	of	Mr.	Hoffman	's	ultimately	unsuccessful	struggle	with	depression	.
The	segment	is	*-2	soon	to	be	broadcast	*-3	on	the	CBS	News	series	``	Saturday	Night	With	Connie	Chung	,	''	thus	*	further	blurring	the	distinction	between	fiction	and	reality	in	TV	news	.
It	is	the	New	Journalism	come	to	television	.
Ms.	Chung	's	program	is	just	one	of	several	network	shows	-LRB-	and	many	more	in	syndication	-RRB-	that	*T*-1	rely	on	the	controversial	technique	of	*	reconstructing	events	,	using	actors	who	*T*-2	are	supposed	*-3	to	resemble	real	people	,	living	and	dead	.
Ms.	Chung	's	,	however	,	is	said	*-1	to	be	the	only	network	news	program	in	history	0	*T*-2	to	employ	casting	directors	.
Abbie	Hoffman	in	this	case	is	*-3	to	be	played	*-1	by	Hollywood	actor	Paul	Lieber	,	who	*T*-2	is	n't	new	to	the	character	.
He	was	Mr.	Hoffman	in	a	1979	Los	Angeles	production	of	a	play	called	*	``	The	Chicago	Conspiracy	Trial	.	''
Television	news	,	of	course	,	has	always	been	part	show-biz	.
Broadcasters	have	a	healthy	appreciation	of	the	role	0	entertainment	values	play	*T*-1	in	*	captivating	an	audience	.
But	,	as	CBS	Broadcast	Group	president	Howard	Stringer	puts	it	,	the	network	now	needs	*-1	to	``	broaden	the	horizons	of	nonfiction	television	,	and	that	includes	some	experimentation	.	''
Since	its	premiere	Sept.	16	,	the	show	on	which	Ms.	Chung	appears	*T*-1	has	used	an	actor	*-2	to	portray	the	Rev.	Vernon	Johns	,	a	civil-rights	leader	,	and	one	*-4	to	play	a	teenage	drug	dealer	.
It	has	depicted	the	bombing	of	Pan	Am	flight	103	over	the	Scottish	town	of	Lockerbie	.
On	Oct.	21	,	it	did	a	rendition	of	the	kidnapping	and	imprisonment	of	Associated	Press	correspondent	Terry	Anderson	,	who	*T*-2	was	abducted	*-3	in	March	1985	and	is	believed	*-3	to	be	held	*-1	in	Lebanon	.
The	production	had	actors	playing	Mr.	Anderson	and	former	hostages	David	Jacobsen	,	the	Rev.	Benjamin	Weir	and	Father	Lawrence	Jenco	.
ABC	News	has	similarly	branched	out	into	entertainment	gimmickry	.
``	Prime	Time	Live	,	''	a	new	show	this	season	featuring	Sam	Donaldson	and	Diane	Sawyer	,	has	a	studio	audience	that	*T*-1	applauds	and	that	one	night	-LRB-	to	the	embarrassment	of	the	network	-RRB-	*T*-2	waved	at	the	camera	like	the	crowd	on	``	*	Let	's	Make	a	Deal	.	''
-LRB-	ABC	stops	short	of	*-2	using	an	``	applause	''	sign	and	a	comic	*-1	to	warm	up	the	audience	.
The	stars	do	that	themselves	.	-RRB-
NBC	News	has	produced	three	episodes	of	an	occasional	series	produced	*	by	Sid	Feders	called	*	``	Yesterday	,	Today	and	Tomorrow	,	''	starring	Maria	Shriver	,	Chuck	Scarborough	and	Mary	Alice	Williams	,	that	*T*-1	also	gives	work	to	actors	.
*	Call	it	a	fad	.
Or	*	call	it	the	wave	of	the	future	.
NBC	's	re-creations	are	produced	*-1	by	Cosgrove-Meurer	Productions	,	which	*T*-2	also	makes	the	successful	prime-time	NBC	Entertainment	series	``	Unsolved	Mysteries	.	''
The	marriage	of	news	and	theater	,	if	not	exactly	inevitable	,	has	been	consummated	*-1	nonetheless	.
News	programs	,	particularly	if	they	score	well	in	the	ratings	,	appeal	to	the	networks	'	cost-conscious	corporate	parents	because	they	are	so	much	less	expensive	*	to	produce	*?*	than	an	entertainment	show	is	*?*	--	somewhere	between	$	400,000	and	$	500,000	*U*	for	a	one-hour	program	.
Entertainment	shows	tend	*-1	to	cost	twice	that	.
Re-enactments	have	been	used	*-1	successfully	for	several	seasons	on	such	syndicated	``	tabloid	TV	''	shows	as	``	A	Current	Affair	,	''	which	*T*-3	is	produced	*-2	by	the	Fox	Broadcasting	Co.	unit	of	Rupert	Murdoch	's	News	Corp	.
That	show	,	whose	host	*T*-1	is	Ms.	Chung	's	husband	,	Maury	Povich	,	has	a	particular	penchant	for	grisly	murders	and	stories	having	*	to	do	with	sex	--	the	Robert	Chambers	murder	case	,	the	Rob	Lowe	tapes	,	what	have	*T*-2	you	.
Gerald	Stone	,	the	executive	producer	of	``	A	Current	Affair	,	''	says	,	``	We	have	opened	eyes	to	*	being	a	little	less	conservative	and	more	imaginative	in	how	*	to	present	the	news	*T*-1	.	''
Nowhere	have	eyes	been	opened	*-1	wider	than	at	CBS	News	.
At	555	W.	57th	St.	in	Manhattan	,	one	floor	below	the	offices	of	``	60	Minutes	,	''	the	most	successful	prime-time	news	program	ever	,	actors	wait	in	the	reception	area	*-1	to	audition	for	``	Saturday	Night	With	Connie	Chung	.	''
CBS	News	sends	scripts	to	agents	,	who	*T*-1	pass	them	along	to	clients	.
The	network	deals	a	lot	with	unknowns	,	including	Scott	Wentworth	,	who	*T*-1	portrayed	Mr.	Anderson	,	and	Bill	Alton	as	Father	Jenco	,	but	the	network	has	some	big	names	0	*	to	contend	with	*T*-2	,	too	.
James	Earl	Jones	is	cast	*-1	*-2	to	play	the	Rev.	Mr.	Johns	.
Ned	Beatty	may	portray	former	California	Gov.	Pat	Brown	in	a	forthcoming	epsiode	on	Caryl	Chessman	,	the	last	man	0	*T*-2	to	be	executed	*-1	in	California	,	in	1960	.
``	Saturday	Night	''	has	cast	actors	*-2	to	appear	in	future	stories	ranging	from	the	abortion	rights	of	teen-agers	to	a	Nov.	4	segment	on	a	man	named	*	Willie	Bosket	,	who	*T*-1	calls	himself	a	``	monster	''	and	is	reputed	*-3	to	be	the	toughest	prisoner	in	New	York	.
CBS	News	,	which	as	recently	as	two	years	ago	*T*-1	fired	hundreds	of	its	employees	in	budget	cutbacks	,	now	hires	featured	actors	beginning	at	$	2,700	*U*	a	week	.
That	is	n't	much	compared	with	what	Bill	Cosby	makes	*T*-4	,	or	even	Connie	Chung	for	that	matter	-LRB-	who	*T*-2	is	paid	*-1	$	1.6	million	*U*	a	year	and	who	*T*-3	recently	did	a	guest	shot	of	her	own	on	the	sitcom	``	Murphy	Brown	''	-RRB-	.
But	the	money	is	n't	peanuts	either	,	particularly	for	a	news	program	.
CBS	News	is	also	re-enacting	the	1979	Three	Mile	Island	nuclear	accident	in	Middletown	,	Pa.	,	with	something	less	than	a	cast	of	thousands	.
It	is	combing	the	town	of	10,000	for	about	200	extras	.
On	Oct.	20	,	the	town	's	mayor	,	Robert	Reid	,	made	an	announcement	on	behalf	of	CBS	during	half-time	at	the	Middletown	High	School	football	game	*-1	asking	for	volunteers	.
``	There	was	a	roll	of	laughter	through	the	stands	,	''	says	*T*-1	Joe	Sukle	,	the	editor	of	the	weekly	Press	and	Journal	in	Middletown	.
``	They	're	filming	right	now	at	the	bank	down	the	street	,	and	they	want	shots	of	people	getting	out	of	cars	and	kids	on	skateboards	.
They	are	approaching	everyone	on	the	street	and	asking	if	they	want	*-1	to	be	in	a	docudrama	.	''
Mr.	Sukle	says	0	he	would	n't	dream	of	*-1	participating	himself	:
``	No	way	.
I	think	0	re-enactments	stink	.	''
Though	a	re-enactment	may	have	the	flavor	,	Hollywood	on	the	Hudson	it	is	n't	*-1	.
Some	producers	seem	tentative	about	the	technique	,	squeamish	even	.
So	the	results	,	while	not	news	,	are	n't	exactly	theater	either	,	at	least	not	good	theater	.
And	some	people	do	think	that	*	acting	out	scripts	is	n't	worthy	of	CBS	News	,	which	*T*-1	once	lent	prestige	to	the	network	and	set	standards	for	the	industry	.
In	his	review	of	``	Saturday	Night	With	Connie	Chung	,	''	Tom	Shales	,	the	TV	critic	of	the	Washington	Post	and	generally	an	admirer	of	CBS	,	wrote	that	while	the	show	is	``	impressive	,	...	one	has	*-1	to	wonder	if	this	is	the	proper	direction	0	for	a	network	news	division	to	take	*T*-2	.	''
*	Re-creating	events	has	,	in	general	,	upset	news	traditionalists	,	including	former	CBS	News	President	Richard	S.	Salant	and	former	NBC	News	President	Reuven	Frank	,	former	CBS	News	anchorman	Walter	Cronkite	and	the	new	dean	of	the	Columbia	University	Graduate	School	of	Journalism	,	Joan	Konner	.
Says	*ICH*-1	she	:	``	Once	you	add	dramatizations	,	it	's	no	longer	news	,	it	's	drama	,	and	that	has	no	place	on	a	network	news	broadcast	...	.
They	should	never	be	on	.
Never	.	''
Criticism	of	the	Abbie	Hoffman	segment	is	particularly	scathing	among	people	who	*T*-1	knew	and	loved	the	man	.
That	includes	his	companion	of	15	years	,	Johanna	Lawrenson	,	as	well	as	his	former	wife	,	Anita	.
Both	women	say	0	they	also	find	it	*EXP*-1	distasteful	that	CBS	News	is	apparently	concentrating	on	Mr.	Hoffman	's	problems	as	a	manic-depressive	.
``	This	is	dangerous	and	misrepresents	Abbie	's	life	,	''	says	*T*-2	Ms.	Lawrenson	,	who	*T*-1	has	had	an	advance	look	at	the	36-page	script	.
``	It	's	a	sensational	piece	about	someone	who	*T*-1	is	not	here	*-2	to	defend	himself	.	''
Mrs.	Hoffman	says	that	dramatization	``	makes	the	truth	flexible	.
It	takes	one	person	's	account	and	gives	it	authenticity	.	''
CBS	News	interviewed	Jack	Hoffman	and	his	sister	,	Phyllis	,	as	well	as	Mr.	Hoffman	's	landlord	in	Solebury	Township	,	Pa	.
Also	Jonathan	Silvers	,	who	*T*-1	collaborated	with	Mr.	Hoffman	on	two	books	.
Mr.	Silvers	says	,	``	I	wanted	*-2	to	be	interviewed	*-1	*-2	to	get	Abbie	's	story	out	,	and	maybe	*	talking	about	the	illness	will	do	some	good	.	''
The	executive	producer	of	``	Saturday	Night	With	Connie	Chung	,	''	Andrew	Lack	,	declines	*-1	to	discuss	re-creactions	as	a	practice	or	his	show	,	in	particular	.
``	I	do	n't	talk	about	my	work	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
The	president	of	CBS	News	,	David	W.	Burke	,	did	n't	return	numerous	telephone	calls	.
One	person	close	to	the	process	says	0	it	*EXP*-1	would	not	be	in	the	best	interest	of	CBS	News	*	to	comment	on	a	``	work	in	progress	,	''	such	as	the	Hoffman	re-creation	,	but	says	0	CBS	News	is	``	aware	''	of	the	concerns	of	Ms.	Lawrenson	and	Mr.	Hoffman	's	former	wife	.
Neither	woman	was	invited	*-1	by	CBS	News	*-3	to	participate	in	a	round-table	discussion	about	Mr.	Hoffman	that	*T*-2	is	*-4	to	follow	the	re-enactment	.
Mr.	Lieber	,	the	actor	who	*T*-2	plays	Mr.	Hoffman	,	says	0	he	was	concerned	*ICH*-4	at	first	that	the	script	would	``	misrepresent	an	astute	political	mind	,	one	that	I	admired	*T*-3	,	''	but	that	his	concerns	were	allayed	*-1	.
The	producers	,	he	says	0	*T*-3	,	did	a	good	job	of	*	depicting	someone	``	who	*T*-1	had	done	so	much	,	but	who	*T*-2	was	also	a	manic-depressive	.
Dentsu	Inc.	,	the	world	's	largest	advertising	agency	on	the	strength	of	its	dominance	in	the	Japanese	market	,	is	setting	its	sights	on	overseas	expansion	.
Last	year	,	Dentsu	started	HDM	,	a	joint	network	with	U.S.	ad	agency	Young	&	Rubicam	and	Eurocom	of	France	.
A	few	months	ago	,	Dentsu	acquired	69	%	of	Australian	agency	Fortune	Communication	Holdings	Ltd.	for	5.9	million	Australian	dollars	-LRB-	US$	4.6	million	*U*	-RRB-	.
Dentsu	has	U.S.	subsidiaries	,	but	they	keep	low	profiles	.
Now	,	the	giant	marketing	company	,	which	*T*-1	holds	25	%	of	Japan	's	4.4	trillion	yen	-LRB-	$	30.96	billion	*U*	-RRB-	advertising	industry	,	is	considering	the	acquisition	of	an	advertising	network	in	the	U.S.	or	Europe	.
What	*T*-1	is	driving	Dentsu	's	international	expansion	largely	is	the	need	*	to	keep	up	with	its	Japanese	clients	as	they	grow	in	the	U.S.	and	Europe	.
``	If	we	do	n't	do	something	...	we	wo	n't	be	able	*-2	to	catch	up	with	demand	,	''	says	*T*-1	a	Dentsu	spokesman	.
``	Our	president	said	0	acquisition	is	an	effective	method	.	''
Last	year	,	Dentsu	's	foreign	business	accounted	for	less	than	10	%	of	total	billings	,	but	the	company	is	aiming	at	20	%	in	the	near	future	.
So	far	,	it	appears	cautious	about	*-1	taking	the	big	step	.
For	example	,	the	spokesman	says	0	Dentsu	has	been	approached	*-1	by	banks	and	securities	companies	a	number	of	times	*-2	to	invest	in	the	troubled	British	marketing	group	Saatchi	&	Saatchi	PLC	.
But	he	said	0	Dentsu	has	n't	looked	seriously	at	Saatchi	.
Though	Dentsu	says	0	it	has	no	concrete	acquisition	plans	or	deadlines	,	it	is	laying	the	groundwork	for	international	growth	.
It	is	setting	up	a	special	team	in	charge	of	international	markets	and	*	training	workers	to	do	business	abroad	.
For	the	year	ended	March	31	,	Dentsu	sales	rose	19	%	to	$	8.9	billion	*U*	from	$	7.5	billion	*U*	,	and	net	income	jumped	59	%	to	$	102	million	*U*	from	$	64	million	*U*	.
Dentsu	's	billings	last	year	were	larger	than	those	of	Young	&	Rubicam	,	the	world	's	second-largest	ad	agency	,	according	to	a	survey	by	the	publication	Advertising	Age	.
But	success	overseas	in	unfamiliar	markets	could	be	trickier	than	for	other	industries	such	as	manufacturers	.
On	its	own	,	Dentsu	's	muscle	in	Japan	may	count	for	little	in	major	foreign	markets	when	*	seeking	non-Japanese	clients	*T*-1	.
Thus	,	an	acquisition	may	prove	the	necessary	course	.
But	Japanese	agencies	are	cautious	about	*-1	expanding	abroad	because	client	relationships	are	different	.
Japanese	agencies	do	business	with	rival	clients	in	the	same	industry	,	a	practice	``	that	*T*-1	would	be	unacceptable	by	traditional	Western	conflict	rules	,	''	says	0	*T*-2	Roy	Warman	,	the	London	chief	executive	of	Saatchi	&	Saatchi	's	communications	division	.
Although	*	acquiring	a	foreign	company	would	expand	Japanese	advertising	agencies	'	business	to	foreign	clients	,	many	clients	would	also	be	Japanese	companies	expanding	overseas	,	says	0	*T*-1	the	Dentsu	spokesman	.
But	the	different	business	system	would	make	it	*ICH*-2	hard	for	Dentsu	to	provide	these	Japanese	companies	the	same	kind	of	services	0	they	do	*T*-1	in	Japan	.
Ciba-Geigy	AG	,	the	big	Swiss	chemicals	company	,	said	that	it	agreed	in	a	letter	of	intent	with	Corning	Inc.	*-1	to	acquire	Corning	's	50	%	share	of	Ciba	Corning	Diagnostics	Corp.	,	based	*	in	Medfield	,	Mass	.
Ciba	Corning	,	which	*T*-51	had	been	a	50-50	venture	between	Basel-based	Ciba-Geigy	and	Corning	,	has	annual	sales	of	about	$	300	million	*U*	,	the	announcement	said	0	*T*-1	.
Terms	of	the	transaction	were	n't	disclosed	*-1	.
Ciba	Corning	makes	clinical	diagnostics	systems	and	related	products	for	the	medical-care	industry	.
The	announcement	said	0	the	acquisition	should	be	completed	*-1	by	December	after	a	definitive	agreement	is	completed	*-2	and	regulatory	approval	is	received	*-3	.
Ciba-Geigy	intends	*-1	to	develop	the	Ciba	Corning	unit	into	a	``	substantial	business	,	''	*-2	making	the	unit	an	``	integral	part	''	of	Ciba-Geigy	's	``	comprehensive	disease	management	concept	.
The	NBC	network	canceled	its	first	new	series	of	the	fall	TV	season	,	*-1	killing	Mel	Brooks	's	wacky	hotel	comedy	``	The	Nutt	House	.	''
The	show	,	one	of	five	new	NBC	series	,	is	the	second	casualty	of	the	three	networks	so	far	this	fall	.
Last	week	CBS	Inc.	canceled	``	The	People	Next	Door	.	''
NBC	's	comedy	had	aired	Wednesdays	at	9:30	p.m.	and	in	five	outings	had	drawn	an	average	of	only	13.2	%	of	homes	,	*-1	lagging	behind	the	Jamie	Lee	Curtis	comedy	``	Anything	But	Love	''	on	ABC	and	CBS	's	one-hour	drama	``	Jake	and	the	Fatman	.	''
NBC	,	a	unit	of	General	Electric	Co.	,	has	n't	decided	on	a	permanent	replacement	for	the	canceled	series	.
John	Labatt	Ltd.	said	0	it	plans	a	private	placement	of	150	million	Canadian	dollars	-LRB-	US$	127.5	million	*U*	-RRB-	in	preferred	shares	,	0	*T*-2	to	be	completed	*-1	around	Nov.	1	.
Proceeds	will	be	used	*-1	*-2	to	reduce	short-term	debt	at	the	beer	and	food	concern	,	said	Robert	Vaux	,	vice	president	,	finance	.
The	preferred	shares	will	carry	a	floating	annual	dividend	equal	to	72	%	of	the	30-day	bankers	'	acceptance	rate	until	Dec.	31	,	1994	.
Thereafter	,	the	rate	will	be	renegotiated	*-1	.
Mr.	Vaux	said	that	if	no	agreement	is	reached	*-1	,	other	buyers	will	be	sought	*-2	by	bid	or	auction	.
The	shares	are	redeemable	after	the	end	of	1994	.
Mr.	Vaux	said	0	the	share	issue	is	part	of	a	strategy	0	*	to	strengthen	Labatt	's	balance	sheet	in	anticipation	of	acquisitions	0	*T*-3	to	be	made	*-1	during	the	next	12	to	18	months	*T*-2	.
Labatt	's	has	no	takeover	bids	outstanding	currently	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
Lead	underwriter	to	the	issue	is	Toronto	Dominion	Securities	Inc	.
Texas	Instruments	Inc.	,	*-1	once	a	pioneer	in	portable	computer	technology	,	today	will	make	a	bid	*	to	reassert	itself	in	that	business	by	*-2	unveiling	three	small	personal	computers	.
The	announcements	are	scheduled	*-3	to	be	made	*-1	in	Temple	,	Texas	,	and	include	a	so-called	``	notebook	''	PC	that	*T*-2	weighs	less	than	seven	pounds	,	has	a	built-in	hard	disk	drive	and	is	powered	*-4	by	Intel	Corp.	's	286	microprocessor	.
That	introduction	comes	only	two	weeks	after	Compaq	Computer	Corp.	,	*-1	believing	0	it	had	a	lead	of	three	to	six	months	on	competitors	,	introduced	the	first	U.S.	notebook	computer	with	such	features	.
Despite	the	inevitable	comparison	with	Compaq	,	however	,	Texas	Instruments	'	new	notebook	wo	n't	be	a	direct	competitor	.
While	Compaq	sells	its	machines	to	businesses	through	computer	retailers	,	Texas	Instruments	will	be	selling	most	of	its	machines	to	the	industrial	market	and	to	value-added	resellers	and	original-equipment	manufacturers	.
The	introductions	also	mark	Texas	Instruments	'	plunge	back	into	a	technology	0	it	has	all	but	ignored	*T*-1	for	the	past	several	years	.
Although	the	Dallas-based	computer	giant	introduced	the	first	portable	data	terminal	*ICH*-1	in	1971	--	a	38-pound	monster	--	and	the	world	's	first	microprocessor-based	portable	in	1976	,	the	only	portable	machines	0	it	has	introduced	*T*-4	since	the	first	part	of	the	decade	have	been	``	dumb	''	terminals	with	limited	on-board	processing	ability	.
It	stopped	*-1	selling	a	standard	personal	computer	a	while	ago	.
Now	that	is	about	*-1	to	change	,	as	Texas	Instruments	begins	*-2	marketing	two	14-pound	laptop	PCs	with	20	megabyte	and	40	megabyte	hard	drives	.
The	laptops	are	not	revolutionary	and	,	indeed	,	are	tardy	in	a	market	first	opened	*	by	GRiD	Systems	Corp.	,	now	a	unit	of	Tandy	Corp.	,	almost	two	years	ago	.
But	the	notebook	,	with	the	more	advanced	microprocessor	and	hard	disk	,	is	more	innovative	.
*-2	Weighing	6.7	pounds	with	battery	,	the	notebook	measures	8.2	by	11.7	inches	,	has	a	20-megabyte	hard	disk	drive	and	boasts	a	backlit	screen	that	*T*-1	is	22	%	larger	than	Compaq	's	.
Its	keyboard	,	according	to	industry	consultants	,	is	better	than	Compaq	's	,	but	its	battery	life	of	two	to	three	hours	is	shorter	.
It	does	n't	have	an	internal	floppy	disk	drive	,	although	a	snap-on	drive	can	be	purchased	*-1	separately	.
Its	greatest	drawback	may	be	its	3-inch	thickness	,	big	enough	for	one	consultant	to	describe	it	as	``	clunky	.	''
List	prices	on	the	heavier	Texas	Instrument	laptops	will	be	$	4,999	*U*	for	the	TI	Model	25	,	with	a	20	megabyte	disk	drive	,	and	$	5,599	*U*	for	the	40-megabyte	Model	45	.
The	notebook	,	the	TI	Model	12	,	will	be	priced	*-1	at	$	4,199	*U*	.
Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	Inc.	said	0	it	applied	to	Taiwanese	securities	officials	for	permission	*	to	open	brokerage	offices	in	Taipei	.
Shearson	's	application	is	the	first	since	the	Taiwan	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	announced	June	21	that	it	would	allow	foreign	brokerage	firms	to	do	business	in	that	country	.
Taiwan	officials	are	expected	*-1	to	review	the	Shearson	application	later	this	year	.
Under	current	rules	,	investors	in	Taiwan	can	buy	overseas	stocks	only	through	the	purchase	of	mutual	funds	issued	*	by	local	and	foreign	investment	trusts	.
The	new	rules	will	allow	investors	to	buy	foreign	stocks	directly	.
A	spokesman	for	Shearson	said	0	the	brokerage	service	will	be	directed	*-1	at	individual	investors	who	*T*-2	want	*-3	to	buy	foreign	and	domestic	stocks	.
``	It	's	an	attractive	market	with	good	growth	opportunities	,	''	he	added	*T*-1	.
Retailers	in	the	West	and	parts	of	the	South	are	entering	the	critical	Christmas	shopping	season	with	more	momentum	than	those	in	other	regions	.
In	a	new	report	,	the	International	Council	of	Shopping	Centers	said	0	sales	of	general	merchandise	in	the	West	for	the	first	seven	months	of	1989	rose	6.6	%	above	year-earlier	levels	.
Sales	increased	a	more	modest	4.8	%	in	the	South	and	4.4	%	in	the	Midwest	.
But	sales	in	the	oil-patch	state	of	Texas	surged	12.9	%	and	sales	in	South	Carolina	jumped	10.6	%	in	the	period	,	the	New	York	trade	group	said	0	*T*-1	.
In	the	Northeast	,	however	,	sales	declined	0.4	%	in	the	period	,	with	sales	in	New	England	falling	2.6	%	.
The	numbers	show	that	``	we	do	n't	have	a	monolithic	economy	,	''	said	*T*-1	Isaac	Lagnado	,	council	research	director	.
``	There	are	a	lot	of	have	and	have-not	markets	.	''
Sales	nationally	rose	3.9	%	through	July	,	the	latest	month	for	which	the	figures	are	available	*T*-2	,	the	council	said	0	*T*-1	.
The	Northern	California	earthquake	and	Hurricane	Hugo	are	likely	*-1	to	temporarily	damp	sales	growth	in	the	West	and	South	Carolina	.
But	Mr.	Lagnado	predicted	0	the	regional	trends	would	continue	through	Christmas	.
``	The	big	mo	is	as	much	of	a	factor	in	retailing	as	in	politics	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
The	Christmas	quarter	is	important	to	retailers	because	it	represents	roughly	a	third	of	their	sales	and	nearly	half	of	their	profits	.
The	council	's	report	is	based	*-1	on	data	0	the	trade	group	buys	*T*-2	from	the	U.S.	Census	Bureau	.
The	information	on	125	metropolitan	markets	is	supplied	*-1	by	retailers	such	as	Sears	,	Roebuck	&	Co.	and	K	mart	Corp.	as	well	as	closely	held	concerns	such	as	R.H.	Macy	&	Co	.
The	council	plans	*-1	to	release	its	regional	reports	monthly	.
Mr.	Lagnado	said	strength	in	employment	appears	*-1	to	have	the	biggest	impact	on	sales	growth	.
El	Paso	,	Austin	and	Fort	Worth	,	the	three	strongest	retail	markets	in	the	nation	,	are	all	located	*-1	in	Texas	,	where	employment	grew	a	relatively	strong	2	%	*T*-2	.
Massachusetts	,	which	*T*-1	has	lost	jobs	in	the	computer	and	defense-related	industries	,	was	the	weakest	link	in	bleak	New	England	.
The	results	reflect	a	reversal	in	the	fortunes	of	the	regions	during	the	past	two	years	.
In	1987	,	the	West	had	the	slowest	sales	growth	,	and	the	South	and	the	Midwest	were	first	and	second	respectively	,	according	to	the	council	.
Mr.	Lagnado	said	that	although	retailers	probably	wo	n't	ever	recover	sales	lost	*	because	of	the	California	quake	and	Hurricane	Hugo	,	they	could	see	some	benefits	later	on	.
Stores	such	as	Sears	that	*T*-1	sell	big-ticket	durable	goods	might	actually	get	a	boost	as	consumers	rush	*-3	to	replace	items	lost	*	in	the	disasters	,	he	said	0	*T*-2	.
Kerr-McGee	Corp.	said	0	it	will	spend	$	42	million	*U*	*-1	to	purchase	land	and	relocate	its	ammonium	perchlorate	storage	facility	to	Clark	County	,	Nev.	,	from	Henderson	,	Nev	.
The	company	said	0	it	will	move	the	storage	and	cross-blending	operations	to	a	site	23	miles	northeast	of	Las	Vegas	*-1	to	distance	the	operations	from	residential	areas	.
Ammonium	perchlorate	is	an	oxidizer	that	*T*-2	is	mixed	*-1	with	a	propellant	*	to	make	rocket	fuel	used	*	in	the	space	shuttle	and	military	rockets	.
In	May	1988	,	an	ammonium	perchlorate	plant	in	Henderson	owned	*	by	an	American	Pacific	Corp.	unit	was	leveled	*-1	by	a	series	of	explosions	.
After	the	explosion	,	Kerr-McGee	temporarily	shut	down	its	facility	just	south	of	Las	Vegas	for	a	safety	inspection	.
American	Pacific	and	Kerr-McGee	are	the	only	two	U.S.	manufacturers	of	ammonium	perchlorate	.
When	the	plant	was	destroyed	*-1	*T*-2	,	``	I	think	everyone	got	concerned	that	the	same	thing	would	happen	at	our	plant	,	''	a	KerrMcGee	spokeswoman	said	0	*T*-3	.
That	prompted	Kerr-McGee	to	consider	*-1	moving	the	potentially	volatile	storage	facilities	and	cross-blending	operations	away	from	town	.
Kerr-McGee	said	0	it	has	purchased	3,350	acres	from	the	federal	government	in	Clark	County	and	plans	*-1	to	begin	construction	early	next	year	.
The	new	facility	is	expected	*-1	to	begin	operations	in	early	1991	.
The	Henderson	plant	will	continue	its	other	chemical	operations	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-1	.
This	maker	of	electronic	devices	said	0	it	replaced	all	five	incumbent	directors	at	a	special	meeting	called	*	by	Milton	B.	Hollander	,	whose	High	Technology	Holding	Co.	of	Stamford	,	Conn.	*T*-1	acquired	most	of	its	49.4	%	stake	in	Newport	in	August	.
Elected	*-2	as	directors	were	*T*-1	Mr.	Hollander	,	Frederick	Ezekiel	,	Frederick	Ross	,	Arthur	B.	Crozier	and	Rose	Pothier	.

Newport	officials	did	n't	respond	Friday	to	requests	*	to	discuss	the	changes	at	the	company	but	earlier	,	Mr.	Weekes	had	said	0	Mr.	Hollander	wanted	*-1	to	have	his	own	team	on	the	board	.

Exact	comparisons	with	the	previous	year	were	unavailable	because	of	a	change	in	the	company	's	fiscal	calendar	.
The	Tokyo-based	company	had	net	of	3.73	billion	yen	in	the	previous	reporting	period	,	which	*T*-1	was	the	four	months	ended	March	31	.
Sales	in	the	first	half	came	to	159.92	billion	yen	,	compared	with	104.79	billion	yen	in	the	four-month	period	.
Shiseido	predicted	that	sales	for	the	year	ending	next	March	31	will	be	318	billion	yen	,	compared	with	340.83	billion	yen	in	the	year	ended	Nov.	30	,	1988	.
It	said	0	it	expects	net	to	rise	to	11	billion	yen	from	8.22	billion	yen	.
Bruce	W.	Wilkinson	,	president	and	chief	executive	officer	,	was	named	*-1	to	the	additional	post	of	chairman	of	this	architectural	and	design	services	concern	.

Merger	and	acquisition	activity	in	the	third	quarter	exceeded	the	year-earlier	pace	,	said	0	*T*-1	Merrill	Lynch	&	Co.	's	W.T.	Grimm	&	Co.	unit	in	Schaumburg	,	Ill	.
A	total	of	672	transactions	were	announced	*-1	during	the	latest	quarter	,	up	13	%	from	the	year-earlier	period	's	597	,	Grimm	said	0	*T*-3	.

*-1	Citing	current	stock	market	conditions	and	the	trend	away	from	highly	leveraged	transactions	,	Grimm	said	0	it	was	n't	certain	that	the	total	value	of	transactions	for	the	year	will	exceed	the	record	$	247	billion	*U*	in	1988	.
MEDICINE	SHOPPE	INTERNATIONAL	Inc.	declared	a	3-for-2	stock	split	,	and	substantially	boosted	the	dividend	payout	.
The	franchiser	of	pharmacies	said	0	the	added	shares	will	be	distributed	*-1	Dec.	4	to	stock	of	record	Nov.	13	.
The	company	also	changed	its	dividend	policy	,	under	which	holders	had	received	an	annual	10	cents-a-share	payment	*T*-2	,	by	*-4	declaring	a	four-cents-a-share	dividend	,	0	*T*-3	to	be	paid	*-1	quarterly	on	post-split	shares	.
NBI	Inc.	said	that	it	can	not	pay	the	Oct.	31	dividend	on	its	Series	A	convertible	preferred	stock	,	*	allowing	the	stock	's	holder	to	convert	the	shares	into	as	much	as	27.7	%	of	NBI	's	shares	outstanding	.
NBI	said	that	it	has	the	funds	0	*	to	pay	the	dividend	*T*-1	,	but	that	it	does	n't	have	the	surplus	or	profit	required	*	under	Delaware	law	for	payment	of	the	dividend	.

Failure	*	to	pay	the	dividend	allows	Yukon	to	convert	all	or	some	of	its	shares	into	NBI	common	after	Nov.	30	,	at	a	conversion	price	based	*	on	NBI	's	closing	stock	price	.
NBI	,	a	maker	of	word-processing	systems	,	said	0	it	ca	n't	predict	if	any	of	the	preferred	stock	will	be	converted	*-1	.

This	estimate	does	n't	include	claims	under	workers	'	compensation	,	life	,	health	disability	and	liability	insurance	and	damage	to	infrastructure	such	as	bridges	,	highways	and	public	buildings	.
The	estimated	earthquake	losses	are	low	compared	with	the	$	4	billion	*U*	in	claims	that	insurers	face	*T*-2	from	Hurricane	Hugo	,	which	*T*-1	ripped	through	the	Caribbean	and	the	Carolinas	last	month	.
That	's	because	only	about	30	%	of	California	homes	and	businesses	had	earthquake	insurance	0	*	to	cover	the	losses	*T*-1	.
However	,	insurance	brokers	and	executives	say	that	the	combination	of	the	Bay	area	earthquake	,	Hugo	and	last	week	's	explosion	at	the	Phillips	Petroleum	Co.	's	refinery	in	Pasadena	,	Texas	,	will	cause	property	insurance	and	reinsurance	rates	to	jump	.
Other	insurance	rates	such	as	casualty	insurance	,	which	*T*-1	would	cover	liability	claims	,	are	n't	likely	*-2	to	firm	right	away	,	says	0	*T*-3	Alice	Cornish	,	an	industry	analyst	with	Northington	Research	in	Avon	,	Conn	.
She	believes	0	the	impact	of	losses	from	these	catastrophes	is	n't	likely	*-1	to	halt	the	growth	of	the	industry	's	surplus	capital	next	year	.
Property	reinsurance	rates	are	likely	*-1	to	climb	first	,	analysts	and	brokers	believe	0	*T*-2	.
``	The	reinsurance	market	has	been	bloodied	*-2	by	disasters	''	in	the	U.S.	as	well	as	in	Great	Britain	and	Europe	,	says	0	*T*-1	Thomas	Rosencrants	,	director	of	research	at	Interstate\/Johnson	Lane	Inc.	in	Atlanta	.
Insurers	typically	retain	a	small	percentage	of	the	risks	0	they	underwrite	*T*-1	and	pass	on	the	rest	of	the	losses	.
Insurers	buy	this	insurance	protection	for	themselves	by	*-3	giving	up	a	portion	of	the	premiums	0	they	collect	*T*-2	on	a	policy	to	another	firm	--	a	reinsurance	company	,	which	,	in	turn	,	*T*-1	accepts	a	portion	of	any	losses	resulting	from	this	policy	.
Insurers	,	such	as	Cigna	Corp.	,	Transamerica	Corp	,	and	Aetna	Life	&	Casualty	Co.	,	buy	reinsurance	from	other	U.S.-based	companies	and	Lloyd	's	of	London	for	one	catastrophe	at	a	time	.
After	Hugo	hit	,	many	insurers	exhausted	their	reinsurance	coverage	and	had	*-1	to	tap	reinsurers	*-2	to	replace	that	coverage	in	case	there	were	any	other	major	disasters	before	the	end	of	the	year	.
After	the	earthquake	two	weeks	ago	,	brokers	say	0	companies	scrambled	*-1	to	replace	reinsurance	coverages	again	and	Lloyd	's	syndicates	turned	to	the	London	market	excess	lines	for	protection	of	their	own	.
James	Snedeker	,	senior	vice	president	of	Gill	&	Roeser	Inc.	,	a	New	York-based	reinsurance	broker	,	says	0	insurers	who	*T*-1	took	big	losses	this	fall	and	had	purchased	little	reinsurance	in	recent	years	will	be	asked	*-2	*-3	to	pay	some	pretty	hefty	rates	if	they	want	*-4	to	buy	reinsurance	for	1990	.
However	,	companies	with	few	catastrophe	losses	this	year	and	already	big	buyers	of	reinsurance	are	likely	*-1	to	see	their	rates	remain	flat	,	or	perhaps	even	decline	slightly	.
Many	companies	will	be	negotiating	their	1990	reinsurance	contracts	in	the	next	few	weeks	.
``	It	's	a	seller	's	market	,	''	said	*T*-1	Mr.	Snedeker	of	the	reinsurance	market	right	now	.
But	some	large	insurers	,	such	as	State	Farm	Mutual	Automobile	Insurance	Co.	,	do	n't	purchase	reinsurance	,	but	fund	their	own	program	.
A	few	years	ago	,	State	Farm	,	the	nation	's	largest	home	insurer	,	stopped	buying	reinsurance	because	no	one	carrier	could	provide	all	the	coverage	that	it	needed	*T*-2	and	the	company	found	it	*EXP*-1	cheaper	*	to	self-reinsure	.
The	$	472	million	*U*	of	losses	0	State	Farm	expects	*T*-1	from	Hugo	and	an	additional	$	300	million	*U*	from	the	earthquake	are	less	than	5	%	of	State	Farm	's	$	16.7	billion	*U*	total	net	worth	.
Since	few	insurers	have	announced	what	amount	of	losses	*ICH*-5	they	expect	*-1	to	see	*T*-3	from	the	earthquake	,	it	*EXP*-2	's	impossible	*	to	get	a	clear	picture	of	the	quake	's	impact	on	fourth-quarter	earnings	,	said	0	*T*-4	Herbert	Goodfriend	at	Prudential-Bache	Securities	Corp	.
Transamerica	expects	an	after-tax	charge	of	less	than	$	3	million	*U*	against	fourth-quarter	net	;	Hartford	Insurance	Group	,	a	unit	of	ITT	Corp.	,	expects	a	$	15	million	*U*	or	10	cents	after-tax	charge	;	and	Fireman	's	Fund	Corp.	expects	a	charge	of	no	more	than	$	50	million	*U*	before	taxes	and	after	*	using	its	reinsurance	.

Sales	of	information-processing	products	and	electric	parts	increased	a	strong	22	%	to	236.23	billion	yen	from	194.24	billion	yen	and	accounted	for	46	%	of	total	sales	.
In	audio	equipment	,	sales	rose	13	%	to	44.3	billion	yen	from	39.19	billion	yen	.
Sales	of	electric	appliances	were	flat	,	and	sales	of	electronic	equipment	declined	slightly	.
Sharp	projected	sales	for	the	current	year	ending	March	31	at	1.6	trillion	yen	,	a	7	%	increase	the	previous	fiscal	year	.
It	said	0	it	expects	net	to	rise	45	%	to	380	billion	yen	.
Sun	Microsystems	Inc.	,	a	computer	maker	,	announced	the	effectiveness	of	its	registration	statement	for	$	125	million	*U*	of	6	3\/8	%	convertible	subordinated	debentures	due	Oct.	15	,	1999	.
The	company	said	0	the	debentures	are	being	issued	*-1	at	an	issue	price	of	$	849	*U*	for	each	$	1,000	*U*	principal	amount	and	are	convertible	at	any	time	prior	to	maturity	at	a	conversion	price	of	$	25	*U*	a	share	.

Nelson	Holdings	International	Ltd.	shareholders	approved	a	1-for-10	consolidation	of	the	company	's	common	stock	at	a	special	meeting	.
At	the	same	time	,	shareholders	approved	the	adoption	of	a	rights	plan	and	a	super-majority	voting	approval	requirement	.
They	also	approved	the	relocation	of	the	company	's	registered	office	to	Toronto	from	Vancouver	and	a	name	change	to	NHI	Nelson	Holdings	International	Ltd	.
Following	the	consolidation	,	the	entertainment	company	,	which	*T*-1	has	film	and	television	operations	in	Beverly	Hills	,	Calif.	,	will	have	about	4.1	million	shares	outstanding	.
The	number	of	authorized	common	shares	will	remain	at	100	million	.

Under	the	super-majority	amendment	,	certain	mergers	and	other	transactions	would	require	approval	of	holders	of	80	%	of	the	company	's	common	shares	outstanding	.
Wilfred	American	Educational	Corp.	said	0	a	federal	grand	jury	in	Boston	indicted	the	operator	of	cosmetology	and	business	schools	for	mail	fraud	.
The	charges	in	the	12-count	indictment	,	which	*T*-1	stem	from	events	that	*T*-2	allegedly	occurred	in	late	1984	and	early	1985	,	involve	enrollment	procedures	of	six	students	and	the	preparation	of	certain	reports	,	Wilfred	said	0	*T*-3	.

Wilfred	American	said	0	it	will	``	vigorously	defend	''	itself	against	the	charges	and	added	that	the	charges	relate	to	procedures	that	it	has	since	changed	*T*-1	.
Eight	admissions	representatives	at	two	of	Wilfred	's	former	Massachusetts	schools	previously	pleaded	guilty	to	charges	of	*	aiding	,	abetting	and	counseling	students	to	submit	false	financial-aid	applications	.

Rally	's	,	a	Louisville	,	Ky.	,	fast-food	chain	,	alleges	that	the	three	investors	,	who	*T*-1	are	directors	of	the	company	,	broke	securities	laws	because	they	did	n't	disclose	their	intentions	*	to	acquire	a	big	Rally	's	stake	.
The	group	,	led	*	by	Giant	Group	Ltd.	and	its	chairman	,	Mr.	Sugarman	,	owns	about	45.2	%	of	Rally	's	.
In	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	filings	,	the	group	has	said	0	it	may	seek	control	of	Rally	's	.
Mr.	Sugarman	called	the	lawsuit	``	not	nice	''	and	said	0	his	group	will	continue	*-1	to	push	for	control	of	the	company	and	the	removal	of	certain	directors	.
He	asserts	that	some	directors	,	who	*T*-1	have	joined	forces	with	company	founder	James	Patterson	,	have	ties	to	Wendy	's	,	a	competing	hamburger	chain	.
The	Patterson	group	,	which	*T*-1	controls	about	42	%	of	Rally	's	shares	,	also	may	seek	control	.

The	13.25	%	subordinated	debentures	due	2002	were	issued	*-1	in	August	1987	as	part	of	the	$	690	million	*U*	financing	for	a	leveraged	buy-out	of	the	company	.
Leaseway	provides	transportation	services	for	manufacturers	,	distributors	and	retailers	.

Specific	terms	are	subject	to	review	and	a	final	agreement	with	debt	holders	,	the	company	said	0	*T*-1	.
But	the	proposed	transaction	calls	for	an	exchange	of	the	debt	for	new	debentures	of	lower	face	value	and	reduced	cash	interest	.
Also	,	debt	holders	would	be	offered	*-2	an	equity	position	in	Leaseway	,	which	in	total	*T*-3	would	represent	a	controlling	interest	in	the	company	.
Drexel	Burnham	Lambert	Inc.	is	the	adviser	on	the	transaction	.
Company	officials	said	0	Leaseway	fulfilled	payment	requirements	of	its	debt	obligations	since	the	leveraged	buy-out	,	but	0	``	our	performance	since	the	-LCB-	buy-out	-RCB-	makes	it	*EXP*-2	imperative	*	to	implement	actions	that	*T*-1	will	further	improve	our	cash	flow	.
Nicaraguan	President	Daniel	Ortega	may	have	accomplished	over	the	weekend	what	his	U.S.	antagonists	have	failed	*-1	to	do	*T*-2	:	*	revive	a	constituency	for	the	Contra	rebels	.
Lawmakers	have	n't	publicly	raised	the	possibility	of	*	renewing	military	aid	to	the	Contras	,	and	President	Bush	parried	the	question	at	a	news	conference	here	Saturday	,	*-1	saying	only	that	``	if	there	's	an	all-out	military	offensive	,	that	's	going	*-2	to	change	the	equation	180	degrees	.	''
But	Mr.	Ortega	's	threat	over	the	weekend	*	to	end	a	19-month	cease-fire	with	the	rebels	seeking	*	to	topple	him	,	effectively	elevated	the	Contras	as	a	policy	priority	just	as	they	were	slipping	from	the	agendas	of	their	most	ardent	supporters	.
Senate	Majority	Leader	George	Mitchell	-LRB-	D.	,	Maine	-RRB-	said	yesterday	on	NBC-TV	's	``	*	Meet	the	Press	''	that	Mr.	Ortega	's	threat	*ICH*-3	was	``	a	very	unwise	move	,	particularly	the	timing	of	it	.	''
The	threat	came	during	a	two-day	celebration	in	Costa	Rica	0	*T*-1	to	highlight	Central	America	's	progress	toward	democracy	in	the	region	,	attended	*	by	President	Bush	,	Canadian	Prime	Minister	Brian	Mulroney	and	14	other	Western	Hemisphere	leaders	.
Mr.	Bush	returned	to	Washington	Saturday	night	.
Mr.	Ortega	announced	on	Friday	that	he	would	end	the	cease-fire	this	week	in	response	to	the	periodic	Contra	assaults	against	his	army	.
Saturday	,	he	amended	his	remarks	*-1	to	say	that	he	would	continue	*-2	to	abide	by	the	cease-fire	if	the	U.S.	ends	its	financial	support	for	the	Contras	.
He	asked	that	the	remaining	U.S.	humanitarian	aid	be	diverted	*-1	to	*	disarming	and	demobilizing	the	rebels	.
Not	only	did	Mr.	Ortega	's	comments	come	in	the	midst	of	what	*T*-2	was	intended	*-1	as	a	showcase	for	the	region	,	it	came	as	Nicaragua	is	under	special	international	scrutiny	in	anticipation	of	its	planned	February	elections	.
Outside	observers	are	gathering	in	Nicaragua	*-1	to	monitor	the	registration	and	treatment	of	opposition	candidates	.
And	important	U.S.	lawmakers	must	decide	at	the	end	of	November	if	the	Contras	are	*-1	to	receive	the	rest	of	the	$	49	million	*U*	in	so-called	humanitarian	assistance	under	a	bipartisan	agreement	reached	*	with	the	Bush	administration	in	March	.
The	humanitarian	assistance	,	which	*T*-1	pays	for	supplies	such	as	food	and	clothing	for	the	rebels	amassed	*	along	the	Nicaraguan	border	with	Honduras	,	replaced	the	military	aid	cut	*	off	by	Congress	in	February	1988	.
While	few	lawmakers	anticipated	that	the	humanitarian	aid	would	be	cut	*-2	off	next	month	,	Mr.	Ortega	's	threat	practically	guarantees	that	the	humanitarian	aid	will	be	continued	*-1	.
Senate	Minority	Leader	Robert	Dole	-LRB-	R.	,	Kan	.	-RRB-	said	yesterday	on	``	*	Meet	the	Press	''	:	``	I	would	hope	0	after	his	-LCB-	Mr.	Ortega	's	-RCB-	act	yesterday	or	the	day	before	,	we	'd	have	unanimous	support	for	quick	action	on	remaining	humanitarian	aid	.	''
Sen.	Dole	also	said	0	he	hoped	for	unanimous	support	for	a	resolution	0	he	plans	*-1	to	offer	*T*-2	tomorrow	denouncing	the	Nicaraguan	leader	.
While	*	renewing	military	aid	had	been	considered	*T*-1	out	of	the	question	,	*-1	rejected	*-2	by	Congress	and	de-emphasized	*-2	by	the	Bush	administration	,	Mr.	Ortega	's	statement	provides	Contra	supporters	with	the	opportunity	*	to	press	the	administration	on	the	issue	.
``	The	administration	should	now	state	that	if	the	-LCB-	February	-RCB-	election	is	voided	*-1	by	the	Sandinistas	...	they	should	call	for	military	aid	,	''	said	*T*-2	former	Assistant	Secretary	of	State	Elliott	Abrams	.
``	In	these	circumstances	,	I	think	0	they	'd	win	.	''
Sen.	Mitchell	said	that	congressional	Democrats	intend	*-1	to	honor	the	March	agreement	*	to	give	non-lethal	support	to	the	Contras	through	the	February	elections	,	although	he	added	that	the	agreement	requires	that	the	Contras	not	initiate	any	military	action	.
Mr.	Ortega	's	threat	*	to	breach	the	cease-fire	comes	as	U.S.	officials	were	acknowledging	that	the	Contras	have	at	times	violated	it	themselves	.
Secretary	of	State	James	Baker	,	who	*T*-1	accompanied	President	Bush	to	Costa	Rica	,	told	reporters	Friday	:	``	I	have	no	reason	0	*	to	deny	reports	that	some	Contras	ambushed	some	Sandinista	soldiers	*T*-2	.	''
Mr.	Baker	's	assistant	for	inter-American	affairs	,	Bernard	Aronson	,	while	*-1	maintaining	that	the	Sandinistas	had	also	broken	the	cease-fire	,	acknowledged	:	``	It	*EXP*-2	's	never	very	clear	who	*T*-3	starts	what	.	''
He	added	that	the	U.S.	has	cut	off	aid	to	some	rebel	units	when	it	was	determined	*-1	that	those	units	broke	the	cease-fire	*T*-2	.
In	addition	to	*	undermining	arguments	in	favor	of	*	ending	Contra	aid	,	Mr.	Ortega	's	remarks	also	played	to	the	suspicions	of	some	U.S.	officials	and	conservatives	outside	the	government	that	he	is	searching	for	ways	0	*	to	manipulate	or	void	the	February	elections	*T*-1	.
Administration	officials	traveling	with	President	Bush	in	Costa	Rica	interpreted	Mr.	Ortega	's	wavering	as	a	sign	that	he	is	n't	responding	to	the	military	attacks	so	much	as	he	is	searching	for	ways	0	*	to	strengthen	his	hand	prior	to	the	elections	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Abrams	said	that	Mr.	Ortega	is	seeking	*-1	to	demobilize	the	Contras	prior	to	the	elections	*-2	to	remove	any	pressure	*	to	hold	fair	elections	.
``	My	sense	is	0	what	they	have	*T*-2	in	mind	is	an	excuse	for	*	clamping	down	on	campaigning	''	by	*-3	creating	an	atmosphere	of	a	military	emergency	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
Milton	Petrie	,	chairman	of	Petrie	Stores	Corp.	,	said	0	he	has	agreed	*-1	to	sell	his	15.2	%	stake	in	Deb	Shops	Corp.	to	Petrie	Stores	.
In	a	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	filing	,	Mr.	Petrie	said	that	on	Oct.	26	Petrie	Stores	agreed	*-1	to	purchase	Mr.	Petrie	's	2,331,100	Deb	Shops	shares	.
The	transaction	will	take	place	tomorrow	.
The	filing	said	0	Petrie	Stores	of	Secaucus	,	N.J.	,	is	purchasing	Mr.	Petrie	's	Deb	Shops	stake	as	an	investment	.
Although	Petrie	Stores	has	considered	*	seeking	*-1	to	acquire	the	remaining	equity	of	Deb	Stores	,	it	has	no	current	intention	*	to	pursue	such	a	possibility	,	the	filing	said	0	*T*-3	.
Philadelphia-based	Deb	Shops	said	0	it	saw	little	significance	in	Mr.	Petrie	selling	his	stock	to	Petrie	Stores	.

He	said	0	Gulf	Canada	will	likely	report	an	extraordinary	gain	from	the	sale	in	the	fourth	quarter	,	but	he	would	n't	offer	a	specific	estimate	.
The	transaction	is	expected	*-1	to	close	by	Nov.	30	.

The	New	York	Mercantile	Exchange	,	the	world	's	chief	oil	futures	marketplace	,	is	at	a	critical	juncture	.
Several	longtime	observers	of	the	commodities	industry	think	0	the	fortunes	of	the	Merc	over	the	next	decade	will	be	determined	*-1	to	a	large	extent	by	how	well	its	new	natural	gas	futures	contract	does	*T*-3	and	how	successful	its	new	president	is	*T*-2	in	*-4	raising	the	level	of	compliance	by	floor	traders	with	exchange	and	Commodity	Futures	Trading	Commission	rules	.
If	the	exchange	falters	in	these	moves	,	they	say	0	*T*-1	,	it	might	once	again	fall	behind	its	chief	New	York	competitor	,	the	Commodity	Exchange	.
On	Friday	,	the	Merc	's	board	announced	that	it	had	approved	Sabine	Pipe	Line	Co.	's	Henry	Hub	in	Erath	,	La.	,	as	the	delivery	site	for	its	long-awaited	natural	gas	futures	contract	.
It	also	said	that	it	would	start	*-1	trading	the	contract	as	soon	as	the	CFTC	approved	it	.
The	CFTC	has	90	days	0	*	to	respond	to	such	applications	*T*-1	.
The	Merc	first	started	*-1	working	on	*-2	developing	this	contract	in	1984	.
Only	three	weeks	earlier	,	the	Merc	had	turned	to	one	of	its	own	executives	,	40-year-old	R.	Patrick	Thompson	,	*	to	replace	Rosemary	T.	McFadden	as	president	.
Mr.	Thompson	is	believed	*-2	to	have	a	mandate	*ICH*-3	from	the	board	of	directors	*	to	help	*-4	improve	the	Merc	's	tarnished	reputation	as	an	exchange	whose	floor	traders	*T*-1	do	n't	follow	the	rules	very	well	.
Ms.	McFadden	had	been	forced	*-1	out	in	July	in	a	bitter	power	struggle	with	Z.	Lou	Guttman	,	chairman	and	a	longtime	floor	trader	on	the	exchange	.
Mr.	Guttman	told	one	person	familiar	with	the	New	York	exchanges	during	the	search	for	a	replacement	that	he	was	looking	for	a	president	who	*T*-1	would	be	``	responsive	to	the	needs	of	the	membership	and	the	board	.	''
Mr.	Thompson	first	came	to	the	exchange	in	1981	and	has	been	executive	vice	president	since	March	1988	.
He	previously	held	posts	of	senior	vice	president	of	compliance	and	senior	vice	president	and	general	counsel	.
By	contrast	,	the	Comex	in	July	imported	a	highly	regarded	outsider	,	Arnold	F.	Staloff	,	as	its	president	.
Mr.	Staloff	,	44	,	was	a	senior	officer	of	the	Philadelphia	Stock	Exchange	and	is	considered	*-1	a	specialist	in	new	financial	products	.
Mr.	Thompson	is	n't	bereft	of	experience	with	new	products	,	however	.
For	the	past	two	years	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	,	he	and	the	exchange	's	research	department	have	been	working	on	the	new	natural	gas	contract	,	*-2	seeking	a	good	delivery	site	and	studying	the	natural	gas	market	.
``	Our	members	are	eager	*-1	to	begin	*-2	trading	this	contract	,	so	we	expect	no	difficulty	in	*	attracting	locals	to	the	natural	gas	pit	,	''	he	said	0	*T*-3	.
The	educational	effort	of	*	teaching	companies	in	the	natural	gas	industry	how	*-5	to	use	the	futures	*T*-1	*-2	to	hedge	would	have	*-3	to	continue	for	another	a	year	or	two	,	he	added	0	*T*-4	.
The	Merc	's	extremely	successful	contracts	in	crude	oil	,	gasoline	and	heating	oil	have	made	it	the	largest	futures	exchange	in	New	York	,	and	third	behind	the	Chicago	Board	of	Trade	and	Chicago	Mercantile	Exchange	.
In	a	recent	interview	,	Mr.	Thompson	said	0	the	biggest	problem	facing	all	commodity	exchanges	was	one	of	image	.
Earlier	this	year	,	the	U.S.	attorney	indicted	45	floor	traders	*RNR*-1	and	one	clerk	*RNR*-1	at	the	two	big	Chicago	exchanges	.
Federal	authorities	in	New	York	started	investigating	exchanges	in	May	,	though	no	indictments	have	been	handed	down	*-1	there	.
So	far	they	have	issued	scores	of	subpoenas	,	some	of	which	*T*-1	went	to	members	of	the	New	York	Merc	.
Mr.	Thompson	will	have	*-1	to	face	some	of	the	consequences	of	those	subpoenas	.
In	a	recent	General	Accounting	Office	study	,	the	Merc	was	found	*-1	to	have	been	the	most	lax	in	*	enforcing	exchange	rules	.
It	levied	the	smallest	number	of	suspensions	of	traders	and	fines	of	the	four	largest	commodity	exchanges	studied	*	over	the	past	five	years	.
It	also	had	both	the	fewest	,	and	least	experienced	,	investigators	per	million	contracts	traded	*	.
The	Merc	received	considerable	criticism	in	1987	when	it	was	discovered	that	its	compliance	director	,	Kevin	P.	Conway	,	who	*T*-4	then	was	responsible	for	*	policing	the	exchange	's	busy	oil	and	metal	pits	,	``	was	engaged	*-3	in	other	personal	business	activities	*ICH*-1	on	Exchange	time	,	''	including	out-of-state	trips	,	according	to	a	New	York	Merc	report	prepared	*	last	year	*T*-6	.
Mr.	Conway	is	no	longer	at	the	exchange	.
``	We	had	a	management	breakdown	in	1987	in	terms	of	compliance	,	''	Mr.	Thompson	says	*T*-1	.
``	We	recognized	the	problem	and	took	care	of	it	.	''
He	says	that	even	if	the	natural	gas	contract	boosts	volume	at	the	exchange	strongly	,	the	1990	business	plan	calls	for	*	having	adequate	compliance	people	0	*T*-2	to	ensure	that	exchange	rules	are	being	followed	*-1	.
For	years	the	five	New	York	exchanges	have	been	talking	about	*	cooperating	in	various	aspects	of	their	business	in	order	*-1	to	improve	the	efficiency	of	their	operations	.
Periodically	,	there	has	even	been	talk	of	mergers	between	one	or	more	exchanges	.
So	far	there	is	little	0	*	to	show	*T*-1	for	such	efforts	.
Mr.	Thompson	believes	0	the	case	for	*	working	together	is	stronger	*ICH*-1	now	than	ever	.
``	The	cost	of	competition	has	become	extremely	high	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	We	must	find	ways	0	*	to	save	money	for	the	futures	commission	merchants	who	*T*-1	do	business	on	our	exchanges	*T*-2	.	''
He	thinks	that	progress	in	cooperation	can	be	made	*-1	in	areas	where	no	vested	interests	have	built	up	*T*-2	.
One	of	those	areas	is	the	development	of	a	hand-held	electronic	device	that	*T*-1	would	permit	floor	traders	to	enter	trades	as	they	make	them	.
The	GAO	has	recommended	the	creation	of	a	system	0	*	to	record	trade	data	*T*-2	so	that	an	independent	,	verifiable	audit	trail	can	be	established	*-1	*	to	prevent	customer	fraud	.
The	Merc	is	now	cooperating	with	the	Comex	in	*	developing	such	a	device	0	*T*-1	to	provide	such	an	audit	trail	.
The	Chicago	exchanges	also	are	working	on	such	a	device	.
Another	major	electronics	problem	*ICH*-2	faces	Mr.	Thompson	--	the	creation	of	a	24-hour	trading	system	that	*T*-4	can	be	used	*-3	outside	normal	trading	hours	.
In	January	,	the	New	York	Merc	signed	a	letter	of	intent	with	the	Chicago	Merc	as	a	preliminary	step	to	*	joining	their	electronic	system	0	*T*-1	called	*-2	Globex	.
But	in	May	,	the	Chicago	Merc	said	0	it	was	looking	into	*-1	creating	a	common	system	with	the	Chicago	Board	of	Trade	,	and	it	suspended	negotiations	with	the	New	York	Merc	.
Mr.	Thompson	says	0	his	exchange	is	n't	waiting	for	the	results	of	the	Chicago	exchanges	'	cooperation	.
It	recently	began	a	pilot	program	0	*T*-1	to	test	an	electronic	trading	system	called	*	ATS\/2	,	the	automated	trading	system	created	*	by	the	International	Commodities	Clearing	House	.
*	Looking	ahead	to	commodity	markets	this	week	:
Copper
Michael	Frawley	,	metals	trader	for	PaineWebber	Inc.	in	New	York	,	said	0	there	is	good	technical	support	between	$	1.10	and	$	1.12	*U*	a	pound	for	December	copper	,	which	*T*-1	ended	Friday	at	$	1.1580	*U*	a	pound	,	up	1.6	cents	.
He	views	the	$	1.10	to	$	1.12	*U*	range	as	a	buying	opportunity	and	considers	the	market	oversold	*-1	.
``	I	think	0	the	market	could	pop	up	to	the	$	1.22	to	$	1.25	*U*	level	without	too	much	difficulty	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
But	he	said	0	it	wo	n't	climb	further	and	he	expects	it	to	remain	in	a	trading	range	between	$	1.10	and	$	1.25	*U*	.
He	noted	that	the	equity	markets	will	set	the	tone	for	the	industrial	metals	this	week	and	traders	should	keep	an	eye	on	Wall	Street	.
William	O'Neill	,	research	director	for	Elders	Futures	Inc.	in	New	York	,	said	0	for	a	rally	to	occur	,	there	must	be	demand	from	the	Far	East	.
He	added	that	talk	of	strike	settlements	at	producing	mines	has	been	fully	discounted	*-1	.
However	,	*-1	to	resume	the	bull	trend	,	according	to	Mr.	O'Neill	,	copper	would	have	*-1	to	close	over	$	1.19	*U*	.
He	said	0	there	are	two	reports	*ICH*-2	*ICH*-3	this	week	that	*T*-1	might	affect	prices	:	the	purchasing	managers	report	on	Wednesday	and	the	unemployment	report	on	Friday	.
Precious	Metals
Friday	's	strong	price	gains	confirmed	a	turnaround	in	the	precious	metals	markets	,	according	to	PaineWebber	's	Mr.	Frawley	.
``	Most	traders	will	be	looking	*-1	to	buy	-LCB-	on	-RCB-	pullbacks	,	''	he	said	*T*-2	.
He	thought	the	moves	in	the	metals	last	week	were	most	influenced	*-1	by	the	uncertainty	in	the	equity	and	other	financial	markets	.
According	to	Mr.	Frawley	,	floor	traders	say	0	there	is	good	support	for	December	gold	in	the	$	374	to	$	375	*U*	per	ounce	area	,	around	$	5.20	*U*	an	ounce	for	December	silver	and	in	the	$	485	to	$	490	*U*	an	ounce	range	for	January	platinum	.
William	O'Neill	,	research	director	for	Elders	Futures	Inc.	in	New	York	,	said	the	price	action	for	all	of	last	week	is	the	best	0	he	has	seen	*T*-1	on	a	weekly	basis	in	more	than	a	year	.
He	said	0	last	week	's	activity	in	gold	could	portend	a	move	to	$	390	*U*	an	ounce	for	the	December	contract	.
He	also	said	0	traders	should	keep	an	eye	on	the	stock	market	,	because	``	if	the	stock	market	rallies	,	that	could	spell	trouble	for	the	precious	metals	.	''
He	said	0	traders	should	be	on	the	lookout	for	how	metals	producers	react	to	this	rally	*T*-1	.
``	I	expect	*-1	to	see	some	selling	,	but	will	they	kill	this	one	as	they	have	*?*	every	rally	in	the	recent	past	''	by	*-2	selling	and	locking	in	prices	for	their	production	?
He	noted	that	for	the	first	time	in	months	there	was	some	light	investor	interest	in	the	metals	.
Grains	And	Soybeans
Prices	this	week	will	likely	be	dominated	*-1	by	reports	on	the	progress	of	the	corn	and	soybean	harvest	as	well	as	by	speculation	about	more	purchases	of	U.S.	crops	by	the	Soviet	Union	.
In	recent	weeks	,	warm	and	dry	weather	has	sped	the	Midwest	harvest	and	that	is	permitting	farmers	to	rebuild	the	stockpiles	that	*T*-2	were	cut	*-1	by	the	1988	drought	.
If	the	weather	allowed	farmers	to	work	in	their	fields	over	the	weekend	,	many	Midwest	grain	elevators	will	probably	sell	futures	contracts	today	at	the	Chicago	Board	of	Trade	in	order	*-1	to	hedge	their	weekend	purchases	from	farmers	.
That	selling	of	futures	contracts	by	elevators	is	what	*T*-1	helps	*-2	keep	downward	pressure	on	crop	prices	during	the	harvest	.
Traders	will	also	watch	for	whether	the	Soviet	Union	continues	its	traditional	fall	buying	of	U.S.	grain	.
So	far	this	month	,	the	Soviets	have	bought	about	7.2	million	metric	tons	of	U.S.	corn	.
There	may	be	some	activity	in	soybean	prices	this	week	as	investors	try	*-1	to	get	rid	of	the	contract	for	November	delivery	.
Investors	usually	do	n't	want	*-1	to	take	physical	delivery	of	a	contract	,	*-1	preferring	instead	*-2	to	profit	from	its	price	swings	and	then	end	any	obligation	*	to	take	delivery	or	make	delivery	as	it	nears	expiration	.
Employees	of	the	Globe	and	Mail	,	a	Thomson	Corp.	newspaper	in	Toronto	,	voted	*-1	to	accept	a	tentative	contract	agreement	Saturday	,	*-1	averting	a	strike	at	Canada	's	leading	daily	.
Under	the	terms	of	the	three-year	contract	,	similar	to	one	reached	*	at	Torstar	Corp.	's	Toronto	Star	newspaper	earlier	this	month	,	the	500	Globe	and	Mail	workers	will	see	a	raise	of	8	%	in	the	contract	's	first	year	and	7	%	in	each	of	the	following	two	years	.
Lorne	Slotnick	,	vice	chairman	of	the	Southern	Ontario	Newspaper	Guild	,	the	union	representing	the	workers	,	said	0	Thomson	made	significant	concessions	in	the	final	round	of	talks	.
In	addition	to	wage	increases	,	the	union	negotiated	improved	vacation	plans	,	benefit	packages	and	pension	plans	,	Mr.	Slotnick	said	0	*T*-1	.
He	said	0	more	than	70	%	of	the	bargaining	unit	voted	in	favor	of	the	agreement	.
Wall	Street	is	just	about	ready	*-1	to	line	the	bird	cage	with	paper	stocks	.
For	three	years	,	a	healthy	economy	and	the	export-boosting	effects	of	a	weak	dollar	propelled	sales	and	earnings	of	the	big	paper	companies	to	record	levels	.
As	the	good	times	rolled	they	more	than	doubled	their	prices	for	pulp	,	a	raw	material	used	*	in	all	sorts	of	paper	,	to	$	830	*U*	a	metric	ton	this	past	spring	from	$	380	*U*	a	ton	at	the	start	of	1986	.
But	now	the	companies	are	getting	into	trouble	because	they	undertook	a	record	expansion	program	while	they	were	raising	prices	sharply	.
Third-quarter	profits	*ICH*-1	fell	at	several	companies	.

Lawrence	Ross	of	PaineWebber	would	avoid	Union	Camp	.
The	companies	in	question	believe	0	the	analysts	are	too	pessimistic	.
Great	Northern	Nekoosa	said	,	``	The	odds	of	the	dire	predictions	about	us	being	right	are	small	.	''
International	Paper	emphasizes	that	it	is	better	positioned	than	most	companies	for	the	coming	overcapacity	because	its	individual	mills	can	make	more	than	one	grade	of	paper	.
A	Boise-Cascade	spokesman	referred	to	a	speech	by	Chairman	John	Fery	,	in	which	he	said	that	markets	generally	are	stable	,	although	some	risk	of	further	price	deterioration	exists	*T*-1	.
Stone	Container	Chairman	Roger	Stone	said	that	,	unlike	for	some	other	paper	products	,	demand	for	Stone	's	principal	commodity	,	unbleached	containerboard	,	remains	strong	.
He	expects	the	price	for	that	product	to	rise	even	more	next	year	.
Gaylord	Container	said	0	analysts	are	skeptical	of	it	because	it	's	carrying	a	lot	of	debt	.

The	restaurant	operator	cited	transaction	costs	from	its	1988	recapitalization	as	a	result	of	a	$	160	million	*U*	restructuring	of	its	bank	debt	.
The	write-off	will	be	reported	*-1	as	an	extraordinary	item	in	the	company	's	1989	operating	results	.
In	addition	,	the	effective	interest	rate	on	the	$	410	million	*U*	of	total	remaining	bank	debt	after	the	restructuring	is	10.66	%	.
The	combined	effect	of	these	changes	is	expected	*-1	to	save	the	company	about	$	4	million	*U*	in	interest	expenses	next	year	,	or	six	cents	a	share	.

ABB	Asea	Brown	Boveri	B.V.	said	0	it	signed	a	contract	for	the	largest-ever	power	plant	order	in	the	Netherlands	.
ABB	said	0	the	contract	,	signed	*	with	the	Dutch	utility	N.V	.	Energieproduktiebedrijf	UNA	,	is	valued	*-1	in	excess	of	$	200	million	*U*	.
The	accord	is	for	a	turbogenerator	plant	at	the	coal-fired	power	station	Hemweg	in	Amsterdam	.
ABB	Asea	Brown	Boveri	is	the	Dutch	unit	of	the	Swedish-Swiss	electrical	engineering	group	ABB	Asea	Brown	Boveri	AG	.

Mr.	Kume	made	the	earnings	projection	for	fiscal	1990	,	ending	next	March	31	,	in	an	interview	with	U.S.	automotive	writers	attending	the	Tokyo	Motor	Show	.
The	executive	said	that	the	anticipated	earnings	increase	is	fairly	modest	because	Nissan	is	spending	heavily	*-1	to	bolster	its	dealership	network	in	Japan	and	because	of	currency-exchange	fluctuations	.
During	the	next	decade	,	Mr.	Kume	said	0	*T*-1	,	Nissan	plans	*-2	to	boost	overseas	vehicle	production	sufficiently	*	to	account	for	a	majority	of	sales	outside	Japan	.
Last	year	,	Mr.	Kume	said	0	*T*-1	,	Nissan	exported	slightly	over	one	million	vehicles	,	and	produced	570,000	cars	and	trucks	at	its	factories	in	North	America	,	Europe	and	Australia	.
But	by	1992	,	he	added	0	*T*-1	,	Nissan	will	build	one	million	vehicles	a	year	outside	Japan	,	or	sufficient	*	to	equal	exports	.
``	By	the	end	of	the	1990s	,	''	he	said	*T*-4	,	``	we	want	*-2	to	be	producing	roughly	two	vehicles	*ICH*-3	overseas	for	every	vehicle	that	we	export	*T*-1	from	Japan	.	''

National	Intergroup	Inc.	said	0	it	expects	*-1	to	report	a	charge	of	$	5.3	million	*U*	related	*	to	the	sale	of	its	aluminum	unit	's	extrusion	division	for	the	third	quarter	.
The	company	said	0	it	has	agreed	*-1	to	sell	the	extrusion	division	for	$	15	million	*U*	to	R.D.	Werner	Co.	,	a	closely	held	firm	based	*	in	Greenville	,	Pa	.
The	charge	is	offset	*-1	by	an	after-tax	gain	of	about	$	30	million	*U*	in	the	quarter	from	the	previously	announced	pact	*	to	sell	National	Aluminum	's	rolling	division	.
National	Intergroup	in	the	year-ago	third	quarter	earned	$	22.5	million	*U*	,	or	97	cents	a	share	,	including	a	gain	of	$	18	million	*U*	from	the	sale	of	a	steel	tube	company	.
Revenue	was	$	778.6	million	*U*	.
The	company	also	said	0	it	continues	*-1	to	explore	all	options	concerning	the	possible	sale	of	National	Aluminum	's	54.5	%	stake	in	an	aluminum	smelter	in	Hawesville	,	Ky	.
The	sale	of	the	extrusion	division	is	subject	to	audit	adjustments	for	working	capital	changes	through	the	closing	.
The	agreement	also	provides	for	potential	payments	of	additional	proceeds	to	National	Aluminum	over	the	next	two	years	,	depending	on	the	plant	's	shipping	levels	.
The	extrusion	unit	produces	bare	and	painted	custom	extrusions	for	building	products	and	construction	industries	.
In	fiscal	1989	,	it	had	sales	of	about	$	40	million	*U*	and	an	operating	loss	of	$	1.5	million	*U*	.
The	municipal	bond	market	is	bracing	for	tough	times	through	the	end	of	the	year	as	it	struggles	*-1	to	absorb	an	oversupply	of	bonds	and	two	of	its	best	customers	turn	into	sellers	.
Commercial	banks	and	property\/casualty	insurers	,	which	*T*-1	together	own	about	36	%	of	all	municipal	bonds	,	have	been	dumping	their	securities	for	weeks	.
Last	week	,	traders	said	0	*T*-1	,	there	were	three	institutional	sellers	for	every	buyer	.
``	Every	day	we	're	getting	new	bid	lists	''	from	would-be	sellers	,	one	trader	said	0	*T*-1	.
``	Most	dealers	can	not	continue	*-1	to	absorb	this	supply	.	''
As	a	result	,	yields	on	long-term	muni	bonds	now	stand	at	about	95	%	of	long-term	Treasury	yields	,	the	highest	such	level	in	more	than	two	years	.
``	There	is	incredible	negative	psychology	building	in	the	market	,	''	said	*T*-1	Donna	Avedisian	,	a	vice	president	at	Merrill	Lynch	&	Co	.
``	People	are	very	concerned	about	who	*T*-1	is	going	*-2	to	step	up	to	the	plate	and	buy	municipal	bonds	in	the	absence	of	institutional	buyers	.	''
The	yield	on	a	group	of	25	revenue	bonds	compiled	*	by	the	Bond	Buyer	,	a	trade	publication	,	now	exceeds	7.50	%	.
At	this	week	's	New	York	City	bond	sale	,	traders	expect	yields	on	the	20-year	New	York	bonds	to	nearly	match	the	7.9	%	yield	on	30-year	Treasury	bonds	.
For	an	investor	in	the	28	%	federal	tax	bracket	,	7.9	%	tax-free	is	the	same	as	10.38	%	on	a	taxable	investment	.
That	's	a	taxable-equivalent	yield	nearly	three	percentage	points	more	than	the	current	yield	on	30-year	Treasury	bonds	.
How	quickly	things	change	*T*-1	.
This	past	summer	,	investors	'	appetite	for	municipal	bonds	seemed	insatiable	.
Individuals	eager	for	tax-free	income	drove	up	bond	prices	,	*-1	making	state	and	local	government	debt	one	of	the	best-performing	types	of	fixed-income	investments	during	the	period	.
But	while	analysts	say	that	municipal	bonds	still	offer	good	value	,	you	would	n't	know	it	by	the	way	0	institutional	investors	are	rushing	*-1	to	dump	their	holdings	*T*-2	.
Bond	market	analysts	say	0	the	institutional	selling	was	triggered	*-1	by	several	factors	.
Big	banks	such	as	Chemical	Bank	and	Chase	Manhattan	,	which	*T*-1	have	been	taking	heavy	charges	*-2	to	expand	their	Third	World	loan-loss	reserves	,	are	n't	looking	for	tax-exempt	income	.
``	We	do	n't	need	the	shelter	of	tax-free	bonds	,	''	said	*T*-1	a	spokeswoman	at	Chemical	.
In	recent	weeks	,	traders	said	0	*T*-1	,	Chemical	has	sold	more	than	$	1	billion	*U*	of	tax-free	bonds	.
The	spokeswoman	confirmed	that	the	bank	has	significantly	reduced	its	muni	holdings	,	but	could	n't	immediately	confirm	the	amount	.
Insurance	companies	are	rushing	*-1	to	sell	before	the	end	of	the	year	,	when	some	of	their	tax	benefits	associated	*	with	municipal	bonds	will	be	phased	out	*-2	*T*-3	.
There	is	speculation	that	property\/casualty	firms	will	sell	even	more	munis	as	they	scramble	*-1	to	raise	cash	0	*	to	pay	claims	related	*	to	Hurricane	Hugo	and	the	Northern	California	earthquake	*T*-2	.
Fundamental	factors	are	at	work	as	well	.
Muni	bond	holders	are	worried	about	the	impact	of	a	slowing	economy	on	tax	revenue	,	at	a	time	when	many	state	and	local	governments	already	face	budget	deficits	and	huge	spending	needs	.
The	recent	natural	disasters	,	and	the	need	*ICH*-2	of	many	other	cities	*	to	rebuild	crumbling	infrastructure	,	suggests	that	supply	of	new	issues	will	continue	*-1	to	rise	sharply	--	even	as	demand	tapers	off	.
``	There	is	just	so	much	*ICH*-4	going	on	that	it	*EXP*-2	's	difficult	*	to	pick	just	one	factor	that	*T*-1	's	driving	the	market	,	''	said	*T*-3	Ronald	Ian	Heller	,	vice	president	at	First	Chicago	Capital	Markets	Inc.	,	a	subsidiary	of	First	Chicago	Corp	.
Some	of	the	recent	selling	could	actually	be	considered	*-1	a	positive	sign	.
Mutual	funds	,	for	example	,	are	said	*-1	to	be	selling	existing	municipal	bonds	*-2	to	raise	cash	0	*	to	buy	new	issues	*T*-3	.
Because	municipal	bonds	yields	have	risen	at	a	time	when	interest	rates	generally	have	fallen	*T*-1	,	some	portfolio	managers	are	assuming	that	bonds	bought	*	now	will	appreciate	in	value	as	the	municipal	bond	market	rebounds	.
Ms.	Avedisian	believes	that	the	mutual	funds	are	selling	muni	bonds	that	*T*-1	have	a	negative	convexity	--	those	that	*T*-2	have	appreciated	in	price	slowly	relative	to	the	decline	in	interest	rates	.
Such	bonds	,	she	says	0	*T*-2	,	are	those	that	*T*-1	are	nearing	their	call	date	.
But	traders	said	0	the	market	's	tone	could	pick	up	this	week	if	New	York	City	's	$	787	million	*U*	bond	offering	goes	well	.
The	offering	will	include	$	729	million	*U*	of	20-year	tax-exempt	bonds	and	$	57.8	million	*U*	of	taxable	bonds	.
A	few	weeks	ago	,	New	York	sold	$	750	million	*U*	of	tax-exempts	.
New	York	City	bonds	have	been	beaten	*-1	down	for	three	straight	weeks	.
On	Friday	,	some	issues	fell	nearly	one	point	,	or	close	to	$	10	*U*	for	each	$	1,000	*U*	face	amount	.
The	sell-off	in	New	York	City	bonds	was	triggered	*-1	by	concerns	about	the	city	's	financial	health	and	political	uncertainty	in	view	of	the	impending	mayoral	election	.
The	city	's	economy	is	growing	weaker	and	expenditures	are	rising	as	tax	revenue	is	falling	.
``	The	city	has	issued	so	much	supply	*ICH*-1	recently	that	some	people	are	getting	a	little	concerned	.
They	'd	like	*-1	to	see	some	other	names	in	their	portfolios	,	''	said	*T*-2	Michael	S.	Appelbaum	,	first	vice	president	at	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	.
But	he	thinks	0	investors	may	be	overreacting	to	the	market	's	problems	.

Friday	's	Market	Activity
Treasury	bonds	fell	sharply	on	confusion	about	this	week	's	Treasury	debt	auction	and	rumors	that	a	major	Japanese	investor	was	unloading	large	amounts	of	long-term	bonds	.
The	Treasury	's	benchmark	30-year	bond	ended	at	a	price	of	102	2\/32	,	down	nearly	5\/8	point	from	Thursday	,	or	about	$	6.25	*U*	for	each	$	1,000	*U*	face	amount	.
The	issue	's	yield	rose	to	7.93	%	from	7.88	%	.
Late	Thursday	,	the	Treasury	said	0	it	needed	*-1	to	raise	$	17	billion	*U*	quickly	and	would	do	so	by	*-1	issuing	new	securities	this	week	.
Credit	market	analysts	expected	the	Treasury	to	cancel	today	's	three-month	and	six-month	sale	and	to	sell	$	17	billion	*U*	of	cash	management	bills	.
Instead	,	the	Treasury	announced	0	it	would	sell	$	2	billion	*U*	of	51-day	cash	management	bills	today	and	said	that	the	weekly	sale	of	$	15.6	billion	*U*	of	three-month	and	six-month	bills	will	take	place	today	,	as	usual	,	but	the	sale	will	settle	tomorrow	instead	of	Thursday	.
By	*-3	moving	the	settlement	date	ahead	,	the	Treasury	can	raise	money	under	the	$	2.87	trillion	*U*	debt	ceiling	that	*T*-1	is	in	effect	through	tomorrow	,	after	which	it	reverts	to	$	2.8	trillion	*U*	*T*-2	.
The	market	also	was	hurt	*-1	by	rumors	that	Nippon	Kangyo	Kakumaru	,	a	Japanese	brokerage	firm	,	was	unloading	some	of	the	30-year	bonds	0	it	recently	purchased	*T*-2	.
One	dealer	said	0	the	talk	was	that	the	firm	sold	about	$	500	million	*U*	of	bellwether	30-year	bonds	.
The	firm	is	thought	*-3	to	have	purchased	up	to	$	3	billion	*U*	of	30-year	bonds	in	a	buying	spree	on	Wednesday	and	the	previous	Thursday	.
Dealers	say	0	the	firm	apparently	has	wanted	*-4	to	publicize	its	recent	buying	and	subsequent	selling	of	30-year	bonds	by	*-2	using	Cantor	Fitzgerald	Securities	Corp.	as	a	broker	.
Cantor	provides	price	quotes	to	Telerate	Systems	Inc.	,	a	widely	used	electronic	system	.
Nippon	Kangyo	's	moves	puzzled	traders	and	created	confusion	among	potential	investors	,	many	of	whom	*T*-5	decided	*-6	to	stay	out	of	the	market	.
As	a	result	of	its	large-scale	buying	,	some	analysts	now	say	that	liquidity	,	or	the	ability	*	to	easily	buy	and	sell	,	has	been	constrained	*-1	in	the	benchmark	Treasury	bond	issue	.
In	other	markets	:

The	sale	price	,	which	*T*-1	was	above	Wall	Street	expectations	,	sent	many	RJR	securities	up	by	one	point	.
``	It	shows	that	there	are	buyers	of	high-quality	assets	at	high	prices	in	today	's	market	,	''	said	*T*-7	Robert	Long	,	managing	director	and	head	of	the	high-yield	research	department	at	First	Boston	Corp	.
Many	of	the	RJR	securities	,	which	*T*-1	had	been	trading	near	their	52-week	lows	earlier	in	the	session	,	bounced	back	after	the	company	's	announcement	that	it	agreed	*-8	to	sell	its	Baby	Ruth	,	Butterfinger	and	Pearson	candy	businesses	to	Nestle	Foods	,	a	unit	of	the	Swiss-based	food	concern	.
The	sale	,	expected	*	to	close	before	the	end	of	the	year	,	also	includes	a	manufacturing	plant	in	Franklin	Park	,	Ill	.
RJR	's	subordinated	discount	debentures	of	2001	,	which	*T*-1	traded	as	low	as	45	Friday	,	finished	the	day	at	46	7\/8	.
Other	RJR	securities	also	closed	higher	.

A	spokesman	for	Campeau	called	the	rumors	``	ridiculous	.	''
Most	investment-grade	bonds	fell	3\/8	to	1\/2	point	.

-LRB-	During	its	centennial	year	,	The	Wall	Street	Journal	will	report	events	of	the	past	century	that	*T*-1	stand	as	milestones	of	American	business	history	.	-RRB-
Thomas	Jefferson	sold	Congress	on	the	idea	of	the	decimal	system	for	currency	,	thus	*-1	saving	Americans	the	headaches	of	pounds	,	shillings	and	pence	.
But	he	struck	out	with	the	decimal	system	of	metric	weights	and	measures	0	the	French	had	invented	*T*-1	.
Instead	,	Congress	opted	for	the	inches	,	feet	and	yards	0	the	colonists	had	brought	*T*-1	with	them	.
Americans	did	n't	dislike	metrics	;	they	simply	ignored	them	.
Scientists	felt	differently	.
In	1807	,	the	Swiss	mathematician	who	*T*-1	headed	the	U.S.	Coast	and	Geodetic	Survey	made	an	``	iron	meter	''	that	he	had	brought	*T*-2	from	Europe	the	standard	of	measure	.
By	the	end	of	the	century	scientists	had	embraced	the	system	.
Businessmen	took	their	cue	from	the	engineers	.
When	Congress	finally	passed	the	Metric	Conversion	Act	in	1975	*T*-1	,	industry	was	far	ahead	.
Because	the	law	made	compliance	voluntary	,	it	inspired	little	more	than	jokes	.
-LRB-	The	press	had	a	field	day	with	questions	about	what	*T*-1	would	happen	to	``	six-footer	,	''	``	yardstick	''	and	``	inchworm	.	''	-RRB-
Today	,	though	the	public	is	barely	aware	,	much	of	U.S.	industry	,	particularly	companies	manufacturing	or	selling	overseas	,	have	made	metrics	routine	.
General	Motors	,	for	example	,	uses	metric	terms	for	its	automobile	bodies	and	power	trains	.

Whittle	Communications	L.P.	,	which	for	months	*T*-1	has	fought	a	public	relations	battle	with	education	leaders	,	said	0	it	has	signed	500	schools	in	24	states	to	subscribe	to	the	controversial	Channel	One	news	program	and	its	sister	programs	.
Channel	One	,	a	satellite-delivered	daily	program	supported	*	by	advertising	,	is	scheduled	*	to	be	launched	*-1	next	March	.
Whittle	said	0	its	field	staff	signed	up	the	500	schools	in	238	school	districts	after	only	eight	weeks	and	company	executives	now	expect	*-1	to	reach	their	start-up	goal	of	1,000	schools	before	the	end	of	this	year	.
Christopher	Whittle	,	chairman	of	the	Knoxville	,	Tenn.	,	media	company	that	*T*-1	is	50	%	owned	by	Time	Warner	Inc.	,	said	that	by	December	1990	he	expects	*-3	to	have	Channel	One	installed	*-4	in	about	8,000	schools	with	a	potential	audience	of	six	million	.
Installation	of	the	TV	system	,	which	*T*-1	includes	*-2	providing	free	19-inch	TV	sets	in	classrooms	,	begins	in	January	.
``	What	we	've	done	*T*-2	in	eight	weeks	shows	0	we	wo	n't	have	enormous	difficulties	*	getting	to	the	place	0	we	want	*-4	to	be	*T*-3	,	''	said	*T*-1	Mr.	Whittle	.
He	said	0	his	sales	force	is	signing	up	schools	at	the	rate	of	25	a	day	.
In	California	and	New	York	,	state	officials	have	opposed	Channel	One	.
Mr.	Whittle	said	0	private	and	parochial	schools	in	both	states	will	be	canvassed	*-1	*	to	see	if	they	are	interested	in	*-2	getting	the	programs	.
Subscribing	schools	get	the	12-minute	daily	Channel	One	news	program	,	whose	four	30-second	TV	ads	during	each	show	*T*-1	have	drawn	protests	from	educators	.
Subscribers	also	get	the	Classroom	Channel	,	which	*T*-1	will	feature	ad-free	educational	programming	similar	to	some	public-TV	shows	,	and	the	Educator	's	Channel	,	which	*T*-2	will	offer	instructional	programming	for	teachers	and	school	administrators	and	will	be	supported	*-3	by	advertising	.
Whittle	has	met	some	resistance	.
The	Educational	Network	,	as	Mr.	Whittle	has	named	the	three	programs	,	has	been	offered	*-1	to	1,290	school	districts	and	Whittle	continues	*-2	to	negotiate	with	919	districts	.
About	10	%	of	the	school	districts	approached	*	have	rejected	the	network	.
Mr.	Whittle	said	that	so	far	,	three	of	the	six	schools	that	*T*-1	carried	the	program	in	a	five-week	test	last	spring	have	subscribed	to	the	program	.
One	of	the	test	schools	,	Withrow	High	School	in	Cincinnati	,	rejected	the	project	.
John	Bruner	,	associate	director	of	communications	for	Cincinnati	Public	Schools	,	said	0	Channel	One	was	rejected	*-1	because	students	watching	the	program	did	n't	fare	particularly	better	*ICH*-3	on	a	28-question	current	events	quiz	than	a	control	school	without	the	program	and	school	absences	were	almost	unchanged	during	the	period	when	the	program	was	being	aired	*-2	*T*-4	.
``	The	number	of	correct	responses	was	45	%	on	the	test	and	school	absences	did	n't	change	much	,	''	said	*T*-1	Mr.	Bruner	.
``	The	pilot	program	was	received	*-1	well	-LRB-	by	teachers	and	students	-RRB-	,	but	there	was	n't	reason	enough	*	to	sign	up	.
We	even	invited	the	public	*-1	to	stop	by	and	see	the	program	,	but	there	was	n't	much	interest	.	''

Twice	in	two	weeks	the	unraveling	of	the	on-again	,	off-again	UAL	buy-out	slammed	the	stock	market	.
Now	,	stock	prices	seem	*-1	to	be	in	a	general	retreat	.
Since	*-1	peaking	at	2791.41	on	Oct.	9	,	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	has	lost	194.69	points	,	or	7	%	,	*-1	closing	Friday	at	2596.72	,	down	17.01	.
The	number	of	issues	falling	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	each	day	is	eclipsing	the	number	of	gainers	.
And	the	number	of	stocks	hitting	new	lows	far	outstrips	the	number	setting	new	highs	.
But	why	should	an	iffy	$	6.79	billion	*U*	leveraged	buy-out	deal	shake	the	foundations	of	the	entire	stock	market	*T*-1	?
Opinions	*ICH*-3	vary	about	how	important	*PPA*-2	the	UAL	deal	was	*T*-1	to	the	market	's	health	,	but	analysts	generally	agree	that	the	market	gyrations	created	*	as	the	UAL	plan	crumbled	revealed	a	fundamental	change	in	investor	psychology	.
``	If	this	had	happened	a	few	months	ago	when	the	atmosphere	was	still	very	positive	*T*-3	it	would	n't	have	been	greeted	*-1	with	anything	like	the	impact	0	it	has	had	*T*-2	over	the	past	two	weeks	,	''	says	*T*-4	Dennis	Jarrett	,	a	market	strategist	at	Kidder	Peabody	.
There	are	,	of	course	,	analysts	who	*T*-1	view	the	near-panic	that	*T*-2	briefly	swept	through	investors	on	Oct.	13	and	again	on	Oct.	24	as	momentary	lapses	of	good	judgment	that	*T*-3	have	only	temporarily	undermined	a	healthy	stock	market	.
Sure	,	price	action	is	volatile	and	that	's	scary	,	but	all-in-all	stocks	are	still	a	good	place	0	*	to	be	*T*-3	,	they	suggest	0	*T*-2	.
The	reaction	to	the	UAL	debacle	``	is	mindless	,	''	says	0	*T*-1	John	Connolly	,	chief	market	strategist	at	Dean	Witter	.
``	UAL	is	a	small	deal	as	far	as	the	overall	market	is	concerned	*-1	.
The	only	way	0	you	can	make	it	a	big	deal	*T*-2	is	*	to	draw	linkages	that	*T*-1	just	do	n't	make	sense	.	''
He	suggests	,	for	example	,	that	investors	may	have	assumed	that	just	because	UAL	could	n't	get	financing	,	no	leveraged	buy-outs	can	get	financing	.
*-4	Carried	*-2	even	further	,	some	investors	assumed	that	since	leveraged	buy-outs	are	the	only	thing	propping	up	stock	prices	,	the	market	would	collapse	if	no	more	LBOs	could	be	done	*-1	.
``	There	will	still	be	deals	,	''	argues	*T*-1	Mr.	Connolly	.
``	There	may	not	be	as	many	and	the	buyers	may	not	get	away	with	some	of	the	things	0	they	've	done	*T*-1	in	the	past	,	but	deals	wo	n't	disappear	.	''
He	forecasts	that	the	emphasis	in	mergers	and	acquisitions	may	soon	return	to	what	he	calls	*T*-1	``	strategic	deals	,	in	which	somebody	is	taking	over	a	company	not	*-2	to	milk	the	cash	flow	,	but	because	it	's	a	good	fit	*T*-3	.	''
And	even	without	deals	,	Mr.	Connolly	figures	0	the	market	would	remain	healthy	.
He	notes	,	for	instance	,	that	there	has	n't	been	a	merger	or	acquisition	among	the	30	stocks	in	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	since	1986	,	yet	that	average	only	three	weeks	ago	hit	a	record	high	.
``	Those	stocks	are	up	because	their	earnings	are	up	and	their	dividends	are	up	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
Even	the	volatility	created	*	by	stock	index	arbitrage	and	other	computer-driven	trading	strategies	is	n't	entirely	bad	,	in	Mr.	Connolly	's	view	.
For	the	long-term	investor	who	*T*-1	picks	stocks	carefully	,	the	price	volatility	can	provide	welcome	buying	opportunities	as	short-term	players	scramble	frantically	*-2	to	sell	stocks	in	a	matter	of	minutes	.
``	Who	*ICH*-1	can	*T*-2	make	the	better	decision	,	the	guy	who	*T*-3	has	10	seconds	0	*	to	decide	what	*	to	do	*T*-4	*T*-5	or	the	guy	with	all	the	time	in	the	world	?	''	he	says	*T*-6	.
``	What	on	earth	does	the	UAL	deal	have	*-2	to	do	*T*-1	with	the	price	of	Walmart	,	which	I	was	able	*-3	to	buy	*T*-4	on	Oct.	16	at	a	very	attractive	price	?	''
Kidder	Peabody	's	Mr.	Jarrett	also	sees	some	benefits	to	the	stock	market	's	recent	drop	.
``	We	've	run	into	a	market	that	*T*-1	was	beginning	*-2	to	run	out	of	steam	and	get	frothy	,	''	he	says	*T*-3	.
``	The	balloon	had	been	blown	*-2	up	*-2	so	big	that	when	somebody	came	along	with	a	pin	*T*-3	--	in	this	case	the	UAL	deal	--	we	got	a	little	pop	.	''
The	pop	sobered	up	investors	who	*T*-1	had	been	getting	a	little	too	ebullient	,	says	0	*T*-2	Mr.	Jarrett	.
``	It	provided	an	excuse	0	for	people	to	get	back	to	reality	and	to	look	at	the	economic	data	,	especially	the	third-quarter	economic	numbers	,	and	to	realize	that	we	ca	n't	continue	*-1	to	gloss	over	what	*T*-2	is	going	on	in	the	junk	bond	market	*T*-3	.	''
But	he	figures	that	at	current	levels	the	stock	market	is	comfortably	valued	*-1	,	even	with	the	economy	obviously	slowing	.
``	Just	because	we	've	got	some	realism	back	in	the	market	does	n't	mean	0	it	's	going	lower	from	here	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	The	bottom	line	is	that	it	*EXP*-1	's	healthy	*	to	have	this	kind	of	sideways	activity	,	especially	after	a	30	%	gain	in	stock	values	over	the	past	12	months	.	''
He	's	now	estimating	that	after	a	period	of	consolidation	,	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	will	once	again	forge	new	highs	.
Maybe	,	maybe	not	.
Abby	Joseph	Cohen	,	a	market	strategist	at	Drexel	Burnham	Lambert	,	is	n't	nearly	so	sanguine	about	the	market	's	chances	of	*	surging	to	new	highs	anytime	soon	.
Her	view	is	that	stock	prices	have	three	major	props	:	merger	and	buy-out	proposals	,	earnings	and	the	economic	outlook	.
At	current	levels	of	economic	activity	and	earnings	,	stocks	are	fairly	valued	*-1	,	she	says	0	*T*-2	.
But	any	chance	for	prices	to	surge	above	fair	value	lies	in	the	speculation	that	*T*-1	accompanies	a	vigorous	merger	and	buy-out	business	,	and	UAL	has	obviously	put	a	damper	on	that	.
``	Stocks	are	n't	cheap	anymore	,	there	have	been	some	judicial	and	legislative	changes	in	the	merger	area	and	all	of	this	changes	the	arithmetic	of	deals	,	''	she	says	*T*-1	.
``	I	'm	not	saying	0	they	've	stopped	altogether	,	but	future	deals	are	going	*-2	to	be	structured	*-1	differently	and	bids	probably	wo	n't	be	as	high	.	''
But	that	's	not	the	only	problem	for	stocks	.
The	other	two	props	--	earnings	and	the	economic	outlook	--	are	troubling	,	too	.
``	M&A	is	getting	all	the	headlines	right	now	,	but	these	other	things	have	been	building	up	more	gradually	,	''	she	says	*T*-1	.
Third-quarter	earnings	have	been	generally	disappointing	and	with	economic	data	showing	a	clear	slowing	,	the	outlook	for	earnings	in	the	fourth	quarter	and	all	of	1990	is	getting	worse	.
``	There	are	a	lot	more	downward	than	upward	revisions	and	it	looks	like	people	are	questioning	corporate	profits	as	a	means	of	support	for	stock	prices	,	''	she	says	*T*-1	.
With	all	this	,	can	stock	prices	hold	their	own	?
``	The	question	is	unanswerable	at	this	point	,	''	she	says	*T*-1	.
``	It	depends	on	what	*T*-1	happens	.
If	the	economy	slips	into	a	recession	,	then	this	is	n't	a	level	that	*T*-1	's	going	*-2	to	hold	.	''
Friday	's	Market	Activity
Stock	prices	tumbled	for	a	third	consecutive	day	as	earnings	disappointments	,	a	sluggish	economy	and	a	fragile	junk	bond	market	continued	*-1	to	weigh	on	investors	.
The	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	fell	17.01	points	to	2596.72	in	active	trading	.
Volume	on	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	totaled	170,330,000	shares	.
Declining	issues	on	the	Big	Board	were	far	ahead	of	gainers	,	1,108	to	416	.
For	the	week	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	sank	92.42	points	,	or	3.4	%	.
Oil	stocks	escaped	the	brunt	of	Friday	's	selling	and	several	*ICH*-4	were	able	*-3	to	post	gains	,	including	Chevron	,	which	*T*-2	rose	5\/8	to	66	3\/8	in	Big	Board	composite	trading	of	2.4	million	shares	.
The	stock	's	advance	reflected	ongoing	speculation	that	Pennzoil	is	accumulating	a	stake	in	the	company	,	according	to	Dow	Jones	Professional	Investor	Report	.
Both	companies	declined	*-1	to	comment	on	the	rumors	,	but	several	industry	analysts	told	the	Professional	Investor	Report	0	they	believed	0	it	*EXP*-2	was	plausible	that	Pennzoil	may	be	buying	Chevron	shares	as	a	prelude	to	*	pushing	for	a	restructuring	of	the	company	.
USX	gained	1\/2	to	33	3\/8	on	a	report	*ICH*-2	in	Business	Week	magazine	that	investor	Carl	Icahn	is	said	*-1	to	have	raised	his	stake	in	the	oil	and	steel	company	to	just	about	15	%	.
Earlier	this	month	,	Mr.	Icahn	boosted	his	USX	stake	to	13.4	%	.
Elsewhere	in	the	oil	sector	,	Exxon	rallied	7\/8	to	45	3\/4	;	Amoco	rose	1\/8	to	47	;	Texaco	was	unchanged	at	51	3\/4	,	and	Atlantic	Richfield	fell	1	5\/8	to	99	1\/2	.
Mobil	,	which	*T*-1	said	0	it	plans	*-2	to	cut	its	exploration	and	production	work	force	by	about	8	%	in	a	restructuring	,	dropped	5\/8	to	56	1\/8	.
The	precious	metals	sector	outgained	other	Dow	Jones	industry	groups	by	a	wide	margin	for	the	second	consecutive	session	.
Hecla	Mining	rose	5\/8	to	14	;	Battle	Mountain	Gold	climbed	3\/4	to	16	3\/4	;	Homestake	Mining	rose	1	1\/8	to	16	7\/8	;	Lac	Minerals	added	5\/8	to	11	;	Placer	Dome	went	up	7\/8	to	16	3\/4	,	and	ASA	Ltd.	jumped	3	5\/8	to	49	5\/8	.
Gold	mining	stocks	traded	*	on	the	American	Stock	Exchange	also	showed	strength	.
Echo	Bay	Mines	rose	5\/8	to	15	7\/8	;	Pegasus	Gold	advanced	1	1\/2	to	12	,	and	Corona	Class	A	gained	1\/2	to	7	1\/2	.
Unisys	dropped	3\/4	to	16	1\/4	after	*-1	posting	a	third-quarter	loss	of	$	4.25	*U*	a	share	,	including	restructuring	charges	,	but	other	important	technology	issues	were	mixed	.
Compaq	Computer	,	which	*T*-1	had	lost	8	5\/8	Thursday	following	a	disappointing	quarterly	report	,	gained	5\/8	to	100	5\/8	.
International	Business	Machines	dropped	7\/8	to	99	7\/8	.
Digital	Equipment	tacked	on	1	1\/8	to	89	1\/8	,	and	Hewlett-Packard	fell	3\/8	to	49	3\/8	.
Dividend-related	trading	swelled	volume	in	Merrill	Lynch	,	which	*T*-1	closed	unchanged	at	28	3\/8	as	2.7	million	shares	changed	hands	.
The	stock	has	a	3.5	%	dividend	yield	and	goes	ex-dividend	today	.
Erbamont	advanced	1	1\/8	to	36	1\/2	on	1.9	million	shares	.
Montedison	,	which	*T*-1	owns	about	72	%	of	the	company	's	common	stock	,	agreed	*-2	to	buy	the	rest	for	$	37	*U*	a	share	.
Himont	,	another	majority-owned	unit	of	Montedison	,	added	1	1\/4	to	47	1\/8	.
Milton	Roy	jumped	2	to	18	3\/8	.
Crane	said	0	it	holds	an	8.9	%	stake	in	the	company	and	may	seek	control	.
Crane	dropped	1	1\/8	to	21	1\/8	.
Comprehensive	Care	,	which	*T*-1	terminated	its	agreement	*	to	merge	with	First	Hospital	,	dropped	7\/8	to	3	7\/8	.
The	company	's	decision	was	made	*-1	after	First	Hospital	failed	*-2	to	obtain	financing	for	its	offer	.
Federal	investigators	have	identified	the	problem	in	last	July	's	crash	of	a	United	Airlines	flight	in	Iowa	:	a	structural	flaw	that	*T*-1	developed	during	the	making	of	a	titanium	engine	disk	.
For	several	months	,	officials	at	the	Federal	Aviation	Administration	and	the	National	Transportation	Safety	Board	have	suspected	that	a	metallurgical	flaw	in	the	disk	led	to	a	crack	that	*T*-1	ultimately	caused	the	tail	engine	to	break	apart	in	flight	.
The	explosion	sent	shards	of	metal	flying	,	*-1	severing	the	DC-10	's	hydraulic	or	control	systems	,	and	led	to	the	crash	that	*T*-11	killed	112	people	.
But	investigators	could	confirm	their	theory	only	after	the	recent	retrieval	of	a	big	chunk	of	Flight	232	's	tail	engine	from	a	cornfield	near	the	Sioux	City	Airport	in	Iowa	.
The	safety	board	will	begin	four	days	of	hearings	on	the	accident	tomorrow	in	Sioux	City	.
Among	the	issues	0	the	board	will	examine	*T*-1	is	*T*-2	whether	United	Airlines	,	a	unit	of	UAL	Corp.	,	should	have	been	able	*-3	to	detect	the	cracks	through	maintenance	checks	.
The	engine	involved	*	was	a	CF6-6	made	*	by	General	Electric	Co	.
Anthony	Broderick	,	the	FAA	's	acting	executive	director	for	regulatory	standards	and	compliance	,	said	that	recent	tests	of	the	failed	engine	disk	indicate	that	a	flaw	--	known	*	as	``	hard	alpha	''	--	occurred	in	the	titanium	during	its	production	almost	20	years	ago	.
He	said	0	there	was	n't	any	way	0	*	to	detect	the	flaw	at	that	time	*T*-1	,	and	that	the	process	has	since	been	changed	*-2	*	to	decrease	the	chance	that	such	flaws	would	occur	.
The	FAA	already	has	ordered	that	all	232	disks	made	*	by	the	old	process	be	removed	*-1	from	the	planes	and	subjected	*-1	to	an	ultrasonic	test	in	a	water-submersion	chamber	.
Such	tests	make	the	FAA	confident	that	a	Sioux	City-type	accident	``	wo	n't	happen	again	,	''	said	0	*T*-1	Mr.	Broderick	.
A	spokesman	for	GE	said	that	the	company	has	been	working	with	the	FAA	all	along	on	this	issue	and	``	will	comply	fully	with	the	required	inspections	.	''
But	he	also	pointed	out	that	the	recalls	will	have	no	impact	on	GE	's	engine	production	.
The	CF6-6	series	engines	are	n't	being	manufactured	*-11	any	more	;	they	are	only	being	used	*-12	in	the	DC-10	Series	10	planes	currently	in	service	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
A	frozen	mountaintop	in	Tibet	may	offer	an	important	clue	about	whether	the	Earth	is	warming	perilously	.
Researchers	at	Ohio	State	University	and	Lanzhou	Institute	of	Glaciology	and	Geocryology	in	China	have	analyzed	samples	of	glacial	ice	in	Tibet	and	say	0	temperatures	there	have	been	significantly	higher	*ICH*-1	on	average	over	the	past	half-century	than	in	any	similar	period	in	the	past	10,000	years	.
The	ice	samples	are	an	important	piece	of	evidence	supporting	theories	that	the	Earth	has	warmed	considerably	in	recent	times	,	largely	because	of	pollutants	in	the	air	,	and	will	warm	far	more	in	the	century	ahead	.
A	substantial	warming	would	melt	some	of	the	Earth	's	polar	ice	caps	,	*-1	raising	the	level	of	the	oceans	and	causing	widespread	flooding	of	heavily	populated	coastal	areas	.
``	If	you	can	use	data	*-4	to	reconstruct	what	*T*-2	happened	in	the	past	,	you	have	much	more	confidence	in	predictions	for	the	future	,	''	said	*T*-5	Lonnie	Thompson	,	a	research	scientist	at	Ohio	State	who	*T*-3	dug	for	*RNR*-1	and	analyzed	*RNR*-1	the	ice	samples	.
*-1	To	compare	temperatures	over	the	past	10,000	years	,	researchers	analyzed	the	changes	in	concentrations	of	two	forms	of	oxygen	.
These	measurements	can	indicate	temperature	changes	,	researchers	said	0	*T*-1	,	because	the	rates	of	evaporation	of	these	oxygen	atoms	differ	as	temperatures	change	.
Analysis	of	ice	from	the	Dunde	ice	cap	,	a	glacial	plateau	in	Tibet	17,000	feet	above	sea	level	,	show	that	average	temperatures	were	higher	*ICH*-1	in	1937-87	than	in	any	other	50-year	period	since	before	the	last	Ice	Age	,	Mr.	Thompson	said	0	*T*-2	.
Some	climate	models	project	that	interior	regions	of	Asia	would	be	among	the	first	0	*T*-2	to	heat	up	in	a	global	warming	because	they	are	far	from	oceans	,	which	*T*-1	moderate	temperature	changes	.
But	the	ice-core	samples	are	n't	definitive	proof	that	the	so-called	greenhouse	effect	will	lead	to	further	substantial	global	heating	,	Mr.	Thompson	acknowledged	0	*T*-1	.
According	to	greenhouse	theories	,	increased	carbon	dioxide	emissions	,	largely	caused	*	by	burning	of	fossil	fuels	,	will	cause	the	Earth	to	warm	up	because	carbon	dioxide	prevents	heat	from	*-1	escaping	into	space	.
Skeptics	say	that	if	that	's	the	case	,	temperatures	should	have	risen	fairly	uniformly	over	the	past	century	,	*	reflecting	the	increase	in	carbon	dioxide	.
Instead	,	the	Dunde	ice-core	record	shows	increasing	temperatures	from	1900	through	the	early	1950s	,	decreasing	temperatures	from	the	late	1950s	through	the	mid-1970s	,	then	higher	temperatures	again	through	last	year	.
Other	temperature	data	show	similar	unexplained	swings	.
``	Climate	varies	drastically	due	to	natural	causes	,	''	said	*T*-1	Mr.	Thompson	.
But	he	said	0	ice	samples	from	Peru	,	Greenland	and	Antarctica	all	show	substantial	signs	of	warming	.
Telxon	Corp.	said	0	its	vice	president	for	manufacturing	resigned	and	its	Houston	work	force	has	been	trimmed	*-1	by	40	people	,	or	about	15	%	.
The	maker	of	hand-held	computers	and	computer	systems	said	0	the	personnel	changes	were	needed	*-1	*	to	improve	the	efficiency	of	its	manufacturing	operation	.
The	company	said	0	it	has	n't	named	a	successor	to	Ronald	Bufton	,	the	vice	president	who	*T*-1	resigned	.
Its	Houston	work	force	now	totals	230	.
CNW	Corp.	said	0	the	final	step	in	the	acquisition	of	the	company	has	been	completed	*-1	with	the	merger	of	CNW	with	a	subsidiary	of	Chicago	&	North	Western	Holdings	Corp	.
As	*	reported	*-2	,	CNW	agreed	*-3	to	be	acquired	*-1	by	a	group	of	investors	led	*	by	Blackstone	Capital	Partners	Limited	Partnership	for	$	50	*U*	a	share	,	or	about	$	950	million	*U*	.
Congress	sent	to	President	Bush	an	$	8.5	billion	*U*	military	construction	bill	that	*T*-1	cuts	spending	for	new	installations	by	16	%	while	*-2	revamping	the	Pentagon	budget	*-3	to	move	more	than	$	450	million	*U*	from	foreign	bases	to	home-state	projects	.
The	fiscal	1990	measure	builds	on	a	pattern	set	*	earlier	this	year	by	House	and	Senate	defense	authorizing	committees	,	and	--	at	a	time	of	retrenchment	for	the	military	and	concern	about	the	U.S.	's	standing	in	the	world	economy	--	overseas	spending	is	most	vulnerable	.
Total	Pentagon	requests	for	installations	in	West	Germany	,	Japan	,	South	Korea	,	the	United	Kingdom	and	the	Philippines	,	for	example	,	are	cut	*-1	by	almost	two-thirds	,	while	lawmakers	added	to	the	military	budget	for	construction	in	all	but	a	dozen	states	at	home	.
The	result	is	that	instead	of	the	Pentagon	's	proposed	split	of	60-40	between	domestic	and	foreign	bases	,	the	reduced	funding	is	distributed	*-41	by	a	ratio	of	approximately	70-30	.
The	extra	margin	for	bases	in	the	U.S.	enhances	the	power	of	the	appropriations	committees	;	meanwhile	,	lawmakers	used	their	positions	*-2	to	garner	as	much	as	six	times	what	the	Pentagon	had	requested	*T*-1	for	their	individual	states	.
House	Appropriations	Committee	Chairman	Jamie	Whitten	-LRB-	D.	,	Miss	.	-RRB-	helped	*-1	secure	$	49.7	million	*U*	for	his	state	,	or	more	than	double	the	Pentagon	's	budget	.
West	Virginia	,	home	of	Senate	Appropriations	Committee	Chairman	Robert	Byrd	,	would	receive	$	21.5	million	*U*	--	four	times	the	military	's	request	.
Tennessee	and	North	Carolina	,	home	states	of	the	two	Democratic	chairmen	of	the	House	and	Senate	military	construction	subcommittees	,	receive	$	243.2	million	*U*	,	or	25	%	above	the	Pentagon	's	request	.
Though	spending	for	Iowa	and	Oregon	was	far	less	,	their	increases	above	Pentagon	requests	--	640	%	and	430	%	,	respectively	--	were	much	greater	because	of	the	influence	of	Republicans	at	critical	junctures	.
The	swift	passage	of	the	bill	,	which	*T*-1	cleared	the	Senate	and	House	on	simple	voice	votes	last	week	,	contrasts	with	the	problems	still	facing	a	more	cumbersome	$	66.8	billion	*U*	measure	funding	housing	,	environmental	,	space	and	veterans	programs	.
By	an	84-6	margin	,	the	Senate	approved	the	bulk	of	the	spending	Friday	,	but	the	bill	was	then	sent	back	to	the	House	*	to	resolve	the	question	of	how	*	to	address	budget	limits	on	credit	allocations	for	the	Federal	Housing	Administration	*T*-1	.
The	House	Democratic	leadership	could	seek	*-1	to	waive	these	restrictions	,	but	the	underlying	bill	is	already	under	attack	for	excesses	elsewhere	.
Appropriations	committees	have	used	an	assortment	of	devices	*-1	to	disguise	as	much	as	$	1	billion	*U*	in	spending	,	and	as	critics	have	awakened	to	these	devices	,	the	bill	can	seem	like	a	wounded	caribou	trying	*	to	make	it	past	ice	and	wolves	*-3	to	reach	safer	winter	grazing	.
Much	of	the	excess	spending	will	be	pushed	*-3	into	fiscal	1991	,	and	in	some	cases	is	temporarily	parked	*-3	in	slow-spending	accounts	in	anticipation	of	*	being	transferred	*-1	to	faster-spending	areas	after	the	budget	scorekeeping	is	completed	*-2	.
For	example	,	a	House-Senate	conference	ostensibly	increased	the	National	Aeronautics	and	Space	Administration	budget	for	construction	of	facilities	to	nearly	$	592	million	*U*	,	or	more	than	$	200	million	*U*	above	what	either	chamber	had	previously	approved	*T*-1	.
Part	of	the	increase	would	provide	$	90	million	*U*	toward	*	ensuring	construction	of	a	costly	solid	rocket-motor	facility	in	Mr.	Whitten	's	Mississippi	.
But	as	much	as	$	177	million	*U*	,	or	nearly	30	%	of	the	account	,	is	marked	*-1	for	potential	transfers	to	research	,	management	and	flight	accounts	that	*T*-2	are	spent	*-3	out	at	a	faster	clip	.
The	bill	's	managers	face	criticism	,	too	,	for	the	unusual	number	of	conditions	openly	imposed	*	on	where	funds	will	be	spent	*-1	*T*-2	.
Conservatives	,	embarrassed	*	by	Republican	influence-peddling	scandals	at	the	Department	of	Housing	and	Urban	Development	,	have	used	the	issue	in	an	effort	*	to	shift	blame	onto	a	Democratic-controlled	Congress	.
HUD	Secretary	Jack	Kemp	backed	an	unsuccessful	effort	*	to	strike	such	language	last	week	,	but	received	little	support	from	the	White	House	budget	office	,	which	*T*-1	wants	*-2	to	protect	space-station	funding	in	the	bill	and	has	tended	*-2	to	turn	its	eyes	from	pork-barrel	amendments	.
Within	discretionary	funds	for	community	development	grants	,	more	than	$	3.7	million	*U*	is	allocated	*-1	to	six	projects	in	Michigan	,	home	state	of	a	subcommittee	chairman	,	Rep.	Bob	Traxler	.
House	Speaker	Thomas	Foley	won	$	510,000	*U*	for	a	project	in	his	district	in	Washington	state	,	and	$	1.3	million	*U*	,	earmarked	*	by	Sen.	Daniel	Inouye	,	amounts	to	a	business	subsidy	under	the	title	``	Hawaiian	sugar	mills	job	retention	.	''
The	powerful	Democrat	had	first	wanted	*-2	to	add	language	relaxing	environmental	restrictions	on	two	mills	on	the	Hamakua	coast	that	*T*-1	are	threatening	*-3	to	close	.
When	this	plan	met	resistance	*T*-3	,	it	*EXP*-4	was	agreed	instead	*	to	take	money	from	HUD	*-1	to	subsidize	needed	improvements	in	two	settling	ponds	for	the	mills	,	which	*T*-2	employ	an	estimated	1,500	workers	,	according	to	Mr.	Inouye	's	office	.
Dennis	Farney	's	Oct.	13	page-one	article	``	River	of	Despair	,	''	about	the	poverty	along	the	Mississippi	,	fanned	childhood	memories	of	when	my	parents	were	sharecroppers	in	southeastern	Arkansas	,	only	a	few	miles	from	the	river	*T*-1	.
Although	we	were	white	,	the	same	economic	factors	*ICH*-1	affected	us	as	*	affects	the	black	people	0	Mr.	Farney	writes	about	*T*-2	.
Fortunately	,	an	aunt	with	a	college	degree	bought	a	small	farm	and	moved	us	50	miles	north	to	good	schools	and	an	environment	that	*T*-1	opened	the	world	of	opportunity	for	me	as	an	eight-year-old	.
Though	I	've	been	blessed	*-1	with	academic	degrees	and	some	success	in	the	materialistic	world	,	I	've	never	forgotten	*RNR*-2	or	lost	contact	with	*RNR*-2	those	memories	of	the	1930s	.
Most	of	the	land	in	that	and	other	parts	of	the	Delta	are	now	owned	*-1	by	second	,	third	or	fourth	generations	of	the	same	families	.
These	are	the	families	who	*T*-1	used	*RNR*-3	--	and	sometime	abused	*RNR*-3	--	their	sharecroppers	,	people	who	*T*-2	had	no	encouragement	and	little	access	to	an	education	or	training	for	a	better	life	.
Following	World	War	II	,	when	one	family	with	mechanized	equipment	could	farm	crops	formerly	requiring	20	families	*T*-2	,	the	surplus	people	were	dumped	*-1	into	the	mainstream	of	society	with	no	Social	Security	,	no	skills	in	the	workplace	,	no	hope	for	their	future	except	welfare	.
And	today	,	many	of	their	children	,	grandchildren	and	great-grandchildren	remain	on	welfare	.
In	the	meantime	,	the	landowners	continue	receiving	generous	subsidies	that	*T*-1	began	during	New	Deal	days	.
Or	those	who	*T*-1	choose	not	*-2	to	farm	can	lease	their	lands	and	crop	allotments	for	handsome	sums	.
Farmers	in	the	Midwest	and	other	areas	have	suffered	,	but	those	along	the	Mississippi	continue	*-3	to	prosper	with	holdings	that	*T*-2	were	built	*-1	with	the	sweat	of	men	and	women	living	in	economic	slavery	.
And	when	they	were	no	longer	needed	*-4	*T*-2	,	they	were	turned	*-1	loose	*-1	unprepared	*-3	to	build	lives	of	their	own	.

Because	the	cycle	of	poverty	along	the	lower	Mississippi	goes	back	so	many	generations	,	*	breaking	this	cycle	will	be	next	to	impossible	.
Sadly	,	the	cycle	appears	not	as	waves	but	as	a	downward	spiral	.
Yet	the	evidence	that	we	have	not	hit	bottom	is	found	*-1	in	the	fact	that	we	are	not	yet	helping	ourselves	.
The	people	of	the	Delta	are	waiting	for	that	big	factory	0	*T*-1	to	open	,	river	traffic	0	*T*-2	to	increase	,	government	spending	0	*T*-3	to	fund	job-training	programs	or	public	schools	0	*T*-4	to	educate	apathetic	students	.
Because	we	refuse	*-1	to	face	the	tough	answers	,	the	questions	continue	as	fodder	for	the	commissions	and	committees	,	for	the	media	and	politicians	.
Coffee-shop	chatter	does	not	lend	itself	to	*	solving	the	problems	of	racism	,	teen	pregnancy	or	lack	of	parental	support	or	guidance	.
Does	the	Delta	deserve	government	help	in	*-2	attracting	industry	when	the	majority	of	residents	,	black	and	white	,	do	not	realize	0	racism	alienates	potential	employers	*T*-1	?
Should	we	focus	on	the	region	's	infant-mortality	rate	when	the	vocal	right-wingers	and	the	school	boards	,	mayors	and	legislators	prohibit	schools	from	*-1	teaching	the	two	ways	-LRB-	abstinence	or	contraceptives	-RRB-	of	*	decreasing	teen	pregnancy	?
Delta	problems	are	difficult	,	not	impossible	,	0	*	to	solve	*T*-1	--	I	am	just	not	convinced	*-2	that	we	are	ready	*-3	to	solve	them	yet	.

Eugene	S.	Clarke	IV
Hollandale	,	Miss	.
Your	story	is	an	insult	to	the	citizens	of	the	Mississippi	Delta	.
Many	of	the	problems	0	you	presented	*T*-1	exist	in	every	part	of	this	country	.
Poverty	is	only	two	blocks	from	President	Bush	's	residence	.
For	years	,	we	tried	*-1	to	ignore	the	problem	of	poverty	,	and	now	that	it	has	gotten	out	of	hand	it	's	a	new	crusade	for	the	media	and	our	Democratic	Congress	.
Nobody	should	have	*-1	to	live	in	such	poor	conditions	as	in	``	Sugar	Ditch	,	''	but	when	you	travel	to	Washington	,	Boston	,	Chicago	or	New	York	*T*-2	,	the	same	problems	exist	.
The	only	difference	is	,	0	in	those	cities	the	poor	are	housed	*-1	in	high-rise-project	apartments	each	consisting	of	one	room	,	with	rusty	pipes	called	*	plumbing	,	rodents	and	cockroaches	everywhere	and	nonworking	elevators	--	and	with	the	building	patrolled	*	by	gangs	and	drug	dealers	.
Many	middle-class	people	would	love	free	food	,	Medicaid	insurance	,	utilities	and	rent	.
Then	maybe	I	could	stay	home	and	have	seven	children	and	watch	Oprah	Winfrey	,	like	Beulah	in	the	article	,	instead	of	*-2	having	one	child	and	working	constantly	*-1	just	to	stay	above	water	,	like	so	many	families	in	this	country	.
Dee	Ann	Wilson
Greenville	,	Miss	.
Mobil	Corp.	is	in	the	midst	of	*	cutting	back	its	exploration	and	production	group	,	which	*T*-1	finds	and	develops	oil	and	gas	reserves	in	the	U.S.	,	by	as	much	as	15	%	as	part	of	a	new	restructuring	of	that	sector	of	its	business	.
Management	advised	employees	Friday	that	it	was	going	*-1	to	reduce	employment	in	production	operations	of	the	group	by	8	%	,	or	400	people	.
The	exploration	side	of	the	unit	has	recently	undergone	a	similar	overhaul	,	during	which	it	also	lost	as	many	as	400	employees	*T*-1	,	a	company	spokesman	said	0	*T*-2	in	response	to	questions	.
Mobil	Exploration	&	Producing	U.S.	Inc.	,	the	group	involved	*	,	currently	has	a	work	force	of	somewhat	less	than	5,000	.
A	few	years	ago	,	Mobil	restructured	the	entire	company	during	an	industrywide	shakeout	.
But	since	then	U.S.	oil	production	has	declined	and	Mobil	wants	*-1	to	focus	its	oil-finding	efforts	overseas	.
Mobil	alluded	to	the	work-force	cuts	last	week	when	it	took	a	$	40	million	*U*	charge	as	part	of	its	third-quarter	earnings	and	attributed	it	to	a	restructuring	.
Mobil	officials	said	that	it	is	unlikely	0	any	additional	charges	related	*	to	this	move	will	be	taken	*-1	in	future	quarters	.
On	Wednesday	,	Mobil	will	begin	*-1	offering	separation	packages	and	voluntary	retirement	in	its	U.S.	production	operation	.
Mobil	officials	said	0	they	have	been	studying	ways	of	*	streamlining	these	operations	since	early	this	year	.
During	the	coming	months	,	layers	of	management	will	be	peeled	*-1	away	and	regional	offices	will	become	more	autonomous	.
For	greater	efficiency	,	employees	at	those	locations	will	be	reorganized	*-1	into	teams	responsible	for	*	managing	the	properties	under	their	jurisdiction	,	Mobil	said	0	*T*-2	.
``	The	main	feature	of	the	new	organization	is	that	each	local	manager	will	have	both	the	authority	and	accountability	for	profitable	and	technically	sound	operations	,	''	said	*T*-1	Charles	E.	Spruell	,	president	of	the	Mobil	unit	.
Field	offices	at	New	Orleans	;	Houston	;	Denver	;	Midland	,	Tex.	;	Bakersfield	,	Calif.	;	Oklahoma	City	;	and	Liberal	,	Kan.	,	will	be	maintained	*-1	.
But	the	staffs	at	some	of	those	locations	will	be	slashed	*-1	while	at	others	the	work	force	will	be	increased	*-2	.
For	instance	,	employment	in	Denver	will	be	reduced	*-1	to	105	from	430	.
But	on	the	West	Coast	,	where	profitable	oil	production	is	more	likely	than	in	the	midcontinent	region	*T*-1	,	the	Bakersfield	,	Calif.	,	office	staff	of	130	will	grow	by	175	to	305	.
The	reorganization	will	``	focus	on	the	value	and	potential	of	assets	,	''	Mr.	Spruell	said	0	*T*-1	.
*	Wanted	*-2	:	An	investment	that	*T*-1	's	as	simple	and	secure	as	a	certificate	of	deposit	but	offers	a	return	worth	*	getting	excited	about	*?*	.
With	$	150	billion	*U*	of	CDs	maturing	this	month	,	a	lot	of	people	have	been	scouring	the	financial	landscape	for	just	such	an	investment	.
In	April	,	when	many	of	them	bought	their	CDs	*T*-1	,	six-month	certificates	were	yielding	more	than	9	%	;	investors	willing	*	to	look	could	find	double-digit	yields	at	some	banks	and	thrifts	.
Now	,	the	nationwide	average	yield	on	a	six-month	CD	is	just	under	8	%	,	and	8.5	%	is	about	the	best	around	.
But	investors	looking	for	alternatives	are	n't	finding	it	easy	.
Yields	on	most	fixed-income	securities	are	lower	than	several	months	ago	.
And	the	stock	market	's	recent	gyrations	are	a	painful	reminder	of	the	dangers	there	.
``	If	you	're	looking	for	a	significantly	higher	yield	with	the	same	level	of	risk	as	a	CD	,	you	're	not	going	*-2	to	find	it	,	''	says	*T*-1	Washington	financial	planner	Dennis	M.	Gurtz	.
There	are	,	however	,	some	alternatives	that	income-oriented	investors	should	consider	*T*-1	,	investment	advisers	say	0	*T*-2	.
Short-term	municipal	bonds	,	bond	funds	and	tax-deferred	annuities	are	some	of	the	choices	0	they	mention	*T*-1	--	and	not	just	as	a	way	0	*	to	get	a	higher	return	*T*-2	.
In	particular	,	advisers	say	0	*T*-2	,	investors	may	want	*-3	to	look	at	securities	that	*T*-1	reduce	the	risk	that	CD	holders	are	confronting	*T*-5	right	now	,	of	*	having	*-4	to	reinvest	the	proceeds	of	maturing	short-term	certificates	at	lower	rates	.
A	mix	of	CDs	and	other	holdings	may	make	the	most	sense	.
``	People	should	remember	0	their	money	is	n't	all	or	nothing	--	they	do	n't	need	*-1	to	be	shopping	for	the	one	interest-rate-type	investment	and	putting	all	their	money	in	it	,	''	says	*T*-2	Bethesda	,	Md.	,	adviser	Karen	Schaeffer	.
Here	's	*T*-1	a	look	at	some	of	the	alternatives	:
SHORT-TERM	MUNICIPALS	:
Investors	with	a	heavy	tax	load	should	take	out	their	calculators	.
Yields	on	municipal	bonds	can	be	higher	than	after-tax	yields	on	CDs	for	maturities	of	perhaps	one	to	five	years	.
That	's	because	municipal-bond	interest	is	exempt	from	federal	income	tax	--	and	from	state	and	local	taxes	too	,	for	in-state	investors	.
For	an	investor	paying	tax	at	a	33	%	rate	,	a	seemingly	puny	6	%	yield	on	a	one-year	muni	is	equivalent	to	a	taxable	9	%	.
Rates	*ICH*-1	approach	6.5	%	on	five-year	municipals	.
Some	of	the	more	cautious	CD	holders	might	like	``	pre-refunded	''	municipals	.
These	securities	get	top	credit	ratings	because	the	issuers	have	put	aside	U.S.	bonds	that	*T*-2	will	be	sold	*-4	*	to	pay	off	holders	when	the	municipals	are	retired	*-1	*T*-3	.
``	It	's	a	no-brainer	:	You	do	n't	have	*-2	to	worry	about	diversification	;	you	do	n't	have	*-3	to	worry	about	quality	,	''	says	*T*-1	Steven	J.	Hueglin	,	executive	vice	president	of	the	New	York	bond	firm	of	Gabriele	,	Hueglin	&	Cashman	Inc	.
*	Consider	a	``	laddered	''	bond	portfolio	,	with	issues	maturing	in	,	say	,	1992	,	1993	and	1994	,	advises	0	*T*-1	Malcolm	A.	Makin	,	a	Westerly	,	R.I.	,	financial	planner	.
The	idea	is	*	to	have	money	rolling	over	each	year	at	prevailing	interest	rates	.
BOND	FUNDS	:
Bond	mutual	funds	offer	diversification	and	are	easy	0	*	to	buy	and	sell	*T*-1	.
That	makes	them	a	reasonable	option	for	investors	who	*T*-1	will	accept	some	risk	of	price	fluctuation	in	order	*-2	to	make	a	bet	that	interest	rates	will	decline	over	the	next	year	or	so	.
Buyers	can	look	forward	to	double-digit	annual	returns	if	they	are	right	.
But	they	will	have	disappointing	returns	or	even	losses	if	interest	rates	rise	instead	.
Bond	resale	prices	,	and	thus	fund	share	prices	,	move	in	the	opposite	direction	from	rates	.
The	price	movements	get	bigger	as	the	maturity	of	the	securities	lengthens	.
*	Consider	,	for	instance	,	two	bond	funds	from	Vanguard	Group	of	Investment	Cos.	that	*T*-1	were	both	yielding	8.6	%	on	a	recent	day	.
The	Short	Term	Bond	Fund	,	with	an	average	maturity	of	2	1\/2	years	,	would	deliver	a	total	return	for	one	year	of	about	10.6	%	if	rates	drop	one	percentage	point	and	a	one-year	return	of	about	6.6	%	if	rates	rise	by	the	same	amount	.
But	,	in	the	same	circumstances	,	the	returns	would	be	a	more	extreme	14.6	%	and	2.6	%	for	the	Vanguard	Bond	Market	Fund	,	with	its	12	1\/2-year	average	maturity	.
``	You	get	equity-like	returns	''	from	bonds	if	you	guess	right	on	rates	,	says	0	*T*-1	James	E.	Wilson	,	a	Columbia	,	S.C.	,	planner	.
If	interest	rates	do	n't	change	,	bond	fund	investors	'	returns	will	be	about	equal	to	the	funds	'	current	yields	.
DEFERRED	ANNUITIES	:
These	insurance	company	contracts	feature	some	of	the	same	tax	benefits	and	restrictions	as	non-deductible	individual	retirement	accounts	:	Investment	gains	are	compounded	*-1	without	tax	consequences	until	money	is	withdrawn	*-2	,	but	a	10	%	penalty	tax	is	imposed	*-3	on	withdrawals	made	*	before	age	59	1\/2	.
Aimed	*-2	specifically	at	CD	holders	are	*T*-1	so-called	CD-type	annuities	,	or	certificates	of	annuity	.
An	interest	rate	is	guaranteed	*-1	for	between	one	and	seven	years	,	after	which	holders	get	30	days	0	*	to	choose	another	guarantee	period	or	to	switch	to	another	insurer	's	contract	without	the	surrender	charges	that	*T*-2	are	common	to	annuities	*T*-3	*T*-4	.
Some	current	rates	exceed	those	on	CDs	.
For	instance	,	a	CD-type	annuity	from	North	American	Co.	for	Life	&	Health	Insurance	,	Chicago	,	offers	8.8	%	interest	for	one	year	or	a	9	%	rate	for	two	years	.
Annuities	are	rarely	a	good	idea	at	age	35	because	of	the	withdrawal	restrictions	.
But	at	age	55	,	``	they	may	be	a	great	deal	,	''	says	0	*T*-1	Mr.	Wilson	,	the	Columbia	,	S.C.	,	planner	.
MONEY	MARKET	FUNDS	:
That	's	right	,	money	market	mutual	funds	.
The	conventional	wisdom	is	*	to	go	into	money	funds	when	rates	are	rising	*T*-1	and	shift	out	at	times	such	as	the	present	,	when	rates	seem	headed	*-3	down	*T*-2	.
With	average	maturities	of	a	month	or	so	,	money	funds	offer	fixed	share	prices	and	floating	returns	that	*T*-1	track	market	interest	rates	,	with	a	slight	lag	.
Still	,	today	's	highest-yielding	money	funds	may	beat	CDs	over	the	next	year	even	if	rates	fall	,	says	0	*T*-1	Guy	Witman	,	an	editor	of	the	Bond	Market	Advisor	newsletter	in	Atlanta	.
That	's	because	top-yielding	funds	currently	offer	yields	almost	1	1\/2	percentage	points	above	the	average	CD	yield	.
Mr.	Witman	likes	the	Dreyfus	Worldwide	Dollar	Money	Market	Fund	,	with	a	seven-day	compound	yield	just	under	9.5	%	.
*-1	A	new	fund	,	its	operating	expenses	are	being	temporarily	subsidized	*-1	by	the	sponsor	.
*	Try	combining	a	money	fund	and	an	intermediate-term	bond	fund	as	a	low-risk	bet	on	falling	rates	,	suggests	0	*T*-1	Back	Bay	Advisors	Inc.	,	a	mutual	fund	unit	of	New	England	Insurance	Co	.
If	rates	unexpectedly	rise	,	the	increasing	return	on	the	money	fund	will	partly	offset	the	lower-than-expected	return	from	the	bond	fund	.
Federal	drug	regulators	,	concerned	over	British	reports	that	diabetics	have	died	after	*-1	shifting	from	animal	to	human-based	insulin	,	say	0	they	are	considering	a	study	0	*T*-2	to	see	if	similar	deaths	have	occurred	here	.
The	United	Kingdom	reports	came	from	Dr.	Patrick	Toseland	,	head	of	clinical	chemistry	at	Guy	's	Hospital	in	London	.
In	a	telephone	interview	Friday	,	Dr.	Toseland	said	0	the	number	of	sudden	,	unexplained	deaths	of	diabetics	0	he	had	seen	*T*-1	this	year	was	17	compared	with	just	two	in	1985	.
At	least	six	of	the	deaths	occurred	among	relatively	young	diabetics	who	*T*-1	had	switched	from	animal	to	human	insulin	within	the	past	year	,	he	said	0	*T*-2	.
Dr.	Solomon	Sobel	,	director	of	metabolism	and	endrocrine	drug	products	for	the	U.S.	Food	and	Drug	Administration	,	said	0	FDA	officials	have	discussed	Dr.	Toseland	's	findings	``	fairly	intensively	.	''
While	there	have	been	no	reports	of	similar	sudden	unexplained	deaths	among	diabetics	in	the	U.S.	,	Dr.	Sobel	said	0	the	FDA	plans	*-1	to	examine	Dr.	Toseland	's	evidence	and	is	considering	its	own	study	here	.
Dr.	Toseland	,	a	toxicologist	,	said	0	he	was	preparing	an	article	for	a	British	forensic	medical	journal	*-2	raising	the	possibility	that	the	deaths	may	have	occurred	after	human	insulin	blunted	critical	warning	signs	indicating	hypoglycemia	,	or	low	blood	sugar	,	which	*T*-1	can	kill	diabetics	.
The	usual	warning	signs	of	hypoglycemia	include	sweating	,	anxiety	and	cramps	.
With	proper	warning	,	diabetics	can	easily	raise	their	blood	sugar	to	safe	levels	by	*-1	eating	sugar	or	sugary	food	.
``	The	anecdotal	data	certainly	shows	that	some	of	the	people	were	not	aware	of	the	rapid	onset	of	hypoglycemia	,	''	Dr.	Toseland	said	*T*-1	.
At	the	U.S.	National	Institutes	of	Health	,	Dr.	Robert	E.	Silverman	,	chief	of	the	diabetes	program	branch	,	said	0	no	evidence	of	unexpected	deaths	from	hypoglycemia	had	shown	up	in	a	study	of	1,500	diabetics	that	*T*-1	has	been	under	way	at	NIH	for	five	years	.
However	,	he	said	0	officials	conducting	the	study	had	n't	been	looking	for	signs	of	problems	related	to	hypoglycemia	unawareness	.
``	We	are	now	monitoring	for	it	much	more	closely	,	''	he	said	*T*-1	.
``	We	do	know	0	there	are	slight	differences	in	the	way	0	human	and	animal	insulins	drive	down	blood	sugar	*T*-2	,	''	Dr.	Sobel	said	*T*-1	.
The	human-based	drug	starts	the	blood	sugar	dropping	sooner	and	drives	it	down	faster	,	he	said	0	*T*-1	.
``	But	we	do	n't	believe	0	there	is	enough	of	a	difference	*	to	be	clinically	significant	,	''	Dr.	Sobel	said	*T*-1	.
Reports	of	Dr.	Toseland	's	findings	in	the	British	press	have	triggered	widespread	concern	among	diabetics	there	.
Both	the	British	Diabetic	Association	and	the	Committee	on	Safety	in	Medicines	--	Britain	's	equivalent	of	the	U.S.	FDA	--	recently	issued	statements	noting	the	lack	of	hard	scientific	evidence	0	*T*-1	to	support	Dr.	Toseland	's	findings	.
On	Friday	,	the	American	Diabetes	Association	issued	a	similar	statement	urging	the	six	million	U.S.	diabetics	*-1	not	to	overreact	to	the	British	report	.
``	A	loss	of	the	warning	symptoms	of	hypoglycemia	is	a	complex	problem	that	*T*-1	is	very	unlikely	*-3	to	be	due	simply	to	the	type	of	insulin	used	*	,	''	the	American	association	said	*T*-2	.
The	FDA	already	requires	drug	manufacturers	to	include	warnings	*ICH*-1	with	insulin	products	that	symptoms	of	hypoglycemia	are	less	pronounced	with	human	insulin	than	with	animal-based	products	.
Eli	Lilly	&	Co.	,	the	Indianapolis-based	drug	manufacturer	,	dominates	the	U.S.	human	insulin	market	with	its	product	known	*	as	Humulin	.
Lilly	is	building	plants	0	*	to	make	the	insulin	*T*-1	in	Indianapolis	and	Fagershein	,	France	.
In	its	latest	annual	report	,	Lilly	said	0	Humulin	sales	have	shown	``	excellent	growth	.	''
Lilly	officials	said	0	they	had	seen	reports	of	hypoglycemic	unawareness	among	some	patients	making	the	shift	from	animal	to	human	insulin	,	but	did	n't	know	if	the	problem	had	caused	any	deaths	.
Dr.	Leigh	Thompson	,	a	Lilly	group	vice	president	,	said	0	the	company	's	clinical	trials	of	both	its	animal	and	human-based	insulins	indicated	no	difference	in	the	level	of	hypoglycemia	between	users	of	either	product	.
Dr.	Toseland	said	0	most	of	the	British	diabetics	who	*T*-1	died	had	been	taking	a	human-based	insulin	made	*	by	Novo\/Nordisk	,	a	Danish	manufacturer	.
None	of	the	diabetics	were	using	Lilly	's	insulin	.
SharesBase	Corp.	said	0	it	will	reduce	its	221-person	work	force	by	about	25	%	,	effective	tomorrow	,	in	an	effort	*	to	stem	continuing	losses	.
The	company	,	which	*T*-1	makes	data	base	systems	and	software	,	said	0	it	expects	*-2	to	report	a	loss	for	the	third	quarter	ended	Sept.	30	.
Defense	intellectuals	have	complained	for	years	that	the	Pentagon	can	not	determine	priorities	because	it	has	no	strategy	.
Last	April	,	the	new	defense	secretary	,	Richard	Cheney	,	acknowledged	that	,	``	given	an	ideal	world	,	we	'd	have	a	nice	,	neat	,	orderly	process	.
We	'd	do	the	strategy	and	then	we	'd	come	around	and	do	the	budget	.
This	city	does	n't	work	that	way	.	''
With	a	five-year	defense	plan	costing	more	than	$	1.6	trillion	*U*	,	it	's	about	time	0	we	put	together	a	defense	strategy	that	*T*-1	works	in	Washington	*T*-2	.
This	wo	n't	happen	until	strategists	come	down	from	their	ivory	tower	and	learn	*-1	to	work	in	the	real	world	of	limited	budgets	and	uncertain	futures	.
As	it	is	*?*	,	we	identify	national	goals	and	the	threats	to	these	goals	,	we	shape	a	strategy	0	*	to	counter	these	threats	*T*-1	,	we	determine	the	forces	needed	*	*-3	to	execute	the	strategy	,	before	finally	*-2	forging	the	budgets	needed	*	*	to	build	and	maintain	the	forces	.
These	procedures	consume	millions	of	man-hours	of	labor	and	produce	tons	of	paper	,	and	each	year	,	their	end	product	--	the	Five	Year	Defense	Plan	--	promptly	melts	away	.
The	graph	on	the	left	shows	how	this	happens	*T*-1	-LRB-	*	see	accompanying	illustration	--	WSJ	Oct.	30	,	1989	-RRB-	.
*	Compare	the	past	eight	five-year	plans	with	actual	appropriations	.
The	Pentagon	's	strategists	produce	budgets	that	*T*-2	simply	can	not	be	executed	*-1	because	they	assume	0	a	defense	strategy	depends	only	on	goals	and	threats	.
Strategy	,	however	,	is	about	possibilities	,	not	hopes	and	dreams	.
By	*-1	ignoring	costs	,	U.S.	strategists	abdicate	their	responsibility	for	hard	decisions	.
That	puts	the	real	strategic	decisions	in	the	hands	of	others	:	bean	counters	,	budgeteers	,	and	pork-barrelers	.
These	people	have	different	agendas	.
And	as	a	result	--	as	the	recent	vote	*ICH*-1	by	the	House	*	to	undo	Mr.	Cheney	's	program	terminations	suggests	0	*?*	--	the	preservation	of	jobs	is	becoming	the	real	goal	of	defense	``	strategy	.	''
How	can	we	turn	this	situation	around	*T*-1	?
Reform	starts	in	the	Pentagon	.
Strategists	should	consider	the	impact	of	budget	uncertainties	at	the	beginning	of	the	planning	process	.
They	ought	*-2	to	examine	how	a	range	of	optimistic	to	pessimistic	budget	scenarios	would	change	the	defense	program	*T*-1	.
They	would	then	develop	priorities	by	*-1	identifying	the	least	painful	program	cuts	as	they	moved	from	higher	to	lower	budgets	.
They	would	also	identify	the	best	way	0	*	to	add	programs	*T*-1	,	should	the	budget	come	in	at	higher	levels	.
This	kind	of	contingency	analysis	is	common	in	war	planning	and	business	planning	.
There	is	no	reason	that	it	can	not	be	done	*-1	for	defense	planning	*T*-2	.
Two	steps	are	necessary	*	to	translate	this	idea	into	action	.
Step	1	cleans	up	our	books	.
Our	five-year	plan	contains	three	accounting	devices	--	negative	money	,	an	above	guidance	management	reserve	and	optimistic	inflation	estimates	--	which	*T*-1	understate	the	spending	0	the	Pentagon	has	committed	itself	to	*T*-2	by	almost	$	100	billion	*U*	.
Negative	money	was	invented	*-95	in	1988	*	to	make	the	1990-94	Five	Year	Defense	Plan	conform	to	the	numbers	in	President	Reagan	's	final	budget	submission	to	Congress	.
That	plan	exceeded	the	numbers	contained	*	in	his	budget	message	by	$	45	billion	*U*	.
*-3	To	make	the	books	balance	,	as	*	is	required	*-4	by	law	,	somebody	invented	a	new	budget	line	item	that	*T*-2	simply	subtracted	$	45	billion	*U*	.
It	is	known	*-1	in	the	Pentagon	as	the	``	negative	wedge	.	''
The	Pentagon	argues	that	the	negative	wedge	is	the	net	effect	of	$	22	billion	*U*	in	the	as-yet	unidentified	procurement	reductions	that	it	intends	*-4	to	find	*T*-3	in	future	years	and	$	23	billion	*U*	in	an	``	above	guidance	''	management	reserve	that	*T*-1	accounts	for	undefined	programs	that	*T*-2	will	materialize	in	the	future	.
The	1990	plan	also	assumes	0	inflation	will	decline	to	1.7	%	by	1994	.
Most	forecasters	,	including	those	in	the	Congressional	Budget	Office	,	assume	0	inflation	will	be	in	excess	of	4	%	in	each	of	those	five	years	.
At	that	rate	,	the	defense	plan	is	underfunded	*-1	by	$	48	billion	*U*	.
By	*-2	adding	the	negative	wedge	and	recalculating	the	remaining	program	*-1	using	a	more	probable	inflation	estimate	,	we	arrive	at	a	baseline	program	costing	$	1.7	trillion	*U*	between	1990	and	1994	.
Step	2	examines	how	four	progressively	lower	budget	scenarios	would	change	the	baseline	*T*-1	and	how	these	changes	would	affect	our	national	security	*T*-2	.
The	graph	on	the	right	-LRB-	which	*T*-1	assumes	a	4	%	rate	of	inflation	-RRB-	,	places	these	scenarios	in	the	context	of	recent	appropriations	-LRB-	*	see	accompanying	illustration	--	WSJ	Oct.	30	,	1989	-RRB-	.
*	Note	how	the	baseline	program	assumes	a	sharp	increase	in	future	appropriations	*T*-1	.
Step	2	will	answer	the	question	:	What	*T*-1	happens	if	these	increases	do	not	materialize	?
Scenario	1	,	known	*	as	the	``	Constant	Dollar	Freeze	,	''	reimburses	the	Pentagon	for	inflation	only	--	it	slopes	upward	at	4	%	per	year	.
This	scenario	has	been	the	rough	position	of	the	U.S.	Senate	since	1985	,	and	it	reduces	the	baseline	by	$	106	billion	*U*	between	1990	and	1994	.
Scenario	3	,	the	``	Current	Dollar	Freeze	,	''	has	been	the	approximate	position	of	the	House	of	Representatives	for	about	four	years	.
It	freezes	the	budget	at	its	current	level	,	and	forces	the	Pentagon	to	eat	the	effects	of	inflation	until	1994	.
This	reduces	the	baseline	by	$	229	billion	*U*	.
Scenario	2	extends	the	recent	compromises	between	the	House	and	the	Senate	;	it	splits	the	difference	between	Scenarios	1	and	3	,	by	*-1	increasing	the	budget	at	2	%	per	year	.
It	reduces	the	baseline	by	$	169	billion	*U*	.
Finally	,	Scenario	4	reduces	the	budget	by	2	%	per	year	*ICH*-1	for	the	next	five	years	--	a	total	reduction	of	$	287	billion	*U*	.
This	can	be	thought	of	*-1	as	a	pessimistic	prediction	,	perhaps	driven	*	by	the	sequestering	effects	of	the	Gramm-Rudman	deficit	reduction	law	or	possibly	a	relaxation	of	tensions	with	the	Soviet	Union	.
The	strategic	planners	in	the	Joint	Chiefs	of	Staff	would	construct	the	most	effective	defense	program	for	each	scenario	,	*-1	maximizing	strengths	and	minimizing	weaknesses	.
They	would	conclude	their	efforts	by	*-1	producing	a	comprehensive	net	assessment	for	each	plan	--	including	the	assumptions	made	*	,	an	analysis	of	its	deficiencies	and	limitations	,	the	impact	on	national	security	,	and	the	best	strategy	for	*	working	around	these	limitations	.
This	exercise	would	reveal	the	true	cost	of	a	particular	program	by	*-1	forcing	the	strategists	to	make	hard	decisions	.
If	,	for	example	,	they	choose	*-1	to	keep	the	B-2	Stealth	bomber	,	they	would	have	*-2	to	sacrifice	more	and	more	other	programs	--	such	as	carrier	battlegroups	or	army	divisions	--	as	they	moved	toward	lower	budget	levels	.
These	trade-offs	would	evolve	priorities	by	*-2	revealing	when	the	cost	of	the	B-2	became	prohibitive	*T*-1	.
Some	may	be	tempted	*-1	to	argue	that	the	idea	of	a	strategic	review	merely	resurrects	the	infamous	Zero-Based	Budgeting	-LRB-	ZBB	-RRB-	concept	of	the	Carter	administration	.
But	ZBB	did	not	involve	the	strategic	planners	in	the	Joint	Chiefs	of	Staff	,	and	therefore	degenerated	into	a	bean-counting	drill	driven	*	by	budget	politics	.
Anyway	,	ZBB	's	procedures	were	so	cumbersome	that	everyone	involved	*	was	crushed	*-1	under	a	burden	of	marginalia	.
A	strategic	review	is	fundamentally	different	.
It	would	be	run	*-1	by	the	joint	chiefs	under	simple	directions	:	*	Produce	the	best	possible	force	for	each	budget	scenario	and	provide	the	Secretary	of	Defense	with	a	comprehensive	net	assessment	of	how	that	force	could	be	used	*-2	*-4	to	achieve	U.S.	goals	*T*-3	.
It	might	be	feared	*-1	that	*	even	thinking	about	lower	budgets	will	hurt	national	security	because	the	door	will	be	opened	*-2	to	opportunistic	budget	cutting	by	an	irresponsible	Congress	.
This	argument	plays	well	in	the	atmosphere	of	gaming	and	mistrust	permeating	the	Pentagon	and	Congress	,	and	unfortunately	,	there	is	some	truth	to	it	.
But	in	the	end	,	it	must	be	rejected	*-1	for	logical	as	well	as	moral	reasons	.
*	To	say	that	the	Pentagon	should	act	irresponsibly	because	*	acting	responsibly	will	provoke	Congress	into	*-1	acting	irresponsibly	leads	to	the	conclusion	that	the	Pentagon	should	deliberately	exaggerate	its	needs	in	the	national	interest	;	in	other	words	,	that	it	is	justified	in	*-2	committing	a	crime	--	*-2	lying	to	Congress	--	because	it	is	morally	superior	.
Strategy	is	not	a	game	between	the	Pentagon	and	Congress	;	it	is	the	art	of	the	possible	in	a	world	where	constraints	force	us	to	choose	between	unpleasant	or	imperfect	alternatives	*T*-1	.
If	we	want	meaningful	priorities	,	we	must	understand	the	trade-offs	0	they	imply	*T*-1	before	we	make	commitments	.
Strategy	is	not	a	separate	event	in	an	idealized	sequence	of	discrete	events	;	it	is	a	way	of	thinking	that	*T*-1	neutralizes	threats	to	our	interests	in	a	manner	consistent	with	our	financial	,	cultural	and	physical	limitations	.
Mr.	Spinney	is	a	permanent	Pentagon	official	.
This	is	a	condensed	version	of	an	essay	that	*T*-1	will	appear	in	the	January	issue	of	the	Naval	Institute	Proceedings	.

Although	bullish	dollar	sentiment	has	fizzled	,	many	currency	analysts	say	0	a	massive	sell-off	probably	wo	n't	occur	in	the	near	future	.
While	Wall	Street	's	tough	times	and	lower	U.S.	interest	rates	continue	*-1	to	undermine	the	dollar	,	weakness	in	the	pound	and	the	yen	is	expected	*-2	to	offset	those	factors	.
``	By	default	,	''	the	dollar	probably	will	be	able	*-1	to	hold	up	pretty	well	in	coming	days	,	says	0	*T*-2	Francoise	Soares-Kemp	,	a	foreign-exchange	adviser	at	Credit	Suisse	.
``	We	're	close	to	the	bottom	''	of	the	near-term	ranges	,	she	contends	0	*T*-1	.
In	late	Friday	afternoon	New	York	trading	,	the	dollar	was	at	1.8300	marks	and	141.65	yen	,	off	from	late	Thursday	's	1.8400	marks	and	142.10	yen	.
The	pound	strengthened	to	$	1.5795	*U*	from	$	1.5765	*U*	.
In	Tokyo	Monday	,	the	U.S.	currency	opened	for	trading	at	141.70	yen	,	down	from	Friday	's	Tokyo	close	of	142.75	yen	.
The	dollar	began	Friday	on	a	firm	note	,	*-2	gaining	against	all	major	currencies	in	Tokyo	dealings	and	early	European	trading	despite	reports	that	the	Bank	of	Japan	was	seen	*-1	unloading	dollars	around	142.70	yen	.
The	rise	came	as	traders	continued	*-1	to	dump	the	pound	after	the	sudden	resignation	Thursday	of	British	Chancellor	of	the	Exchequer	Nigel	Lawson	.
But	once	the	pound	steadied	with	help	from	purchases	by	the	Bank	of	England	and	the	Federal	Reserve	Bank	of	New	York	,	the	dollar	was	dragged	down	,	traders	say	0	*T*-2	,	by	the	stock-market	slump	that	*T*-1	left	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	with	a	loss	of	17.01	points	.
With	the	stock	market	wobbly	and	dollar	buyers	discouraged	*-2	by	signs	of	U.S.	economic	weakness	and	the	recent	decline	in	U.S.	interest	rates	that	*T*-1	has	diminished	the	attractiveness	of	dollar-denominated	investments	,	traders	say	0	the	dollar	is	still	in	a	precarious	position	.
``	They	'll	be	looking	at	levels	0	*	to	sell	the	dollar	*T*-2	,	''	says	*T*-1	James	Scalfaro	,	a	foreign-exchange	marketing	representative	at	Bank	of	Montreal	.
While	some	analysts	say	0	the	dollar	eventually	could	test	support	at	1.75	marks	and	135	yen	,	Mr.	Scalfaro	and	others	do	n't	see	the	currency	decisively	sliding	under	support	at	1.80	marks	and	140	yen	soon	.
Predictions	for	limited	dollar	losses	are	based	*-1	largely	on	the	pound	's	weak	state	after	Mr.	Lawson	's	resignation	and	the	yen	's	inability	*	to	strengthen	substantially	when	there	are	dollar	retreats	*T*-2	.
With	the	pound	and	the	yen	lagging	behind	other	major	currencies	,	``	you	do	n't	have	a	confirmation	''	that	a	sharp	dollar	downturn	is	in	the	works	,	says	0	*T*-1	Mike	Malpede	,	senior	currency	analyst	at	Refco	Inc.	in	Chicago	.
As	far	as	the	pound	goes	*?*	,	some	traders	say	0	a	slide	toward	support	at	$	1.5500	*U*	may	be	a	favorable	development	for	the	dollar	this	week	.
While	the	pound	has	attempted	*-1	to	stabilize	,	currency	analysts	say	0	it	is	in	critical	condition	.
Sterling	plunged	about	four	cents	Thursday	and	hit	the	week	's	low	of	$	1.5765	*U*	when	Mr.	Lawson	resigned	from	his	six-year	post	because	of	a	policy	squabble	with	other	cabinet	members	*T*-1	.
He	was	succeeded	*-1	by	John	Major	,	who	*T*-2	Friday	expressed	a	desire	for	a	firm	pound	and	supported	the	relatively	high	British	interest	rates	that	he	said	``	*T*-3	are	working	exactly	as	intended	''	in	*-4	reducing	inflation	.
But	the	market	remains	uneasy	about	Mr.	Major	's	policy	strategy	and	the	prospects	for	the	pound	,	currency	analysts	contend	0	*T*-1	.
Although	the	Bank	of	England	's	tight	monetary	policy	has	fueled	worries	that	Britain	's	slowing	economy	is	headed	*-1	for	a	recession	,	it	is	widely	believed	that	Mr.	Lawson	's	willingness	*	to	prop	up	the	pound	with	interest-rate	increases	helped	*-2	stem	pound	selling	in	recent	weeks	.
If	there	are	any	signs	that	Mr.	Major	will	be	less	inclined	*-1	to	use	interest-rate	boosts	*-2	to	rescue	the	pound	from	another	plunge	,	that	currency	is	expected	*-3	to	fall	sharply	.
``	It	*EXP*-1	's	fair	*	to	say	0	there	are	more	risks	for	the	pound	*ICH*-4	under	Major	than	there	were	*?*	under	Lawson	,	''	says	*T*-3	Malcolm	Roberts	,	a	director	of	international	bond	market	research	at	Salomon	Brothers	in	London	.
``	There	's	very	little	upside	to	sterling	,	''	Mr.	Roberts	says	*T*-2	,	but	he	adds	that	near-term	losses	may	be	small	because	the	selling	wave	that	*T*-1	followed	Mr.	Major	's	appointment	apparently	has	run	its	course	.
But	some	other	analysts	have	a	stormier	forecast	for	the	pound	,	particularly	because	Britain	's	inflation	is	hovering	at	a	relatively	lofty	annual	rate	of	about	7.6	%	and	the	nation	is	burdened	*-1	with	a	struggling	government	and	large	current	account	*RNR*-2	and	trade	*RNR*-2	deficits	.
The	pound	likely	will	fall	in	coming	days	and	may	trade	as	low	as	2.60	marks	within	the	next	year	,	says	0	*T*-1	Nigel	Rendell	,	an	international	economist	at	James	Capel	&	Co.	in	London	.
The	pound	was	at	2.8896	marks	late	Friday	,	off	sharply	from	2.9511	in	New	York	trading	a	week	earlier	.
If	the	pound	falls	closer	to	2.80	marks	,	the	Bank	of	England	may	raise	Britain	's	base	lending	rate	by	one	percentage	point	to	16	%	,	says	0	*T*-1	Mr.	Rendell	.
But	such	an	increase	,	he	says	0	*T*-2	,	could	be	viewed	*-1	by	the	market	as	``	too	little	too	late	.	''
The	Bank	of	England	indicated	its	desire	*	to	leave	its	monetary	policy	unchanged	Friday	by	*-4	declining	*-3	to	raise	the	official	15	%	discount-borrowing	rate	that	it	charges	discount	houses	*T*-1	,	analysts	say	0	*T*-2	.
Pound	concerns	aside	,	the	lack	of	strong	buying	interest	in	the	yen	is	another	boon	for	the	dollar	,	many	traders	say	0	*T*-1	.
The	dollar	has	a	``	natural	base	of	support	''	around	140	yen	because	the	Japanese	currency	has	n't	been	purchased	*-1	heavily	in	recent	weeks	,	says	0	*T*-2	Ms.	Soares-Kemp	of	Credit	Suisse	.
The	yen	's	softness	,	she	says	0	*T*-1	,	apparently	stems	from	Japanese	investors	'	interest	in	*	buying	dollars	against	the	yen	*-2	to	purchase	U.S.	bond	issues	and	persistent	worries	about	this	year	's	upheaval	in	the	Japanese	government	.
On	New	York	's	Commodity	Exchange	Friday	,	gold	for	current	delivery	jumped	$	5.80	*U*	,	to	$	378.30	*U*	an	ounce	,	the	highest	settlement	since	July	12	.
Estimated	volume	was	a	heavy	seven	million	ounces	.
In	early	trading	in	Hong	Kong	Monday	,	gold	was	quoted	*-1	at	$	378.87	*U*	an	ounce	.
We	are	deeply	disturbed	that	a	recent	editorial	stated	that	the	``	Americans	With	Disabilities	Act	of	1989	''	was	``	crafted	*-1	primarily	by	Democratic	Senators	Kennedy	and	Harkin	''	with	a	premise	``	based	on	the	presumption	that	most	Americans	are	hostile	to	the	disabled	...	.	''
Perhaps	even	more	offensive	is	*T*-1	the	statement	,	``	It	is	surprising	that	George	Bush	and	the	White	House	inner	circle	would	ally	themselves	with	this	crabby	philosophy	.	''
This	legislation	was	not	drafted	*-1	by	a	handful	of	Democratic	``	do-gooders	.	''
Quite	the	contrary	--	it	results	from	years	of	work	by	members	of	the	National	Council	on	the	Handicapped	,	all	appointed	*	by	President	Reagan	.
You	depict	the	bill	as	something	0	Democratic	leaders	``	hoodwinked	''	the	administration	into	*	endorsing	*T*-1	.
The	opposite	is	true	:	It	's	the	product	of	many	meetings	with	administration	officials	,	Senate	staffers	,	advocates	,	and	business	and	transportation	officials	.
Many	congressmen	are	citing	the	compromise	on	the	``	Americans	With	Disabilities	Act	of	1989	''	as	a	model	for	bipartisan	deliberations	.
Most	National	Council	members	are	themselves	disabled	*-1	or	are	parents	of	children	with	disabilities	.
We	know	firsthand	the	discrimination	addressed	*	by	the	act	:	*	to	be	told	*-1	0	there	's	no	place	for	your	child	in	school	;	*	to	spend	lonely	hours	at	home	because	there	is	no	transportation	for	someone	in	a	wheelchair	;	*	to	be	denied	*-2	employment	because	you	are	disabled	*-3	.
Your	editorial	mockingly	entitles	this	legislation	the	``	Lawyers	'	Employment	Act	.	''
For	the	43	million	people	with	disabilities	and	their	families	,	this	legislation	is	the	``	Emancipation	Proclamation	.	''

A	group	of	investors	led	*	by	Giant	Group	Ltd.	and	its	chairman	,	Burt	Sugarman	,	said	0	it	filed	with	federal	antitrust	regulators	for	clearance	*	to	buy	more	than	50	%	of	the	stock	of	Rally	's	Inc.	,	a	fast-food	company	based	*	in	Louisville	,	Ky	.
Rally	's	operates	and	franchises	about	160	fast-food	restaurants	throughout	the	U.S.	.
The	company	went	public	earlier	this	month	,	*-1	offering	1,745,000	shares	of	common	stock	at	$	15	*U*	a	share	.
Giant	has	interests	in	cement	making	and	newsprint	.
The	investor	group	includes	Restaurant	Investment	Partnership	,	a	California	general	partnership	,	and	three	Rally	's	directors	:	Mr.	Sugarman	,	James	M.	Trotter	III	and	William	E.	Trotter	II	.
The	group	currently	holds	3,027,330	Rally	's	shares	,	or	45.2	%	of	its	commmon	shares	outstanding	.
Giant	Group	owned	22	%	of	Rally	's	shares	before	the	initial	public	offering	.
A	second	group	of	three	company	directors	,	aligned	*	with	Rally	's	founder	James	Patterson	,	also	is	seeking	control	of	the	fast-food	chain	.
It	is	estimated	that	the	Patterson	group	controls	more	than	40	%	of	Rally	's	stock	.
Rally	officials	were	n't	available	*-1	to	comment	late	yesterday	.
For	the	year	ended	July	2	,	Rally	had	net	income	of	$	2.4	million	*U*	,	or	34	cents	a	share	,	on	revenue	of	$	52.9	million	*U*	.
Companies	listed	*	below	reported	quarterly	profit	substantially	different	from	the	average	of	analysts	'	estimates	.
The	companies	are	followed	*-1	by	at	least	three	analysts	,	and	had	a	minimum	five-cent	change	in	actual	earnings	per	share	.
Estimated	and	actual	results	involving	losses	are	omitted	*-1	.
The	percent	difference	compares	actual	profit	with	the	30-day	estimate	where	at	least	three	analysts	have	issues	forecasts	in	the	past	30	days	*T*-1	.
Otherwise	,	actual	profit	is	compared	*-1	with	the	300-day	estimate	.
DPC	Acquisition	Partners	,	a	hostile	suitor	for	Dataproducts	Corp.	,	filed	a	petition	in	federal	district	court	in	Los	Angeles	*-1	seeking	*-3	to	have	its	standstill	agreement	with	the	computer	printer	maker	declared	*-2	void	,	and	it	proceeded	with	a	$	10-a-share	*U*	tender	offer	for	the	company	.
The	offer	would	give	the	transaction	an	indicated	value	of	$	189	million	*U*	,	based	on	the	18.9	million	shares	0	the	group	does	n't	already	own	*T*-1	.
DPC	holds	about	7.8	%	of	Dataproducts	'	shares	.
Lawyers	representing	DPC	declined	*-1	to	elaborate	,	*-1	saying	0	they	did	n't	have	a	final	copy	of	the	filing	.
Jack	Davis	,	Dataproducts	'	chairman	,	said	0	he	had	n't	yet	seen	the	filing	and	could	n't	comment	.
DPC	made	a	$	15-a-share	*U*	bid	for	the	company	in	May	,	but	Dataproducts	management	considered	the	$	283.7	million	*U*	proposal	unacceptable	.
Dataproducts	had	sought	a	buyer	for	several	months	,	but	it	is	now	in	the	midst	of	a	restructuring	plan	and	management	says	0	the	company	is	no	longer	for	sale	.
Appalachian	Power	Co.	,	a	subsidiary	of	American	Electric	Power	Co.	,	said	0	it	will	redeem	on	Dec.	1	the	entire	$	44.2	million	*U*	of	its	12	7\/8	%	first	mortgage	bonds	due	2013	.
The	redemption	price	will	be	109.66	%	of	the	principal	amount	of	the	bonds	,	plus	accrued	interest	to	the	date	of	redemption	.
The	European	Community	's	consumer	price	index	rose	a	provisional	0.6	%	in	September	from	August	and	was	up	5.3	%	from	September	1988	,	according	to	Eurostat	,	the	EC	's	statistical	agency	.
The	month-to-month	rise	in	the	index	was	the	largest	since	April	,	Eurostat	said	0	*T*-1	.
Efforts	*ICH*-3	by	the	Hong	Kong	Futures	Exchange	*	to	introduce	a	new	interest-rate	futures	contract	continue	*-2	to	hit	snags	,	despite	the	support	0	the	proposed	instrument	enjoys	*T*-1	in	the	colony	's	financial	community	.
Hong	Kong	financial	institutions	have	been	waiting	for	interest-rate	futures	for	a	long	time	.
The	contract	was	first	proposed	*-2	more	than	two	years	ago	,	but	shortly	afterward	,	the	colony	's	markets	were	hit	*-1	hard	by	the	October	1987	global	stock	crash	.
The	subsequent	drive	*	to	reform	Hong	Kong	's	markets	also	has	embroiled	the	interest-rate	futures	contract	.
The	Securities	and	Futures	Commission	,	a	government	watchdog	set	*	up	after	the	1987	crash	*	to	try	*-1	to	restore	confidence	and	order	to	Hong	Kong	's	markets	,	had	been	expected	*-2	to	give	the	contract	conditional	approval	last	week	.
But	regulators	this	week	said	0	futures-exchange	officials	still	have	a	way	0	*	to	go	*T*-1	before	they	answer	all	the	remaining	detailed	questions	about	the	contract	.
The	exchange	had	forecast	that	the	contract	would	begin	*-1	trading	by	December	.
But	securities	regulators	now	say	privately	that	it	is	n't	likely	*-1	to	start	until	the	first	quarter	of	next	year	.
Analysts	and	financial	officials	in	the	British	colony	consider	the	new	contract	essential	to	the	revival	of	the	Hong	Kong	Futures	Exchange	,	which	*T*-1	has	never	fully	recovered	from	the	October	1987	crash	.
Many	believe	that	without	a	healthy	futures	exchange	,	Hong	Kong	's	aspirations	*	to	be	recognized	*-1	as	an	international	financial	center	will	suffer	.
In	addition	,	local	banks	say	0	the	new	contract	is	important	in	*	helping	them	offset	their	Hong	Kong-dollar	exposure	.
The	contract	will	be	based	*-1	on	the	three-month	Hong	Kong	interbank	offered	rate	,	or	Hibor	.
It	is	almost	a	carbon	copy	of	the	Chicago	Mercantile	Exchange	's	Eurodollar	contract	,	which	*T*-2	is	based	*-1	on	the	three-month	Eurodollar	rate	,	the	rate	paid	*	on	U.S.-dollar	deposits	in	London	banks	.
If	the	contract	is	as	successful	as	some	expect	*?*	,	it	may	do	much	*-1	to	restore	confidence	in	futures	trading	in	Hong	Kong	.
``	The	contract	is	definitely	important	to	the	exchange	,	''	says	*T*-1	Robert	Gilmore	,	executive	director	of	the	Securities	and	Futures	Commission	.
Two	years	ago	,	the	futures	exchange	was	the	envy	of	other	would-be	futures	centers	.
After	only	17	months	,	its	main	contract	,	based	on	the	Hang	Seng	index	,	had	grown	*-1	to	be	the	second-largest	stock-index-futures	contract	in	the	world	.
-LCB-	A	futures	contract	is	an	agreement	*	to	buy	or	sell	a	commodity	or	financial	instrument	at	a	set	price	on	a	specified	date	.
In	the	case	of	stock-index	and	interest-rate	futures	,	the	instruments	are	given	*-1	an	underlying	cash	value	and	are	settled	*-1	in	cash	.	-RCB-
But	in	the	week	following	the	1987	stock	crash	,	the	exchange	verged	on	collapse	,	and	the	stock	and	futures	markets	in	Hong	Kong	were	closed	*-1	for	four	days	.
Only	a	government-sponsored	bailout	kept	the	crisis	from	*-1	swallowing	the	exchange	.
*	Trading	in	Hang	Seng	index	futures	remains	crippled	by	the	experience	.
Volume	for	the	entire	month	of	September	totaled	only	21,687	contracts	,	compared	with	a	daily	average	of	27,000	in	the	month	before	the	1987	crash	.
Despite	the	thin	trading	,	and	after	two	painful	years	of	restructuring	,	the	futures	market	has	shown	itself	*-1	to	be	resilient	in	two	recent	tests	.
While	Asian	markets	struggled	*-1	to	cope	with	the	uncertainty	caused	*	by	the	Oct.	13	plunge	in	New	York	stock	prices	,	futures	trading	in	Hong	Kong	was	relatively	heavy	and	went	smoothly	.
That	was	also	the	case	in	the	days	following	the	June	4	massacre	in	Beijing	,	which	*T*-1	caused	a	sharp	drop	in	Hong	Kong	stock	prices	.
``	There	was	no	problem	at	all	,	''	says	*T*-1	Douglas	Ford	,	chief	executive	officer	of	the	futures	exchange	.
Most	important	to	the	contract	's	success	is	*T*-1	the	commitment	of	Hong	Kong	's	big	financial	institutions	,	especially	the	two	leaders	,	Hongkong	&	Shanghai	Banking	Corp.	and	the	local	subsidiary	of	Britain	's	Standard	Chartered	Bank	PLC	.
The	two	big	banks	were	instrumental	in	*	designing	the	new	contract	.
``	If	those	two	banks	are	there	,	then	the	balance	of	the	banking	institutions	will	be	there	,	''	says	*T*-1	Mr.	Gilmore	,	the	Securities	and	Futures	Commission	official	.
Colony	banks	have	a	major	stake	in	how	interest	rates	move	*T*-1	because	of	their	enormous	Hong	Kong-dollar	exposure	.
Even	though	the	currency	is	pegged	*-1	to	the	U.S.	dollar	,	with	a	fixed	exchange	rate	of	HK$	7.8	*U*	to	the	American	currency	,	the	U.S.	and	Hong	Kong	economies	do	n't	always	move	in	lock	step	,	*	making	it	*EXP*-3	difficult	*	to	predict	where	interest	rates	in	the	colony	will	go	*T*-2	.
In	early	1988	,	when	the	three-month	Eurodollar	rate	was	between	7	%	and	8	%	*U*	*T*-1	,	the	three-month	Hibor	rate	was	as	low	as	1	%	.
Just	a	few	months	ago	,	the	three-month	Eurodollar	rate	was	around	9.5	%	,	while	three-month	Hibor	hit	highs	above	11	%	.
The	Hibor	contract	``	solves	quite	a	bit	of	the	problem	of	interest-rate	risk	in	the	interbank	market	,	''	says	*T*-1	Eric	Cheng	,	a	director	of	James	Capel	-LRB-	Far	East	-RRB-	Ltd.	,	the	Hong	Kong	arm	of	the	British	brokerage	firm	.
Despite	the	initial	support	expected	*	,	trading	in	the	contract	is	likely	*-1	to	start	slowly	.
The	wounds	from	the	1987	crash	have	n't	yet	healed	,	and	not	all	claims	against	the	exchange	clearinghouse	--	by	those	who	*T*-2	bet	0	the	Hang	Seng	index	would	fall	--	have	been	settled	*-1	.
Companies	and	financial	institutions	familiar	with	Hong	Kong	remain	wary	of	*	trading	in	its	futures	market	.
And	Mr.	Gilmore	cautions	that	there	may	be	limits	on	how	much	the	contract	can	grow	*T*-1	because	the	Hong	Kong	dollar	is	n't	a	widely	traded	currency	.
He	says	0	the	contract	will	be	considered	*-1	a	success	if	it	starts	*-2	trading	500	to	1,000	lots	a	day	.
Exchange	officials	also	point	out	that	Hibor	futures	were	designed	*-1	for	institutions	and	corporations	,	not	for	the	type	of	small	individual	investors	who	*T*-2	were	very	active	in	Hang	Seng	index	futures	and	defaulted	in	the	1987	crash	.
Mr.	Cheng	says	0	the	low	margin	required	*	for	trading	futures	attracted	a	lot	of	small	investors	*ICH*-1	before	the	1987	crash	who	*T*-2	did	n't	realize	that	their	risk	was	virtually	unlimited	.
``	You	're	not	going	*-1	to	get	your	taxi	drivers	and	amahs	and	all	that	,	''	says	*T*-2	Rory	Nicholas	,	a	director	for	securities	company	Elders	Bullion	&	Futures	Ltd	.
That	should	help	*-2	to	inspire	confidence	,	Mr.	Gilmore	says	0	*T*-1	.
But	many	bankers	remain	nervous	,	especially	as	the	start-up	of	the	contract	continues	*-2	to	be	delayed	*-1	.
Two	of	Japan	's	largest	paper	manufacturers	,	Oji	Paper	Co.	and	Jujo	Paper	Co.	,	posted	unconsolidated	pretax	profit	gains	from	a	year	earlier	*ICH*-1	for	the	first	half	ended	Sept.	30	,	on	continuing	robust	domestic	demand	for	paper	products	.
Oji	Paper	,	the	nation	's	largest	in	terms	of	sales	,	said	0	its	pretax	profit	rose	1.5	%	to	23.11	billion	yen	-LRB-	US$	163.3	million	*U*	-RRB-	from	22.76	billion	yen	.
Sales	jumped	12.2	%	to	232.12	billion	yen	from	206.87	billion	yen	.
Net	income	increased	6.7	%	to	12.43	billion	yen	from	11.66	billion	yen	.
Per-share	net	rose	to	20.48	yen	from	19.51	yen	.
Oji	Paper	's	sales	strength	was	evident	in	overall	paper	products	sales	,	including	newsprints	,	printing	and	wrapping	papers	,	which	*T*-1	rose	to	221.61	billion	yen	in	the	first	half	from	200.70	billion	yen	a	year	earlier	.
Pulp	,	processed	and	miscellaneous	paper	sales	also	surged	.
For	the	full	fiscal	year	ending	next	March	,	Oji	predicted	that	total	sales	of	477.00	billion	yen	,	up	from	420.68	billion	yen	in	the	previous	fiscal	year	.
Pretax	profit	is	seen	*-1	at	45.00	billion	yen	,	down	from	47.17	billion	yen	,	while	net	income	is	estimated	*-2	at	23.500	billion	yen	,	up	from	23.031	billion	yen	.
The	company	did	n't	provide	an	explanation	for	the	softer	pretax	profit	performance	and	officials	could	n't	be	reached	*-1	for	comment	.
Jujo	Paper	said	0	its	pretax	profit	rose	0.3	%	to	13.05	billion	yen	from	13.02	billion	yen	.
Sales	rose	8.5	%	to	195.19	billion	yen	from	179.916	billion	yen	.
Net	income	surged	10	%	to	7.12	billion	yen	from	6.47	billion	yen	.
Per-share	net	rose	to	14.95	yen	from	14.44	yen	.
General	paper	product	sales	,	including	newsprints	and	other	papers	,	accounting	for	the	bulk	of	sales	,	rose	to	157.78	billion	yen	from	143.88	billion	yen	.
Jujo	Paper	predicted	that	for	the	full	fiscal	year	ending	next	March	31	,	sales	will	total	400.0	billion	yen	,	up	from	366.89	billion	yen	.
Pretax	profit	was	estimated	*-1	at	23.0	billion	yen	,	down	from	25.51	billion	yen	,	while	net	income	was	estimated	*-2	at	12	billion	yen	,	up	from	11.95	billion	yen	.
Unocal	Corp.	's	decision	*	to	put	its	Norwegian	oil	and	gas	interests	up	for	sale	earlier	this	week	is	another	step	in	the	company	's	strategic	review	of	its	properties	,	and	shows	that	few	of	them	are	sacred	cows	.
The	company	declined	*-1	to	estimate	the	value	of	the	Norwegian	holding	.
But	Eugene	L.	Nowak	,	an	analyst	at	Dean	Witter	Reynolds	Inc.	,	forecast	that	the	sale	will	bring	in	``	$	200	million	*U*	or	substantially	more	.	''
The	proposed	transaction	is	the	latest	in	a	redeployment	of	assets	by	the	Los	Angeles-based	oil	company	that	*T*-1	has	included	the	$	200	million	*U*	sale	of	its	headquarters	property	and	the	pending	sale	of	half	of	its	Chicago	refinery	and	related	marketing	operations	to	Petroleos	de	Venezuela	S.A	.
Mr.	Nowak	said	0	he	attaches	particular	importance	to	the	proposed	sale	because	it	suggests	that	the	company	is	willing	*-2	to	sell	oil	and	gas	assets	that	*T*-1	are	n't	part	of	its	major	strategic	strengths	.
Unocal	said	0	it	expects	*-1	to	complete	the	sale	of	its	Unocal	Norge	A\/S	unit	by	next	March	or	April	.
In	addition	to	an	18	%	stake	in	the	Veslefrikk	offshore	field	,	the	Norwegian	unit	has	interests	ranging	from	10	%	to	25	%	in	three	other	Norwegian	oil	and	gas	production	licenses	.
In	1986	,	Unocal	sold	a	7.5	%	stake	in	the	Veslefrikk	field	to	Deutsche	Erdolversorgungs	G.m.b	.	H.	,	a	West	German	oil	company	,	for	an	undisclosed	amount	.
In	1987	,	it	sold	a	2.5	%	stake	in	the	Veslefrikk	field	to	the	Swedish	national	oil	company	,	*	resulting	in	a	$	7	million	*U*	after-tax	gain	.
However	,	those	sales	were	early	in	the	field	's	history	,	before	production	equipment	was	installed	*-1	.
The	field	is	currently	being	developed	*-1	and	is	slated	*-1	to	start	production	by	the	end	of	the	year	.
It	's	expected	*-1	to	produce	about	62,000	barrels	per	day	.
A	company	spokesman	said	0	the	Veslefrikk	field	's	gross	reserves	were	estimated	*-1	in	1987	at	229	million	barrels	.
However	,	he	added	that	that	estimate	,	made	*	before	extensive	development	drilling	,	currently	is	being	reappraised	*-1	.
The	spokesman	said	0	Unocal	has	had	``	considerable	interest	''	from	prospective	buyers	.
The	company	has	retained	J.	Henry	Schroder	Wagg	&	Co.	as	financial	adviser	and	agent	for	the	sale	.
France	's	unemployment	rate	was	steady	at	a	seasonally	adjusted	9.5	%	in	September	,	the	Social	Affairs	Ministry	said	0	*T*-1	.

When	the	going	gets	tough	*T*-2	,	it	*EXP*-1	's	tough	*	to	trade	stocks	in	continental	Europe	.

They	say	0	the	recent	market	volatility	has	underscored	the	shortcomings	of	the	way	0	many	European	exchanges	trade	stocks	*T*-1	.
The	weaknesses	of	Continental	exchanges	are	driving	some	fund	managers	to	switch	business	to	stocks	traded	*	on	London	's	stock	exchange	,	which	*T*-1	quotes	firm	trading	prices	for	about	350	blue-chip	issues	from	12	major	countries	.

*-1	Unable	*-2	to	unload	a	large	block	of	a	French	blue-chip	company	's	shares	in	Paris	for	two	days	last	week	,	a	frustrated	Scottish	Amicable	fund	manager	finally	tossed	down	her	phone	in	disgust	and	called	James	Capel	&	Co.	,	a	London	brokerage	firm	.
The	firm	did	the	trade	in	seconds	on	the	London	stock	exchange	's	SEAQ	automated-quotation	system	.
On	so-called	Manic	Monday	,	Oct.	16	,	stock	prices	plunged	across	Europe	and	trading	problems	erupted	.
London	had	some	problems	,	too	.
The	London	exchange	's	electronic	price-reporting	system	provided	only	indicative	,	or	non-firm	,	prices	for	about	40	minutes	on	Manic	Monday	.
Some	dealers	say	0	other	traders	were	n't	picking	up	their	phones	.
But	London	's	problems	were	nothing	compared	with	the	Continent	's	.
In	Brussels	,	which	*T*-1	recently	spent	millions	of	dollars	on	a	computer-assisted	trading	system	,	disgusted	traders	watched	helplessly	as	a	software	failure	before	opening	on	Manic	Monday	prevented	trading	for	two	days	.

As	banks	processed	six-foot	telexes	of	sell	orders	,	the	crush	led	to	Manic	Monday	's	worst	decline	:	German	stocks	ended	down	13	%	.
Exchange	officials	extended	trading	hours	,	75	minutes	on	Monday	and	65	minutes	on	Tuesday	,	*-1	to	clear	up	order	backlogs	.

It	was	a	nightmare	,	''	says	*T*-1	Susan	Noble	,	an	investment	manager	at	Robert	Fleming	Holdings	Ltd.	's	International	Investment	Management	unit	in	London	.
``	It	*EXP*-2	's	very	worrying	that	these	markets	ca	n't	cope	.	''
On	Manic	Monday	,	the	volume	of	German	shares	traded	*	in	London	more	than	tripled	to	2.2	million	,	and	the	volume	of	French	shares	rose	48	%	.
-LRB-	By	comparison	,	German	domestic	stock	volume	in	Frankfurt	only	doubled	that	day	.	-RRB-
The	switch	to	the	London	market	during	such	turbulent	times	is	significant	.
For	one	thing	,	the	size	of	the	affected	market	is	enormous	--	the	European	stock	markets	account	for	some	22.5	%	of	global	stock	market	capitalization	,	with	an	estimated	value	of	$	2.175	trillion	*U*	,	according	to	Morgan	Stanley	Capital	International	.
The	Continental	markets	alone	contribute	about	14.3	%	of	estimated	world	market	capitalization	of	$	9.671	trillion	*U*	.
Though	the	widely	traded	shares	that	*T*-2	are	quoted	*-1	in	London	account	for	only	a	small	portion	of	those	totals	,	they	still	are	the	most	closely	watched	stocks	and	are	often	viewed	as	a	barometer	for	the	local	markets	generally	.
The	switch	to	London	underscores	the	fact	that	despite	the	economic	restructuring	associated	*	with	European	Community	efforts	*	to	develop	a	single	market	by	1992	,	European	stock	trading	remains	a	highly	fragmented	and	very	localized	activity	.
Against	this	backdrop	,	one	thing	that	*T*-1	does	n't	seem	likely	*-2	to	result	from	1992	is	a	single	European	stock	market	.
Rather	,	there	increasingly	is	a	group	of	international	brokerage	and	trading	firms	that	*T*-4	operate	in	most	European	financial	centers	--	including	European	giants	such	as	Barclays	Bank	PLC	and	Deutsche	Bank	,	as	well	as	Merrill	Lynch	&	Co.	and	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	Inc.	of	the	U.S.	and	Japan	's	Nomura	Securities	Co	.
These	firms	,	which	*T*-1	often	have	acquired	a	local	brokerage	firm	,	are	calling	the	shots	when	it	comes	to	*	deciding	in	which	market	*-2	to	transact	a	trade	*T*-3	*T*-4	.
And	senior	officials	of	two	U.S.	securities	houses	say	0	they	switched	trades	in	European	stocks	to	the	London	market	last	week	when	they	could	n't	unwind	positions	on	the	Continent	*T*-1	.
Meantime	,	brokers	on	the	Continent	are	worried	*ICH*-1	,	too	,	mostly	by	the	potential	loss	of	business	.
``	I	would	be	much	happier	if	this	volume	-LCB-	in	German	stocks	-RCB-	were	in	Frankfurt	rather	than	London	,	''	says	*T*-1	Dieter	Bauernfeind	,	head	of	international	equity	sales	at	Dresdner	Bank	in	Frankfurt	.
He	acknowledges	that	spreads	``	were	too	wide	and	volumes	too	light	''	in	the	extreme	conditions	on	Manic	Monday	.
Already	the	Germans	appear	*-1	to	be	acting	;	at	a	special	meeting	on	the	day	of	the	decline	,	directors	of	the	Frankfurt	Stock	Exchange	voted	*-2	to	extend	their	trading	hours	,	although	they	have	n't	decided	when	or	by	how	much	.
A	Frankfurt	exchange	official	,	*-1	acknowledging	the	brokers	'	anxieties	,	says	0	the	market	still	feels	0	it	``	functioned	OK	during	this	crash	.	''
The	Dutch	,	who	*T*-2	had	some	trading	problems	because	of	insufficient	computer	capacity	,	say	0	new	equipment	0	*T*-4	to	solve	the	problems	ought	*-1	to	be	installed	*-3	within	a	month	.
Says	*ICH*-1	a	spokeswoman	for	the	Brussels	Bourse	:	``	Nobody	around	here	will	tell	you	0	they	are	happy	0	the	system	did	n't	work	.
But	it	's	just	one	of	those	things	that	*T*-1	happened	.
Investors	can	be	assured	*-1	now	that	this	kind	of	problem	can	never	occur	again	.	''
But	for	others	,	the	pledges	echo	the	promises	made	*	after	the	1987	stock	crash	,	when	similar	problems	led	many	markets	to	develop	the	new	systems	that	*T*-1	performed	so	badly	last	week	.
``	They	all	said	0	they	invested	huge	amounts	of	money	.
But	they	either	did	n't	buy	the	right	machines	or	they	wasted	it	,	''	says	*T*-1	Fleming	's	Ms.	Noble	.
Canadian	steel	production	totaled	290,541	metric	tons	*ICH*-1	in	the	week	ended	*	Oct.	21	,	a	5.1	%	increase	from	276,334	tons	the	previous	week	but	a	7.2	%	decline	from	313,125	tons	a	year	earlier	,	Statistics	Canada	said	0	*T*-2	.
The	federal	agency	said	that	in	the	year	through	Oct.	21	production	totaled	12,573,758	tons	,	up	7.1	%	from	11,742,368	tons	.
Trinova	Corp.	said	0	it	will	resume	*-1	buying	back	as	many	as	three	million	of	its	common	shares	under	a	program	announced	*	two	years	ago	.
Trinova	,	which	*T*-1	had	34.2	million	common	shares	outstanding	Sept.	30	,	had	repurchased	29,700	shares	since	October	1987	before	this	latest	announcement	.
The	company	said	0	it	is	n't	*-1	making	a	commitment	*-2	to	purchase	a	specific	number	of	shares	.
In	New	York	Stock	Exchange	composite	trading	yesterday	,	Trinova	closed	at	$	32.125	*U*	,	up	12.5	cents	.
Calgene	Inc.	and	Gustafson	Inc.	said	0	they	plan	a	joint	project	0	*T*-1	to	develop	biological	products	0	*T*-2	to	control	such	plant	diseases	as	aflatoxin	,	a	potent	cancer-causing	agent	.
Under	the	plan	,	the	companies	will	use	Calgene	's	patented	technology	*-1	to	encapsulate	microbes	such	as	Bacillus	subtilis	,	a	bacterium	,	*-2	to	enhance	their	biological	activity	against	plant	diseases	.
Calgene	,	an	agricultural	biotechnology	concern	,	said	0	initial	work	will	concentrate	on	a	proprietary	strain	of	Bacillus	subtilis	which	*T*-1	has	shown	promise	for	*	controlling	aflatoxin	.
The	strain	was	discovered	*-1	by	Morinaga	&	Co.	and	licensed	*-1	to	Gustafson	,	a	unit	of	Uniroyal	Chemical	Co	.
Aflatoxin	is	released	*-1	by	molds	during	grain	and	seed	storage	.
The	recent	appearance	of	aflatoxin	in	such	foods	as	corn	and	peanut	butter	has	sparked	public	concern	and	consumer	scrutiny	of	food	handling	and	storage	procedures	.
European	Community	employers	fear	that	the	EC	Commission	's	plans	for	a	``	charter	of	fundamental	social	rights	''	is	a	danger	to	industrial	competitiveness	.
``	We	do	n't	want	Brussels	deciding	conditions	for	workers	unless	they	are	necessary	and	useful	,	''	said	*T*-1	Zygmunt	Tyszkiewicz	,	secretary	general	of	the	employers	'	confederation	Unice	.
Unice	--	an	acronym	for	the	Union	of	Industrial	and	Employers	'	Confederations	of	Europe	--	fears	that	the	charter	will	force	EC	countries	to	adopt	a	single	pattern	in	labor	relations	.
Workers	and	management	,	Mr.	Tyszkiewicz	said	0	*T*-2	,	would	lose	the	``	flexibility	and	diversity	''	that	*T*-1	has	so	far	allowed	them	to	adapt	to	local	conditions	and	traditions	.
The	British	government	also	strongly	opposes	the	charter	in	its	current	form	.
It	argues	,	as	does	*?*	Unice	,	that	labor	relations	are	best	left	*-2	to	be	regulated	*-1	at	the	national	level	.
France	will	propose	a	slightly	watered-down	version	of	the	charter	0	*T*-2	to	be	discussed	*-1	by	EC	social-affairs	ministers	on	Monday	,	officials	said	0	*T*-3	.
But	the	cosmetic	changes	are	n't	expected	*-1	to	win	over	Britain	.
``	We	still	have	serious	differences	with	the	text	,	''	a	British	official	said	*T*-1	,	because	it	provides	for	a	``	regulation	of	the	labor	market	.	''
Mr.	Tyszkiewicz	said	0	the	charter	would	put	poorer	EC	countries	such	as	Spain	,	Greece	and	Portugal	at	a	disadvantage	.
It	would	force	these	countries	to	introduce	minimum	standards	for	pay	and	working	hours	,	and	provide	for	collective	bargaining	and	worker	``	participation	''	in	major	corporate	decisions	.
This	,	he	warned	0	*T*-1	,	would	prevent	these	countries	from	*-2	bridging	the	difference	with	their	richer	EC	brethren	.
Indeed	,	lower	wages	--	in	Greece	,	they	are	a	third	of	the	EC	average	--	are	n't	enough	*-1	to	offset	higher	transport	costs	and	lower	productivity	in	the	southern	countries	.
*	Increasing	labor	costs	,	Mr.	Tyszkiewicz	argued	0	*T*-1	,	would	only	put	the	countries	at	a	further	disadvantage	in	*	competing	in	the	barrier-free	EC	market	planned	*	for	after	1992	.
But	the	Unice	official	said	that	*	producing	a	charter	acceptable	to	both	Britain	and	European	industry	is	n't	an	unattainable	goal	.
The	charter	would	just	have	*-2	to	be	restricted	*-1	to	a	list	of	workers	'	fundamental	rights	,	without	*	seeking	*-3	to	impose	any	norms	.
A	key	provision	in	the	current	version	of	the	charter	would	give	the	commission	a	mandate	0	*T*-1	to	produce	an	``	action	program	''	detailing	on	what	points	EC	member	states	would	be	required	*-2	to	comply	with	the	goals	set	*	out	in	the	charter	*T*-3	.
This	provision	lies	at	the	heart	of	the	British	and	Unice	fears	of	``	social	engineering	''	by	the	commission	.
One	possible	political	solution	,	an	EC	official	said	0	*T*-1	,	would	be	for	the	commission	to	present	the	action	program	in	late	November	,	before	the	adoption	of	the	charter	at	a	summit	of	EC	governments	on	Dec.	8	and	9	.
This	would	leave	Britain	free	*	to	adopt	the	charter	after	*	having	rebutted	the	action	program	.
The	charter	was	approved	*-1	by	the	EC	Commission	on	Sept.	21	.
France	's	Socialist	government	,	which	*T*-2	currently	holds	the	council	's	rotating	presidency	,	is	committed	*-1	to	*	having	the	charter	adopted	*-3	by	all	12	EC	states	before	the	end	of	1989	--	the	bicentennial	of	the	French	revolution	and	its	``	Universal	Declaration	of	Human	Rights	.
Bruno	DeGol	,	chairman	of	DeGol	Brothers	Lumber	,	Gallitzin	,	Pa.	,	was	named	*-1	a	director	of	this	bank-holding	company	,	*	expanding	the	board	to	11	members	.
Sam	Ramirez	and	his	men	are	late	.
They	pile	out	of	their	truck	and	furiously	begin	*-1	twisting	together	steel	pipes	linking	a	giant	storage	tank	to	the	Sharpshooter	,	a	freshly	drilled	oil	well	two	miles	deep	.
If	they	finish	today	,	the	Sharpshooter	can	pump	tomorrow	.
One	roustabout	,	*-1	hanging	by	his	hands	from	a	ladder	,	bounces	his	weight	on	a	three-foot	wrench	*-1	to	loosen	a	stuck	fitting	.
``	We	've	been	putting	in	long	hours	,	''	Mr.	Ramirez	says	*T*-1	--	six-day	weeks	and	13-hour	days	for	the	last	two	months	.
A	year	ago	,	when	almost	nothing	was	happening	amid	these	desolate	dunes	*T*-1	,	``	you	'd	spend	two	days	*-2	working	and	two	days	in	the	yard	,	''	he	recalls	0	*T*-3	.
After	a	three-year	nightmare	of	uncertain	oil	prices	,	draconian	budget	cuts	and	sweeping	layoffs	,	fear	is	finally	leaving	the	oil	patch	.
Independent	drillers	are	gingerly	sinking	bits	into	the	Earth	's	crust	again	.
Some	in	Big	Oil	are	easing	the	grip	on	their	wallets	.
Investment	capital	is	creeping	back	,	and	oil	properties	are	fetching	more	.
Oil-tool	prices	are	even	edging	up	.
What	*T*-1	happened	?
In	broadest	terms	,	stability	has	quietly	settled	into	international	oil	markets	.
Mideast	politics	have	calmed	down	and	the	squabbling	within	the	Organization	of	Petroleum	Exporting	Countries	seems	under	control	for	now	.
``	The	fundamentals	of	supply	and	demand	once	again	are	setting	oil	prices	,	''	says	*T*-1	Victor	Burk	,	an	Arthur	Andersen	&	Co.	oil	expert	.
After	years	of	wild	swings	,	oil	prices	over	the	last	12	months	have	settled	at	around	$	15	to	$	20	*U*	a	barrel	.
That	is	n't	the	$	40	*U*	that	*T*-1	delighted	producers	a	decade	ago	or	the	$	10	*U*	that	*T*-2	pleased	users	a	year	ago	.
But	it	is	high	enough	*	to	prod	the	search	for	future	supplies	,	low	enough	*	to	promote	consumption	and	,	most	important	,	steady	enough	for	both	producers	and	users	to	believe	in	*?*	.
Not	that	oil	suddenly	is	a	sure	thing	again	.
The	current	equilibrium	is	fragile	and	depends	on	steady	,	strong	demand	and	continued	relative	harmony	within	OPEC	,	producer	of	more	than	40	%	of	the	non-Communist	world	's	crude	.
A	recession	or	new	OPEC	blowup	could	put	oil	markets	right	back	in	the	soup	.
Also	,	the	new	stirrings	are	faint	,	and	some	question	their	extent	.
Drilling	activity	is	still	far	below	eight	years	ago	,	there	's	no	hiring	surge	and	some	companies	continue	*-1	to	shrink	.
With	all	this	,	even	the	most	wary	oil	men	agree	0	something	has	changed	.
``	It	does	n't	appear	*-1	to	be	getting	worse	.
That	in	itself	has	got	*-1	to	cause	people	to	feel	a	little	more	optimistic	,	''	says	*T*-2	Glenn	Cox	,	the	president	of	Phillips	Petroleum	Co	.
Though	*-1	modest	,	the	change	reaches	beyond	the	oil	patch	,	too	.
The	same	roller-coaster	prices	that	*T*-1	halted	U.S.	oil	exploration	and	drove	many	veteran	oil	men	and	companies	out	of	the	business	also	played	havoc	with	the	nation	's	inflation	rate	,	the	trade	deficit	and	oil	users	'	corporate	and	personal	budgets	.
Now	,	at	least	some	predictability	*ICH*-1	has	returned	,	for	everyone	from	economists	to	motorists	.
Corporate	planners	can	plan	again	.
``	Management	does	n't	want	surprises	,	''	notes	*T*-1	Jack	Zaves	,	who	,	as	fuel-services	director	at	American	Airlines	,	*T*-2	buys	some	2.4	billion	gallons	of	jet	fuel	a	year	.
Prices	had	been	so	unstable	that	two	years	ago	Mr.	Zaves	gave	up	on	long-term	forecasts	.
And	consumers	``	should	be	comfortable	,	''	adds	*T*-1	W.	Henson	Moore	,	U.S.	deputy	secretary	of	energy	.
``	I	do	n't	see	anything	on	the	horizon	that	*T*-1	could	lead	to	a	precipitous	rise	in	the	price	.	''
The	catalyst	for	all	this	has	been	OPEC	.
About	a	year	ago	,	it	ended	an	on-again	,	off-again	internal	production	war	that	*T*-1	had	put	prices	on	a	roller	coaster	and	pitched	oil	towns	from	Houston	to	Caracas	into	recession	.
Saudi	Arabia	,	OPEC	's	kingpin	,	abandoned	a	policy	of	*	flooding	the	market	*-1	to	punish	quota-cheaters	.
About	the	same	time	,	the	Iran-Iraq	war	,	which	*T*-1	was	roiling	oil	markets	,	ended	.
In	addition	,	global	petroleum	demand	has	been	climbing	.
It	is	projected	*-1	to	keep	growing	by	a	million	barrels	a	day	,	or	up	to	2	%	annually	,	for	years	0	*T*-2	to	come	.
For	OPEC	,	that	's	ideal	.
The	resulting	firm	prices	and	stability	``	will	allow	both	producers	and	consumers	to	plan	confidently	,	''	says	*T*-1	Saudi	Arabian	Oil	Minister	Hisham	Nazer	.
OPEC	Secretary-General	Subroto	explains	:	Consumers	offer	security	of	markets	,	while	OPEC	provides	security	of	supply	.
``	This	is	an	opportune	time	0	*T*-1	to	find	mutual	ways	0	-LCB-	*T*-2	to	prevent	-RCB-	price	shocks	from	*	happening	again	,	''	he	says	*T*-3	.
*-1	To	promote	this	balance	,	OPEC	now	is	finally	confronting	a	long-simmering	internal	problem	.
At	its	November	meeting	,	it	will	try	*-2	to	revise	its	quotas	*-3	to	satisfy	Persian	Gulf	members	that	*T*-1	can	produce	far	more	oil	than	their	allotments	.
*	Being	held	*-1	well	below	capacity	greatly	irritates	them	,	and	has	led	to	widespread	cheating	.
OPEC	has	repeatedly	raised	its	self-imposed	production	ceiling	*-1	to	legitimize	some	of	that	unauthorized	output	.
Oil	ministers	now	hope	*-3	to	solve	the	issue	for	good	through	an	Iranian	proposal	that	*T*-1	gives	a	larger	share	of	output	to	countries	with	surplus	capacity	and	reduces	the	shares	of	those	that	*T*-2	ca	n't	produce	more	anyway	.
But	``	if	they	walk	out	without	any	effort	*	to	resolve	their	problem	,	production	could	increase	to	23	million	or	24	million	barrels	a	day	,	*	making	for	a	very	troublesome	first	quarter	,	''	warns	0	*T*-2	Nordine	Ait-Laoussine	,	a	consultant	and	former	Algerian	OPEC	delegate	.
That	would	send	prices	*-2	plummeting	from	what	some	gun-shy	U.S.	oil	executives	still	regard	*T*-1	as	too	low	a	level	.
Patrick	J	.	Early	,	president	of	Amoco	Corp.	's	oil-production	unit	,	says	that	despite	recent	stability	,	he	plans	continued	tightening	of	costs	and	exploration	spending	.
The	view	of	some	others	in	Big	Oil	,	he	maintains	0	*T*-1	,	``	is	very	much	-LCB-	similar	to	-RCB-	Amoco	's	outlook	.	''
Just	this	week	Mobil	Corp.	disclosed	new	cutbacks	in	its	domestic	exploration	and	production	operations	.
Out	here	on	the	Querecho	Plains	of	New	Mexico	,	however	,	the	mood	is	more	upbeat	;	trucks	rumble	along	the	dusty	roads	and	burly	men	in	hard	hats	sweat	and	swear	through	the	afternoon	sun	.
Santa	Fe	Energy	Co.	,	a	unit	of	Santa	Fe	Southern	Pacific	Co.	,	bought	from	Amoco	the	rights	that	*T*-1	allowed	it	to	drill	the	Sharpshooter	.
A	mile	and	a	half	away	looms	the	150-foot-tall	rig	of	the	Sniper	,	due	*	to	be	pumping	by	December	.
``	Talk	is	that	everybody	is	going	*-1	to	drill	more	wells	,	''	says	*T*-2	foreman	Tommy	Folsom	.
Santa	Fe	aims	*-1	to	drill	about	30	wells	in	this	area	in	1989	and	double	that	next	year	.
It	is	more	aggressive	than	most	,	but	it	is	n't	the	only	company	with	a	new	attitude	,	as	it	found	when	it	went	looking	for	a	partner	for	the	Sharpshooter	*T*-1	.
``	We	went	to	six	companies	over	two	days	*-1	pitching	the	prospect	,	''	says	*T*-2	Tim	Parker	,	a	Santa	Fe	exploration	manager	.
``	Five	were	interested	.	''
Mitchell	Energy	&	Development	Corp.	became	the	partner	,	*-1	ponying	up	more	than	half	of	the	$	600,000	*U*	in	drilling	and	start-up	costs	.
Mitchell	will	get	a	half-interest	in	the	oil	.
``	A	kind	of	no-mistakes	mentality	''	had	been	stifling	activity	,	says	*T*-1	Don	Covey	,	Mitchell	's	oil	exploration	chief	.
Now	``	everybody	is	a	lot	more	optimistic	.	''
One	attraction	for	oil	operators	here	and	in	other	fields	is	the	bargain-basement	cost	of	drilling	and	equipment	,	reflecting	service	companies	'	hunger	for	work	.
Kadane	Oil	Co.	,	a	small	Texas	independent	,	is	currently	drilling	two	wells	itself	and	putting	money	into	three	others	.
One	of	its	wells	,	in	southwestern	Oklahoma	,	is	a	``	rank	wildcat	,	''	a	risky	well	where	oil	previously	has	n't	been	found	*-1	*T*-2	.
``	At	this	price	,	$	18	*U*	plus	or	minus	,	and	with	costs	being	significantly	less	than	they	were	*?*	several	years	ago	,	the	economics	are	pretty	good	,	''	*T*-2	says	George	Kadane	,	head	of	the	company	.
``	If	you	know	0	you	've	got	stability	in	price	,	you	can	do	things	0	you	would	n't	do	*T*-1	with	the	volatility	of	the	past	few	years	.	''
The	activity	is	enough	*	to	move	some	oil-service	prices	back	up	a	little	.
Some	drill-bit	prices	have	risen	5	%	in	the	past	month	.
In	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	,	a	boat	0	*T*-1	to	deliver	supplies	to	offshore	rigs	now	costs	around	$	3,000	*U*	a	day	,	up	nearly	60	%	since	June	.
Some	service	boats	recently	were	auctioned	*-1	for	about	$	1.7	million	*U*	each	,	up	from	less	than	$	1	million	*U*	two	years	ago	.
At	the	bottom	of	the	slump	,	Schlumberger	Inc.	was	discounting	75	%	on	an	electronic	evaluation	of	a	well	;	now	it	discounts	about	50	%	,	drillers	say	0	*T*-1	.
Still	,	there	is	money	0	*T*-2	to	be	made	*-1	.
Most	oil	companies	,	when	they	set	exploration	and	production	budgets	for	this	year	*T*-1	,	forecast	revenue	of	$	15	*U*	for	each	barrel	of	crude	produced	*	.
Prices	have	averaged	more	than	$	2	*U*	a	barrel	higher	than	that	--	not	a	windfall	,	but	at	least	a	pleasant	bonus	for	them	.
So	,	according	to	a	Dun	&	Bradstreet	Corp.	survey	,	companies	that	*T*-1	had	been	refusing	*-2	to	spend	even	their	very	conservative	budgets	may	loosen	up	before	year	end	.
It	says	0	40	%	of	those	surveyed	*	report	that	1989	exploration	spending	will	exceed	1988	's	.
Funds	for	drilling	may	inch	up	more	next	year	if	oil	prices	stay	stable	.
Texaco	,	thinking	in	terms	of	$	18-to-$19	*U*	oil	for	1990	,	may	raise	spending	,	especially	for	low-risk	prospects	,	an	official	says	0	*T*-1	.
Outside	investors	,	scarce	since	'86	,	are	edging	back	.
Although	``	it	*EXP*-1	's	still	difficult	*	to	raise	money	for	a	pure	wildcat	program	,	''	says	0	*T*-2	William	Thomas	,	a	Texas	Commerce	Bank	official	in	Houston	,	``	institutions	are	starting	*-3	to	see	0	there	are	cycles	to	these	things	,	and	this	one	is	beginning	*-4	to	turn	.	''
Wall	Street	generally	likes	the	industry	again	.
The	appetite	for	oil-service	stocks	has	been	especially	strong	,	although	some	got	hit	yesterday	when	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	cut	its	short-term	investment	ratings	on	them	*T*-1	.
Contractors	such	as	Parker	Drilling	Co.	are	raising	cash	again	through	stock	offerings	,	and	for	the	first	time	in	years	,	two	oil-service	companies	recently	went	public	.
-LRB-	They	are	Grace	Energy	Corp.	of	Dallas	and	Marine	Drilling	Co.	of	Houston	.	-RRB-
Most	oil	companies	are	still	reluctant	*-2	to	add	to	the	office	and	professional	staffs	0	they	slashed	*T*-1	so	deeply	.
But	a	few	new	spots	are	opening	.
Arthur	Andersen	,	the	accounting	firm	,	has	increased	its	energy	staff	10	%	in	a	year	.
Out	in	the	oil	fields	,	if	activity	picks	up	much	more	,	shortages	could	appear	because	so	many	roughnecks	,	roustabouts	and	others	left	after	the	crash	.
Already	``	it	*EXP*-2	's	hard	*	to	get	people	.
They	're	so	busy	,	''	says	*T*-1	one	Santa	Fe	drilling	foreman	here	.
For	most	field	workers	,	it	's	about	time	.
Mr.	Ramirez	,	who	*T*-1	arrived	late	at	the	Sharpshooter	with	his	crew	because	he	had	started	early	in	the	morning	*-3	setting	up	tanks	at	another	site	,	just	got	the	first	raise	0	he	can	remember	*T*-2	in	eight	years	,	to	$	8.50	*U*	an	hour	from	$	8	*U*	.
Norman	Young	,	a	``	mud-logger	''	at	the	Sniper	well	,	has	worked	all	but	about	nine	days	of	this	year	.
Last	year	,	``	I	was	off	a	straight	month	,	then	one	time	for	two	to	three	weeks	and	another	two	to	three	weeks	,	''	he	says	0	*T*-1	.
Butch	McCarty	,	who	*T*-1	sells	oil-field	equipment	for	Davis	Tool	Co.	,	is	also	busy	.
*-1	A	native	of	the	area	,	he	is	back	now	after	*	riding	the	oil-field	boom	to	the	top	,	then	surviving	the	bust	*-2	running	an	Oklahoma	City	convenience	store	.
``	First	year	0	I	came	back	*T*-2	there	was	n't	any	work	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	I	think	0	it	's	on	the	way	back	now	.

No	major	booms	,	no	major	setbacks	,	''	he	predicts	*T*-1	.
Business	has	been	good	enough	that	he	just	took	a	spur-of-the-moment	weekend	trip	to	the	mountain	area	of	Cloudcroft	,	something	``	0	I	have	n't	done	*T*-1	in	years	.	''
The	figures	confirm	that	there	certainly	is	n't	any	drilling	boom	.
Only	14,505	wells	,	including	4,900	dry	holes	,	were	drilled	*-1	for	oil	and	natural	gas	in	the	U.S.	in	the	first	nine	months	of	the	year	,	down	22.4	%	from	the	like	1988	period	.
But	that	was	off	less	than	at	midyear	,	when	completions	lagged	by	27.1	%	.
And	the	number	of	rigs	active	in	the	U.S.	is	inching	up	.
According	to	Baker	Hughes	Inc.	,	992	rotary	rigs	were	at	work	in	the	U.S.	last	week	,	up	from	the	year-ago	count	of	933	.
-LRB-	In	1981	,	before	the	bust	,	the	rig	count	was	above	4,000	.	-RRB-
Global	offshore-rig	use	shows	a	similar	upward	trend	.
Some	equipment	going	to	work	is	almost	new	.
Grace	Energy	just	two	weeks	ago	hauled	a	rig	here	500	miles	from	Caspar	,	Wyo.	,	*-1	to	drill	the	Bilbrey	well	,	a	15,000-foot	,	$	1-million-plus	*U*	natural	gas	well	.
The	rig	was	built	*-1	around	1980	,	but	has	drilled	only	two	wells	,	the	last	in	1982	.
Until	now	it	had	sat	idle	.
For	Zel	Herring	,	owner	and	a	cook	at	the	Sandhills	Luncheon	Cafe	,	a	tin	building	in	midtown	,	all	this	has	made	for	a	very	good	year	.

Mike	Huber	,	a	roustabout	,	is	even	making	it	in	his	new	career	as	an	entrepreneur	.

That	's	the	word	.
The	word	is	out	.
Eight	people	,	including	a	supervisor	of	Security	Pacific	National	Bank	's	central	vault	,	were	arrested	*-1	in	an	investigation	of	an	alleged	drug	money-laundering	operation	.
The	U.S.	Attorney	's	office	filed	a	criminal	complaint	against	six	bank	employees	*-2	charging	them	with	conspiracy	in	the	scheme	,	which	*T*-1	apparently	was	capable	of	*	handling	millions	of	dollars	a	week	by	*-3	funneling	cash	through	fictitious	bank	accounts	.
Two	other	men	also	were	charged	*-1	with	*	participating	in	the	operation	.
The	arrests	capped	a	four-month	investigation	by	the	Internal	Revenue	Service	,	the	U.S.	Attorney	's	office	and	a	Security	Pacific	internal	investigation	team	.
Walter	S.	Fisher	,	executive	vice	president	and	general	auditor	of	the	bank	's	parent	,	Security	Pacific	Corp.	,	said	0	no	bank	funds	were	at	risk	during	the	investigation	.
Arrested	*-1	were	*T*-2	Jose	O.	Lopez	,	27	years	old	,	of	Whittier	,	Calif.	,	the	vault	supervisor	;	Carlos	O.	Huerta	,	29	,	of	La	Puente	;	Luis	A.

Geno	M.	Apicella	,	27	,	of	Los	Angeles	,	and	Terrell	N.	Madison	,	27	,	of	Hawthorne	,	were	also	charged	*-1	with	*	participating	in	the	conspiracy	.
Each	defendant	faces	a	possible	sentence	of	20	years	in	prison	and	$	250,000	*U*	in	fines	.
The	defendants	could	n't	immediately	be	reached	*-1	for	comment	.
S.A.	Brewing	Holdings	Ltd.	began	*-1	laying	the	groundwork	0	*T*-2	to	launch	a	rival	offer	for	Bond	Corp	.	Holdings	Ltd.	's	Australian	brewing	operations	.
Such	an	offer	could	torpedo	a	plan	*ICH*-1	by	Lion	Nathan	Ltd.	of	New	Zealand	*	to	acquire	half	the	brewing	interests	.
But	it	would	probably	increase	the	amount	of	cash	that	debt-ridden	Bond	Corp.	would	earn	*T*-1	from	the	transaction	.
Australia	's	National	Companies	and	Securities	Commission	said	0	it	will	allow	S.A.

's	brewing	businesses	for	2.5	billion	Australian	dollars	-LRB-	US$	1.93	billion	*U*	-RRB-	.
S.A.	Brewing	,	which	*T*-1	is	20%-owned	by	Elders	IXL	Ltd.	,	Australia	's	largest	brewer	,	will	make	a	takeover	offer	for	all	of	Bell	Resources	if	it	exercises	the	option	,	the	corporate	regulators	said	0	*T*-2	in	a	statement	.
Bond	Corp.	,	a	brewing	,	property	,	media	and	resources	concern	controlled	*	by	financier	Alan	Bond	,	is	selling	many	of	its	assets	*-1	to	reduce	an	A$	6.9	billion	*U*	debt	.
Contrary	to	what	*T*-3	might	be	expected	*-1	based	on	the	headline	on	John	R.	Dorfman	's	recent	Money	Matters	article	-LRB-	``	Pros	Hit	Theorists	Right	Where	It	Hurts	*T*-4	''	Oct.	3	-RRB-	,	I	was	able	*-5	to	stand	proudly	before	my	undergraduate	finance	students	and	proclaim	that	the	findings	of	your	yearlong	experiment	on	stock	picking	is	completely	consistent	with	what	they	have	been	taught	*-2	*T*-6	in	the	classroom	.
In	particular	,	I	do	not	find	the	fact	that	your	group	of	pros	'	monthly	selections	of	four	stocks	outperforms	the	market	in	general	to	be	inconsistent	with	market	efficiency	.
Mr.	Dorfman	states	that	an	investor	who	*T*-1	invested	$	100,000	*U*	a	year	ago	in	the	first	four	stocks	selected	*	by	your	pros	and	then	sold	those	one	month	later	,	*-2	purchasing	the	four	new	pro	picks	,	and	repeated	this	process	for	the	year	would	have	accumulated	$	166,537	*U*	,	excluding	account	dividends	,	taxes	and	commissions	.
In	contrast	,	an	investor	holding	the	Dow	Jones	portfolio	over	the	year	would	have	accumulated	only	$	127,446	*U*	.
Accepted	theories	of	asset	pricing	offer	a	perfectly	legitimate	explanation	.
Accepted	theories	state	that	investors	require	higher	returns	on	riskier	investments	.
Thus	,	rather	than	*	seeing	the	excess	returns	to	the	pro-selected	portfolio	as	*	being	abnormal	,	I	see	those	returns	as	simply	compensations	for	*	taking	on	added	risk	.
I	believe	0	the	risk	for	each	individual	stock	selected	*	by	your	pros	is	very	large	.
If	you	asked	me	*-1	to	select	a	stock	with	the	highest	expected	return	,	I	would	select	a	stock	with	the	greatest	amount	of	undiversifiable	risk	,	as	I	am	sure	0	your	pros	do	*?*	.
Your	hypothetical	investor	is	simply	being	compensated	*-1	for	*	taking	on	this	added	risk	.
Moreover	,	your	hypothetical	investor	has	forsaken	the	gains	0	*T*-2	to	be	had	*-1	in	*	reducing	risk	by	*	diversifying	his	portfolio	.
A	four-stock	portfolio	is	still	exposed	to	a	great	deal	of	unnecessary	risk	.
This	means	0	the	returns	can	vary	a	great	deal	.
Mr.	Dorfman	provides	confirming	evidence	of	this	phenomenon	when	he	reports	that	your	staff	of	dart	throwers	would	have	accumulated	only	$	112,383	*U*	by	*	randomly	selecting	four	new	stocks	0	*T*-2	to	be	held	*-1	in	a	portfolio	each	month	*T*-3	.
Scott	E.	Hein	Texas	Tech	University	Lubbock	,	Texas	Your	Investment	Dartboard	article	misses	the	target	.
The	fact	that	stock	pickers	have	bested	a	randomly	selected	portfolio	in	eight	of	12	months	has	no	bearing	on	the	efficient-market	theory	.
What	*T*-1	matters	is	that	the	stocks	recommended	*	by	your	pros	tend	*-2	to	be	substantially	riskier	than	a	diversified	portfolio	.
For	example	,	your	pickers	'	recommendations	for	the	coming	month	are	,	on	average	,	22.5	%	riskier	than	*	holding	the	market	portfolio	according	to	Value	Line	's	Beta	estimates	.
James	Morgan	's	pick	for	October	--	Dynascan	--	is	a	substantial	35	%	riskier	than	the	market	portfolio	;	his	lauded	Thermo	Electron	pick	is	40	%	riskier	.

California	Thefts	Make	Travel	Agents	Jittery
*	BEING	A	TRAVEL	agent	used	*-1	to	be	pretty	glamorous	.
Now	it	's	getting	downright	dangerous	.
In	recent	months	,	more	than	25	agencies	have	been	robbed	*-1	,	compared	with	only	a	handful	all	last	year	,	according	to	police	and	travel-agency	groups	.
Most	of	the	cases	have	been	in	California	,	where	one	agent	was	stabbed	*-1	and	another	was	shot	and	killed	*-2	*T*-3	.
Los	Angeles	police	say	0	the	thieves	seem	*-2	to	be	part	of	a	crime	network	that	*T*-1	knows	how	*-3	to	convert	blank	tickets	into	real	ones	*T*-4	.
Already	,	the	stolen	tickets	have	been	used	*-1	for	flights	all	over	the	world	.
So	far	,	the	thieves	have	stolen	3,632	blank	tickets	,	according	to	Airline	Reporting	Corp.	,	a	ticket	processing	center	.
Police	say	0	the	robberies	are	usually	pulled	*-2	off	by	two	to	five	men	,	who	*T*-1	walk	into	the	agencies	near	closing	or	lunch	time	,	when	few	employees	are	there	*T*-3	.
``	They	looked	like	ordinary	vacationers	at	first	,	''	says	*T*-2	Willy	LLerena	,	owner	of	Travel	Air	Service	in	Monte	Bello	,	Calif.	,	*	describing	five	men	who	*T*-1	entered	his	agency	last	June	.
But	then	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	,	they	put	two	loaded	pistols	to	his	temple	and	demanded	0	he	open	the	safe	.
When	he	initially	refused	*T*-1	,	he	says	0	*T*-2	,	they	stabbed	him	in	the	back	and	made	off	with	$	2,000	*U*	and	280	blank	tickets	.
``	They	said	0	they	wanted	*-1	to	show	me	how	serious	they	were	*T*-2	,	''	he	says	*T*-3	.
As	word	of	the	crime	spree	has	spread	,	many	agents	have	started	*-1	changing	their	open-door	policies	.
At	El	Monte	Travel	Center	in	El	Monte	,	Calif.	,	customers	now	can	get	in	only	through	a	buzzer	and	lock	system	.
``	It	*EXP*-1	's	hard	*	to	deal	with	clients	this	way	in	a	service	business	,	''	says	*T*-4	Ralph	``	Bud	''	Conner	,	owner	of	the	agency	,	which	*T*-3	was	robbed	*-2	of	180	blank	tickets	and	$	850	*U*	last	month	.
``	But	we	're	just	too	nervous	.	''
The	robberies	also	have	set	off	a	controversy	involving	the	airlines	.
Agents	say	0	airlines	,	which	*T*-1	track	ticket	numbers	of	all	stolen	tickets	,	should	be	doing	more	*-2	to	catch	the	thieves	by	*	confiscating	the	tickets	when	they	're	used	*-3	*T*-4	.
``	They	have	the	most	sophisticated	computers	in	the	world	,	''	says	*T*-1	Mr.	LLerena	.
``	They	ought	*-1	to	be	able	*-1	to	do	this	.	''
But	airlines	say	0	it	would	be	too	expensive	and	cause	too	many	delays	if	they	started	*-1	using	computerized	scanners	*-2	to	check	tickets	at	the	gate	.
Texans	Get	Reasonable	Car	Rental	Insurance
CONSUMER	advocates	have	long	claimed	that	car	rental	companies	charge	too	much	for	car	rental	insurance	.
Now	,	a	new	law	in	Texas	seems	*-1	to	be	providing	the	proof	.
The	law	--	the	first	of	its	kind	--	requires	car	rental	companies	in	Texas	to	charge	only	``	reasonable	''	rates	for	collision-damage	waiver	insurance	.
Specifically	,	the	law	says	0	the	rates	must	closely	reflect	what	the	company	's	actual	expenses	have	been	*T*-1	*	to	replace	damaged	cars	.
Before	the	law	went	into	effect	last	month	,	car	rental	companies	were	charging	as	much	as	$	12	*U*	a	day	for	the	waiver	in	Texas	.
Now	,	they	're	charging	as	little	$	3	*U*	a	day	.
``	If	they	're	telling	the	truth	now	,	then	they	've	been	charging	300	%	more	than	what	*T*-1	is	reasonable	,	''	says	*T*-2	Steve	Gardner	,	an	assistant	state	attorney	general	in	Texas	.
A	spokesman	for	Hertz	Corp.	acknowledges	,	``	The	waiver	is	n't	a	source	of	protection	for	consumers	,	but	a	source	of	revenue	.	''
But	Hertz	points	out	that	at	least	it	's	now	charging	only	$	3.95	*U*	a	day	in	Texas	,	while	some	competitors	are	charging	$	6.99	*U*	.
The	state	attorney	general	's	office	is	investigating	rental	car	agencies	charging	noticeably	higher	prices	.
Flight	Attendants	Lag	Before	Jets	Even	Land
IF	YOUR	FLIGHT	attendant	seems	a	little	weary	,	it	may	be	because	he	or	she	has	been	working	20	straight	hours	.
A	recent	study	for	the	Federal	Aviation	Administration	found	that	major	airlines	sometimes	make	flight	attendants	work	16	hours	or	more	straight	--	despite	union	contracts	at	some	airlines	limiting	duty	time	to	14	hours	.
Some	flight	attendants	on	charter	planes	are	putting	in	20-hour	work	days	,	the	study	found	0	*T*-1	.
This	happens	because	the	FAA	does	n't	have	any	rules	on	duty	time	for	flight	attendants	;	by	contrast	,	it	strictly	restricts	duty	time	for	pilots	and	air	traffic	controllers	,	usually	to	a	maximum	of	10	consecutive	hours	.
``	As	far	as	the	FAA	is	concerned	*-1	,	''	says	*T*-3	Matt	Finucane	,	air	safety	director	at	the	Association	of	Flight	Attendants	,	``	flight	attendants	can	work	an	unlimited	number	of	hours	.	''
Experts	say	0	such	long	hours	for	attendants	pose	a	safety	risk	.
For	instance	,	tired	flight	attendants	might	not	react	quickly	enough	during	an	emergency	evacuation	.
``	At	the	end	of	their	day	,	they	are	zombies	,	''	says	*T*-1	John	Galipault	,	president	of	the	Aviation	Safety	Institute	,	a	public-interest	group	in	Worthington	,	Ohio	.
``	They	have	*-1	to	work	such	long	hours	and	then	we	expect	them	to	be	heroes	if	there	's	an	evacuation	.	''
In	response	to	the	study	,	the	FAA	says	0	it	is	considering	*-1	changing	its	policy	--	or	lack	of	it	--	on	flight	attendants	.
The	agency	may	not	have	much	choice	:	A	congressional	bill	*ICH*-1	has	been	introduced	*-2	that	*T*-3	would	force	the	agency	to	limit	flight	attendant	duty	time	to	14	hours	on	U.S.	flights	and	16	hours	on	international	trips	.
Odds	and	Ends
GOLF	HAS	BECOME	the	latest	diversion	for	travelers	stuck	*	at	some	airports	.

Why	do	you	continually	ignore	the	salubrious	effects	of	*	indexing	the	basis	of	capital	gains	for	inflation	*T*-1	?
Why	do	you	maintain	0	the	House-passed	capital-gains	plan	is	a	``	temporary	''	reduction	when	it	is	not	*?*	*T*-1	*T*-2	?
I	think	0	the	reason	is	that	you	are	confusing	tax	``	rates	''	with	tax	``	payments	.	''
Your	Sept.	29	page-one	story	on	the	House-passed	capital-gains	plan	is	a	good	example	.
You	lead	readers	to	believe	that	the	House	reduced	the	capital-gains	tax	for	two	years	only	.
You	virtually	ignore	the	tax-reducing	power	of	indexation	,	which	in	many	cases	*T*-1	is	more	substantial	than	a	lower	rate	.
The	monetary	tax	benefit	of	indexation	for	all	gains	in	excess	of	inflation	can	be	measured	*-1	*	using	the	following	equation	:	tax	rate	,	times	inflation	rate	,	times	basis	for	the	gain	.
Depending	on	the	size	of	the	gain	and	the	rate	of	inflation	,	indexation	can	mean	a	lower	tax	payment	than	*	using	the	19.6	%	rate	without	indexation	.
But	in	any	event	--	and	this	is	the	important	point	--	tax	``	payments	''	on	capital	gains	will	be	lower	with	indexation	than	under	current	law	,	even	though	the	tax	``	rate	''	is	the	same	under	both	systems	.
As	you	can	see	,	the	capital-gains	reduction	plan	adopted	*	by	the	House	would	not	be	temporary	,	but	permanent	.
I	hope	that	you	begin	*-1	talking	about	the	plan	's	permanent	and	,	in	my	view	,	most	beneficial	feature	--	indexation	.
Rep.	Robert	K.	Dornan	-LRB-	R.	,	Calif	.	-RRB-	Washington
That	the	motivation	for	the	two-year	reduction	to	19.6	%	is	budgetary	does	not	mean	0	it	is	not	in	the	public	interest	.
The	reduction	eases	the	burden	on	portfolio	changes	and	frees	capital	*-1	to	seek	more	productive	or	more	appropriate	uses	.
But	what	*T*-1	is	really	significant	is	the	indexation	of	capital	gains	after	1991	.
*	To	argue	that	this	is	``	not	likely	''	*-1	to	affect	the	economy	in	positive	ways	is	contrary	both	to	recent	experience	with	capital-gains	tax	cuts	and	to	common	sense	.
A	large	part	of	the	long-term	appreciation	of	assets	reflects	inflation	,	and	the	taxation	of	inflation-created	capital	gains	is	confiscation	.
Does	the	Journal	really	believe	that	people	ignore	the	prospect	of	*	having	a	substantial	part	of	their	capital	confiscated	*-1	when	they	decide	whether	*-2	to	save	or	how	*-2	to	invest	*T*-3	*T*-4	?
Under	current	law	,	it	*EXP*-1	is	not	financially	rational	*	to	forgo	consumption	.
Real	,	aftertax	returns	from	financial	assets	are	on	the	order	of	1	%	or	2	%	a	year	.
The	capital-gains	tax	reform	is	a	step	toward	*	correcting	one	of	the	gravest	structural	weaknesses	of	the	U.S.	economy	,	the	closely	connected	phenomena	of	low	savings	rates	,	weak	capital	formation	and	high	capital	costs	.
J.	Sigurd	Nielsen	Richmond	,	Va	.
Isaac	Hersly	,	41	years	old	,	was	elected	*-1	president	and	chief	operating	officer	of	this	designer	and	marketer	of	graphics	,	video	,	cable	and	other	television-related	equipment	.
He	succeeds	Alfred	O.P.	Leubert	,	66	,	who	*T*-1	continues	as	chairman	and	chief	executive	officer	.
Mr.	Hersly	formerly	was	group	vice	president	of	marketing	and	product	planning	for	Chyron	and	president	of	the	telesystems	and	video	products	division	.
W.R.	Grace	&	Co.	said	0	it	formed	a	new	horticultural-products	company	by	*	combining	its	soil-nutrients	and	fertilizers	business	with	Sierra	Chemical	Co.	,	Milpitas	,	Calif	.
Grace	,	a	maker	of	specialty	chemicals	that	*T*-1	already	owned	about	30	%	of	closely	held	Sierra	,	said	0	it	owns	a	49	%	stake	in	the	new	company	.
Grace	said	0	it	did	n't	invest	any	additional	capital	in	the	venture	,	which	*T*-2	will	be	known	*-1	as	Grace-Sierra	Horticultural	Products	Co	.
The	business	is	expected	*-1	to	have	sales	of	about	$	100	million	*U*	in	1990	,	Grace	said	0	*T*-2	.
The	new	company	's	product	lines	will	be	aimed	*-1	at	nurseries	,	greenhouses	and	the	lawn	and	garden	industry	.
The	Financial	Accounting	Standards	Board	said	0	it	will	soon	issue	a	rule	requiring	disclosure	about	the	financial	risk	of	certain	financial	instruments	.
But	the	chief	rule-making	body	for	accountants	backed	off	one	part	of	its	original	proposal	made	*	earlier	this	year	that	*T*-1	would	have	required	a	breakdown	of	certain	balance-sheet	items	related	*	to	off-balance	sheet	instruments	.
The	balance-sheet	detail	was	opposed	*-1	by	many	banks	and	thrifts	that	*T*-2	felt	0	the	cost	of	*	supplying	such	data	was	n't	worth	the	value	of	the	disclosures	.
Under	the	initial	proposal	,	for	example	,	banks	would	have	been	required	*-2	to	disclose	that	portion	of	allowances	for	loan	losses	that	*T*-1	reflects	specific	letters	of	credit	for	which	customers	had	defaulted	*T*-3	.
The	final	rule	wo	n't	require	such	a	breakdown	of	the	allowances	for	loan	losses	,	which	*T*-1	appears	on	the	balance	sheet	.
The	FASB	rule	will	cover	such	financial	instruments	as	interest	rate	swaps	,	financial	guarantees	,	foward	interest	rate	contracts	,	loan	contracts	,	loan	commitments	and	options	written	*	on	securites	held	*	.
It	will	require	companies	to	spell	out	in	more	detail	collateral	polices	and	concentrations	of	credit	risk	for	all	financial	instruments	.
The	rule	will	require	companies	with	financial	instruments	that	*T*-1	have	off-balance	sheet	risks	to	disclose	data	about	the	value	and	terms	of	the	instruments	,	any	accounting	loss	that	*T*-2	would	occur	if	the	outside	party	involved	*	in	the	instrument	failed	*-3	to	perform	,	and	the	company	's	policy	for	*	requiring	collateral	or	other	security	for	the	instrument	.
Scott	Miller	,	an	FASB	project	manager	,	said	that	a	final	rule	will	be	issued	*-1	before	year	end	.
But	he	noted	that	the	initial	effective	date	of	the	earlier	proposal	had	been	delayed	*-1	by	six	months	.
Poughkeepsie	Savings	Bank	said	0	a	plan	*	to	sell	its	South	Carolina	branch	offices	to	First	Citizens	Bank	,	of	Columbia	,	S.C.	,	fell	through	.
Poughkeepsie	also	expects	*-1	to	post	a	one-time	charge	of	$	8.3	million	*U*	,	*	resulting	in	a	net	loss	for	the	third	quarter	.
The	charge	represents	a	write-down	of	the	goodwill	associated	*	with	Poughkeepsie	's	investment	in	the	banks	0	it	is	trying	*-1	to	sell	*T*-2	and	its	North	Carolina	branches	as	well	.
The	thrift	announced	the	plan	Aug.	21	.
Among	other	reasons	,	high	fees	0	regulators	imposed	*T*-1	on	certain	transfers	of	thrift	deposits	to	commercial	banks	``	substantially	altered	the	economics	of	the	transaction	for	both	parties	,	''	Poughkeepsie	said	0	*T*-2	.
Additionally	,	the	bank	is	increasing	its	loan-loss	reserves	for	the	third	quarter	by	$	8.5	million	*U*	before	taxes	.
In	the	year-earlier	third	quarter	,	Poughkeepsie	Savings	had	net	income	of	$	2.8	million	*U*	,	or	77	cents	a	share	.
Poughkeepsie	said	0	it	is	continuing	*-1	to	try	*-2	to	sell	itself	,	under	a	June	agreement	with	a	dissident-shareholder	group	.
The	bank	also	said	0	its	effort	would	continue	past	the	Nov.	1	deadline	set	*	in	that	agreement	and	that	the	litigation	between	the	two	sides	might	resume	as	a	result	.
The	thrift	and	the	holders	had	suspended	their	lawsuits	as	part	of	the	agreement	.
Joe	Frank	Sanderson	Jr.	was	elected	*-1	president	and	chief	executive	officer	of	this	poultry	producer	.
Joe	Frank	Sanderson	,	who	*T*-1	is	currently	chairman	,	chief	executive	and	treasurer	,	will	remain	chairman	.
The	current	president	and	chief	operating	officer	,	J.	Odell	Johnson	,	was	elected	*-1	to	the	new	position	of	vice	chairman	of	the	board	.
Kinder-Care	Inc.	was	dropped	*-1	from	the	consumer	services	industry	group	of	the	Dow	Jones	Equity	Market	index	because	the	company	split	itself	in	a	restructuring	.
It	was	succeeded	*-1	in	the	group	by	Fuqua	Industries	Inc	.
Both	moves	are	effective	today	.
A	potentially	safer	whooping	cough	vaccine	made	*	by	novel	genetic	engineering	techniques	was	described	*-1	by	a	team	of	Italian	,	U.S.	and	Japanese	scientists	.
The	team	reported	0	they	managed	*-2	to	induce	bacteria	to	produce	a	non-toxic	version	of	the	poisons	produced	*	by	the	bacterium	that	*T*-1	causes	whooping	cough	.
Laboratory	tests	showed	that	non-toxic	versions	of	the	poisons	are	capable	of	*-2	inducing	an	immunity	to	whooping	cough	,	the	researchers	reported	0	*T*-1	in	this	week	's	issue	of	the	journal	Science	.
The	current	vaccine	for	whooping	cough	,	or	pertussis	,	is	part	of	the	``	DPT	''	-LRB-	for	diphtheria	,	pertussis	,	tetanus	-RRB-	shot	given	most	infants	and	young	children	*	.
The	vaccine	is	effective	in	*	preventing	a	disease	that	*T*-1	still	afflicts	about	60	million	children	a	year	world-wide	,	*-2	causing	an	estimated	one	million	deaths	.
The	vaccine	,	however	,	causes	allergic	reactions	that	*T*-1	can	be	fatal	.
The	reactions	stem	from	the	fact	that	the	vaccine	contains	multiple	copies	of	the	whole	Bordetella	pertussis	bacterium	,	which	*T*-1	causes	whooping	cough	.
This	bacterium	produces	a	toxin	that	,	if	*-2	used	*-3	as	a	vaccine	,	*T*-1	can	induce	immunity	to	whooping	cough	.
Unfortunately	,	the	toxin	is	also	poisonous	.
The	Italian-led	scientific	team	said	0	they	had	succeeded	in	*	getting	bacteria	to	produce	a	non-toxic	version	of	the	pertussis	toxin	,	which	*T*-2	could	be	used	*-1	as	a	safe	vaccine	.
The	researchers	reported	0	they	have	been	able	*-2	to	pluck	the	five	genes	that	*T*-1	produced	the	toxin	out	of	the	pertussis	bacterium	.
It	turned	out	that	although	it	*EXP*-1	took	all	five	genes	*	to	produce	the	toxin	,	only	one	was	responsible	for	the	toxin	's	virulence	.
Ordinarily	in	genetic	engineering	each	of	these	genes	,	minus	the	one	that	*T*-1	caused	the	virulence	,	would	have	been	transferred	*-3	to	another	bacterium	,	called	*	E.	coli	,	which	*T*-2	would	then	produce	a	nonvirulent	version	of	the	toxin	.
The	researchers	said	0	they	did	this	,	but	the	toxin	did	n't	induce	immunity	to	whooping	cough	.
The	scientists	then	took	the	five	toxin	genes	and	triggered	a	mutation	in	the	one	gene	that	*T*-1	caused	virulence	.
Then	,	*-1	using	a	new	technique	-LRB-	called	*	homologous	recombination	-RRB-	for	*	introducing	genes	into	cells	,	they	transferred	all	five	genes	to	bacteria	closely	related	to	the	pertussis	organism	.
These	bacterial	``	cousins	''	ordinarily	do	n't	make	the	toxin	.
But	the	genes	were	accompanied	*-1	by	a	piece	of	DNA	,	called	*	a	promoter	,	that	*T*-2	turns	the	genes	on	.
The	new	bacteria	recipients	of	the	genes	began	*-1	producing	pertussis	toxin	which	,	because	of	the	mutant	virulence	gene	,	*T*-2	was	no	longer	toxic	.
Experiments	showed	that	the	new	,	non-virulent	toxin	is	capable	of	*	inducing	immunity	,	according	to	the	researchers	from	the	Selavo	Research	Center	in	Siena	,	Italy	,	the	Medical	College	of	Wisconsin	in	Milwaukee	and	the	Japanese	National	Institutes	of	Health	.
Carl	E.	Pissocra	,	president	and	chief	executive	officer	of	Bank	One	,	Dover	,	has	been	named	*-1	regional	president	,	a	new	post	at	the	bank-holding	company	.
Mr.	Pissocra	,	56	years	old	,	will	be	responsible	for	the	company	's	10	banks	in	the	Eastern	region	.
Dan	J.	Hartwell	,	41	,	executive	vice	president	of	Bank	One	,	Dover	,	was	named	*-1	president	and	chief	executive	of	the	Dover	bank	,	*-1	succeeding	Mr.	Pissocra	.
No	one	was	named	*-1	*-2	to	succeed	Mr.	Hartwell	.
At	a	time	when	foreign	banks	are	pouring	vast	resources	and	personnel	into	West	Germany	's	financial	center	*T*-1	,	the	opening	of	a	three-man	office	on	a	Frankfurt	side	street	should	n't	attract	much	attention	.
Unless	,	of	course	,	it	happens	*-2	to	be	run	*-1	by	the	Rothschilds	.
After	an	88-year	absence	from	the	birthplace	of	the	family	banking	empire	,	the	return	of	the	Rothschild	group	to	Frankfurt	was	greeted	*-1	by	the	glare	of	television	lights	,	curious	reporters	and	a	mayoral	reception	in	Town	Hall	.
Like	other	foreign	banks	establishing	a	presence	here	,	the	family	describes	its	move	as	a	calculated	decision	*	to	set	up	a	financial	services	outlet	in	Europe	's	largest	economy	ahead	of	the	integration	of	European	Community	markets	after	1992	.
Yet	the	Rothschilds	do	n't	deny	an	emotional	element	to	the	decision	.
In	1796	,	Mayer	Amschel	Rothschild	founded	Bankhaus	M.A.	Rothschild	&	Sons	and	later	sent	his	four	sons	to	London	,	Paris	,	Vienna	and	Naples	*-1	to	begin	the	bank	's	expansion	during	the	early	19th	century	.
The	original	bank	in	Frankfurt	closed	in	1901	after	the	death	of	Wilhelm	Carl	von	Rothschild	,	and	the	family	's	banking	activities	focused	on	London	and	Paris	.
Baron	Elie	de	Rothschild	,	the	family	's	elder	spokesman	,	explains	that	by	the	end	of	the	19th	century	,	Berlin	had	replaced	Frankfurt	as	Germany	's	financial	center	.
Yet	the	chief	reason	for	the	closure	,	he	says	0	*T*-3	,	was	rooted	in	a	family	tradition	that	*T*-2	would	n't	allow	a	bank	to	bear	the	Rothschild	name	without	a	Rothschild	in	its	management	.
``	At	the	time	we	had	only	daughters	,	''	explains	*T*-1	the	72-year-old	patriarch	,	``	so	we	had	*-2	to	close	the	bank	.	''
Much	of	the	family	's	mystique	remained	.
Although	its	palatial	residence	was	destroyed	*-1	by	bombs	during	World	War	II	,	the	Rothschilds	'	place	in	Frankfurt	's	history	is	still	recalled	*-2	by	the	city	park	and	a	street	bearing	the	Rothschild	name	.
The	family	's	long	absence	is	understandable	.
The	family	was	in	Allied	countries	during	both	World	War	I	and	the	long	period	of	economic	strife	of	the	1920s	.
During	the	Third	Reich	,	the	Rothschilds	were	a	target	of	Nazi	propaganda	against	Jewish	financiers	.
The	persecution	pursued	the	Rothschilds	across	Europe	as	the	Nazis	grabbed	countries	,	*-1	confiscating	the	family	's	property	in	the	process	.
American	journalist	William	L.	Shirer	,	in	his	book	``	The	Rise	and	Fall	of	the	Third	Reich	,	''	wrote	of	how	in	Vienna	he	had	witnessed	``	squads	of	-LCB-	Nazi	-RCB-	SS	men	carting	off	silver	,	tapestries	,	paintings	and	other	loot	from	the	Rothschild	palace	*T*-2	.	''
In	the	immediate	postwar	years	,	the	Rothschilds	concentrated	on	*	rebuilding	their	other	European	operations	,	*-1	delaying	their	return	to	Frankfurt	.
``	For	a	member	of	the	Rothschild	family	,	the	return	to	Frankfurt	is	a	very	meaningful	event	,	although	it	might	not	mean	as	much	to	German	banking	as	it	means	to	us	,	''	says	*T*-1	Baron	David	de	Rothschild	,	Elie	's	younger	cousin	and	a	partner	in	Rothschild	&	Cie	.	Banque	in	Paris	.
Indeed	,	the	competition	is	n't	greatly	concerned	.
``	It	*ICH*-1	would	be	surprising	if	they	did	n't	come	to	Frankfurt	in	time	for	1992	,	and	they	bring	an	interesting	tradition	.
But	the	market	really	is	n't	going	*-2	to	be	stood	*-1	on	its	head	,	''	said	*T*-3	a	banker	at	one	of	Frankfurt	's	Big	Three	banks	.
The	return	of	the	Rothschilds	is	modest	.
The	new	representative	office	,	with	one	manager	and	two	assistants	--	none	a	member	of	the	Rothschild	family	--	will	carry	out	no	banking	operations	of	its	own	.
Instead	,	it	is	*-1	to	seek	out	corporate	financing	business	and	sell	investment	products	on	behalf	of	the	family	's	mainstay	banking	units	:	N	M	Rothschild	&	Sons	Ltd.	in	London	,	Rothschild	&	Cie.	in	Paris	and	Rothschild	Bank	AG	in	Zurich	.
The	constraints	do	n't	bother	the	office	's	54-year-old	manager	,	Erich	Stromeyer	.
He	left	his	job	as	general	manager	of	Shearson	Lehman	Hutton	Holdings	Inc.	's	Frankfurt	office	because	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	,	``	When	the	Rothschilds	called	*T*-2	,	I	could	n't	resist	.	''
Each	Rothschild	bank	is	linked	*-1	by	family	ties	and	cross-ownership	.
In	March	,	N	M	Rothschild	in	London	and	Rothschild	Bank	in	Zurich	showed	assets	of	#	4.1	billion	*U*	-LRB-	$	6.51	billion	*U*	-RRB-	and	1.26	billion	Swiss	francs	-LRB-	$	774	million	*U*	-RRB-	,	respectively	.
The	Paris	bank	does	n't	publish	that	figure	.
In	Europe	,	the	Rothschilds	banks	are	focusing	on	mergers	and	acquisitions	as	European	industry	restructures	ahead	of	1992	.
Yet	the	group	's	limited	resources	makes	it	a	niche	player	.
``	Obviously	,	there	are	quantitative	limitations	on	the	assistance	0	we	can	provide	*T*-1	,	''	concedes	*T*-2	Baron	David	de	Rothschild	,	``	but	we	feel	0	we	have	some	cards	0	*	to	play	*T*-3	.	''
Among	them	,	he	says	0	*T*-2	,	is	*T*-1	the	family	's	traditional	ties	to	old	wealth	and	decision-makers	in	banking	and	industry	throughout	Europe	and	beyond	.
The	Rothschilds	hope	*-1	to	use	a	long	history	in	private	banking	and	an	aura	of	exclusivity	*-2	to	attract	private	and	institutional	investors	.
As	at	the	Zurich	bank	,	the	minimum	investment	for	individuals	*ICH*-2	will	be	high	:	about	a	million	German	marks	-LRB-	$	538,000	*U*	-RRB-	,	three	times	what	many	other	West	German	investment	banks	require	*T*-1	.
``	But	we	do	make	exceptions	,	''	says	*T*-1	a	smiling	Baron	Elie	de	Rothschild	,	``	especially	if	they	are	very	young	and	have	very	rich	parents	.
As	program	trading	comes	under	renewed	attack	for	*	causing	stock	market	gyrations	,	a	few	people	on	Wall	Street	say	0	it	is	time	0	*	to	consider	extreme	measures	*T*-1	.
The	real	answer	to	*	curbing	wild	swings	in	stock	prices	,	they	say	0	*T*-2	,	might	be	*	to	curb	*RNR*-1	or	even	abolish	*RNR*-1	stock-index	futures	.
A	stock-index	future	is	a	contract	*	to	buy	or	sell	the	market	value	of	a	basket	of	stocks	,	such	as	the	Standard	&	Poor	's	500-stock	index	.
Since	stock	futures	were	created	*-1	in	1982	,	*	trading	on	the	Chicago	Mercantile	Exchange	and	other	exchanges	has	boomed	to	the	point	where	*	trading	in	stock-index	futures	rivals	that	in	the	stocks	themselves	.
The	conventional	view	,	as	*	voiced	*-1	by	Goldman	,	Sachs	&	Co.	partner	Fischer	Black	,	is	that	stocks	and	``	derivatives	''	such	as	futures	and	options	``	form	a	single	market	,	and	that	derivatives	make	it	a	more	liquid	market	.	''
But	increasingly	,	people	are	questioning	that	view	,	and	the	critics	include	some	of	the	country	's	most	successful	investors	.
Warren	Buffett	has	been	on	record	as	*	opposing	stock-index	futures	since	their	inception	in	1982	.
And	Mario	Gabelli	,	another	star	in	the	investing	world	,	says	,	``	My	gut	says	0	the	negatives	of	futures	and	synthetics	far	outweigh	the	benefits	.	''
Like	others	,	Mr.	Gabelli	says	that	if	futures	cause	investors	to	lose	confidence	in	stocks	,	they	will	move	away	from	stocks	--	as	many	have	already	done	.
And	those	who	*T*-1	remain	,	he	says	0	*T*-2	``	will	demand	a	higher	return	and	over	time	raise	the	cost	of	capital	to	companies	.	''
Essentially	,	the	critics	of	stock-index	futures	fall	into	two	camps	.
One	group	says	0	the	futures	contribute	to	stock	market	volatility	;	the	other	contends	that	futures	are	a	sideshow	of	speculation	that	*T*-1	detracts	from	the	stock	market	's	basic	function	of	*	raising	capital	.
``	Before	futures	,	''	says	*T*-1	New	York	investor	Michael	Harkins	,	``	you	actually	had	*-2	to	pay	attention	to	whether	the	thing	0	you	were	buying	*T*-3	had	any	intrinsic	value	.	''
While	it	was	once	expected	that	futures	would	mimic	stock	prices	,	traders	now	routinely	check	the	futures	markets	in	Chicago	before	they	buy	or	sell	stocks	.
When	Chicago	futures	prices	jump	up	or	down	*T*-1	,	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	follows	.
On	Tuesday	,	for	instance	,	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	plunged	80	points	in	little	more	than	an	hour	.
Then	,	in	the	space	of	a	20-minute	coffee	break	,	the	average	rallied	almost	all	of	the	way	back	.
Paul	Lesutis	,	who	*T*-1	manages	more	than	$	3	billion	*U*	of	investments	at	Provident	Capital	Management	Inc.	,	blames	futures	markets	for	*	leading	the	way	.
``	The	fundamentals	do	n't	change	in	an	hour	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	I	think	0	they	should	close	down	the	futures	exchange	and	then	we	could	get	back	to	investing	.	''
Index	arbitrage	--	the	rapid-fire	buying	and	selling	of	stocks	offset	*	with	opposite	trades	in	futures	--	is	frequently	blamed	*-1	for	*-2	adding	to	stock	market	volatility	.
Although	index	arbitrage	is	said	*-1	to	add	liquidity	to	markets	,	John	Bachmann	,	managing	partner	of	Edward	D.	Jones	,	says	0	too	much	liquidity	is	n't	a	good	thing
``	The	kind	of	instant	liquidity	that	*T*-2	is	implied	*-1	by	index	futures	is	that	you	can	buy	a	portfolio	over	two	years	and	get	out	in	one	day	.
It	's	too	disruptive	,	''	he	says	*T*-1	.
``	It	is	n't	investing	.	''
But	stock-index	futures	have	plenty	of	support	.
Defenders	say	0	futures	make	markets	more	efficient	and	provide	ways	0	for	investors	to	reduce	risks	*T*-1	.
They	note	that	stocks	experienced	volatile	swings	long	before	futures	.
And	,	defenders	say	0	*T*-1	,	few	people	complain	about	futures	when	stock	prices	are	rising	*T*-2	.
Louis	Margolis	,	managing	director	in	charge	of	equity	options	and	futures	at	Salomon	Inc.	,	says	that	*	trading	baskets	of	stocks	began	in	the	1970s	,	a	decade	before	the	advent	of	futures	.
Futures	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	,	merely	cut	down	on	trading	costs	.
He	says	``	*	blaming	futures	is	like	*	blaming	the	messenger	.	''
Since	stock-index	arbitrage	merely	narrows	the	gap	between	prices	in	the	futures	and	stock	markets	,	it	ca	n't	add	to	volatility	,	he	says	0	*T*-1	.
Futures	``	do	n't	need	defending	,	''	says	*T*-2	Andrew	Yemma	,	a	spokesman	for	the	Chicago	Mercantile	Exchange	,	which	*T*-1	trades	the	S&P	500	,	by	far	the	largest	stock-index	futures	contract	.
Despite	the	current	outcry	over	stock	market	volatility	,	few	people	expect	stock	futures	to	disappear	.
For	one	thing	,	the	Chicago	futures	exchanges	have	political	and	financial	clout	--	including	many	friends	in	Congress	.
And	traders	say	that	futures	have	become	an	accepted	part	of	the	financial	landscape	.
``	All	life	is	about	change	--	either	you	adapt	or	*-1	die	,	''	says	*T*-2	one	Chicago	futures	trader	.
``	If	futures	are	n't	permitted	*-1	here	,	we	'll	take	it	to	Australia	or	Tokyo	.	''
Average	daily	volume	in	S&P	500	futures	last	year	was	44,877	contracts	.
*-2	Based	*-1	on	yesterday	's	closing	price	of	the	S&P	,	the	average	value	of	one	day	's	trading	amounts	to	$	7.6	billion	*U*	.
By	contrast	,	average	dollar	volume	on	the	Big	Board	last	year	was	$	5.3	billion	*U*	.
Many	investment	managers	say	0	futures	are	useful	as	a	way	0	*	to	hedge	portfolios	*T*-1	.
If	managers	fear	that	the	overall	stock	market	will	fall	,	but	want	*-1	to	continue	*-2	owning	stocks	,	they	can	hold	on	to	specific	stocks	and	sell	a	corresponding	amount	of	futures	contracts	.

And	although	criticism	of	futures	generally	comes	from	Wall	Street	,	one	Chicago	futures	trader	notes	that	brokerage	firms	rely	on	futures	as	hedging	tools	when	they	buy	and	sell	big	blocks	of	stocks	from	institutions	*T*-1	.
One	reason	0	futures	are	said	*-1	to	add	volatility	*T*-2	is	that	--	unlike	in	stocks	--	people	can	speculate	in	futures	with	little	money	down	.
Margin	requirements	for	speculators	on	the	Chicago	Mercantile	Exchange	are	currently	about	7	%	.
``	For	$	10	million	*U*	,	you	can	move	$	100	million	*U*	of	stocks	,	''	a	specialist	on	the	Big	Board	gripes	*T*-1	.
``	That	gives	futures	traders	a	lot	more	power	.	''
By	contrast	,	an	investor	in	stocks	must	put	up	50	%	in	cash	.
Some	critics	say	0	futures	encourage	people	to	think	of	stocks	as	a	single	commodity	,	rather	than	as	investments	in	individual	businesses	.
Thus	,	they	say	0	*T*-1	,	futures	inhibit	the	basic	purpose	of	the	stock	market	:	*	to	accurately	price	securities	so	that	capital	and	investment	flows	where	it	's	needed	most	*T*-3	.
The	S&P	500	index	futures	``	transferred	the	identity	of	500	stocks	into	one	unit	-	*-1	making	them	a	simple	commodity	0	*	to	trade	*T*-2	,	''	says	*T*-3	George	Kegler	,	senior	vice	president	at	A.	Webster	Dougherty	in	Philadelphia	.
``	It	took	away	the	need	*	to	know	the	bad	third-quarter	report	of	IBM	,	for	example	,	''	Mr.	Kegler	says	*T*-2	.
Of	course	,	portfolio	trading	--	the	increasingly	common	practice	of	*	buying	or	selling	baskets	of	actual	stocks	--	also	treats	stocks	as	homogenous	commodities	.
``	There	is	a	class	of	investor	that	*T*-2	wants	*-3	to	be	exposed	*-1	''	to	the	whole	market	,	says	*T*-4	Sandip	Bhagat	,	assistant	vice	president	at	Travelers	Investment	Management	Co	.
The	S&P	futures	are	merely	a	``	cheaper	and	quicker	''	way	0	*	to	get	access	to	all	500	stocks	*T*-1	,	he	says	0	*T*-2	.
The	Big	Board	yesterday	began	*-1	trading	in	its	own	basket	trading	vehicle	representing	the	S&P	500	stocks	.
But	*	owning	index	futures	is	n't	the	same	as	*	owning	the	underlying	stocks	.
Stockholders	,	as	a	group	,	can	win	,	because	they	own	a	share	of	corporate	earnings	,	which	*T*-1	can	grow	and	boost	stock	prices	.
Futures	,	on	the	other	hand	,	are	a	zero	sum	game	--	a	market	for	*	making	side	bets	about	the	direction	of	stock	prices	.
``	You	do	n't	own	anything	,	''	says	*T*-1	Stephen	Boesel	,	a	money	manager	for	T.	Rowe	Price	in	Baltimore	.

The	European	Community	Commission	challenged	an	agreement	on	routes	and	fares	between	France	's	two	largest	airlines	on	antitrust	grounds	.
*-1	Meeting	in	Strasbourg	Wednesday	,	the	commission	voted	,	as	*	expected	,	*-1	to	formally	object	to	the	accord	between	Air	France	,	the	state-owned	airline	,	and	state-controlled	domestic	carrier	Air	Inter	.
An	EC	spokesman	said	0	the	two	companies	will	be	notified	*-1	so	they	can	begin	negotiations	with	Brussels	on	how	*	to	modify	the	pact	*T*-2	.
At	issue	is	*T*-1	an	accord	dating	back	to	March	in	which	Air	France	gained	access	to	five	domestic	French	routes	under	Air	Inter	's	flight	numbers	and	the	domestic	airline	got	*-2	to	fly	to	five	cities	outside	of	France	under	the	flag	of	Air	France	*T*-3	.
The	two	shared	results	from	this	route	swap	,	and	followed	rules	on	ticket	pricing	.
The	EC	Commission	decided	that	such	an	accord	does	n't	benefit	consumers	enough	*-1	to	merit	an	exemption	from	antitrust	law	.
The	airlines	presented	it	as	*	offering	consumers	more	choice	and	better	flight	connections	.
An	Air	France	spokeswoman	said	,	``	we	're	absolutely	ready	*-1	to	study	all	solutions	.	''
An	Air	Inter	spokesman	said	,	``	Because	they	-LCB-	the	EC	-RCB-	have	doubts	,	we	will	work	again	on	the	text	and	the	contents	of	the	accord	.
A	state	appellate	court	reinstated	the	1987	convictions	of	Pymm	Thermometer	Corp.	and	two	of	its	executives	on	charges	of	assault	for	*	exposing	workers	to	toxic	mercury	vapors	.
The	indictment	charged	that	Pymm	operated	a	machine	0	*T*-1	to	crush	broken	thermometers	and	recover	the	mercury	in	an	illegal	workroom	.
The	charges	said	that	one	worker	suffered	permanent	brain	damage	from	mercury	exposure	.
The	judge	handling	the	case	in	state	Supreme	Court	,	a	trial	court	,	had	tossed	out	the	jury	verdicts	,	*-2	ruling	that	the	matter	should	have	been	handled	*-3	under	federal	Occupational	Safety	and	Health	Administration	rules	.
But	the	Appellate	Division	of	State	Supreme	Court	held	0	that	federal	law	did	n't	pre-empt	the	states	from	such	a	prosecution	.
Elizabeth	Holtzman	,	district	attorney	for	Brooklyn	,	N.Y.	,	said	,	``	The	appellate	division	has	agreed	with	our	view	that	despite	federal	worker-safety	laws	,	state	prosecutors	have	the	power	*	to	protect	working	people	.	''
Lawyers	for	the	company	and	executives	could	n't	be	reached	*-1	for	comment	.
The	executives	face	five	to	15	years	in	prison	and	fines	of	$	5,000	*U*	or	double	the	profit	made	*	by	*	failing	*-1	to	comply	with	the	rules	.
The	company	could	be	fined	*-1	a	maximum	of	$	10,000	*U*	,	or	double	the	profit	.
General	Motors	Corp.	wants	*-1	to	buy	as	much	as	15	%	of	Jaguar	PLC	,	*-2	marking	its	first	salvo	in	a	possible	full-scale	battle	against	Ford	Motor	Co.	for	control	of	the	British	car	maker	.
GM	sought	U.S.	antitrust	clearance	*ICH*-1	last	week	*	to	purchase	more	than	$	15	million	*U*	worth	of	Jaguar	shares	but	does	n't	own	any	yet	,	according	to	GM	officials	here	and	at	the	company	's	Detroit	headquarters	.
The	No.	1	U.S.	auto	maker	then	wrote	Jaguar	that	it	intends	``	*-1	to	go	to	that	15	%	''	level	once	it	wins	the	U.S.	clearance	*	to	go	beyond	$	15	million	*U*	,	a	Jaguar	spokesman	said	0	*T*-2	yesterday	.
The	GM	move	follows	Tuesday	's	declaration	by	Ford	,	which	*T*-1	holds	an	unwelcome	12.45	%	stake	in	Jaguar	,	that	it	is	prepared	*-2	to	bid	for	the	entire	company	.
GM	is	close	to	*	completing	a	friendly	deal	with	Jaguar	that	*T*-1	is	likely	*-2	to	involve	an	eventual	30	%	stake	and	joint	manufacturing	ventures	.
Speculative	investors	,	*-1	betting	on	an	imminent	clash	between	Ford	and	GM	,	pushed	up	Jaguar	's	share	price	five	pence	-LRB-	eight	U.S.	cents	-RRB-	to	a	near-record	720	pence	-LRB-	$	11.60	*U*	-RRB-	in	late	trading	on	London	's	stock	exchange	yesterday	.
Since	Tuesday	,	the	shares	have	gained	nearly	4	%	.
But	an	all-out	bidding	war	between	the	world	's	top	auto	giants	for	Britain	's	leading	luxury-car	maker	seems	unlikely	.
``	We	will	not	go	over	a	certain	level	,	''	said	*T*-1	*ICH*-2	*ICH*-3	David	N.	McCammon	,	Ford	's	vice	president	for	finance	,	at	a	news	conference	yesterday	in	Dearborn	,	Mich	.
``	There	's	some	price	at	which	we	'd	stop	*-2	bidding	*T*-1	.	''
He	would	n't	specify	what	it	was	*T*-1	.
And	powerful	political	pressures	may	convince	the	Conservative	government	to	keep	its	so-called	golden	share	,	which	*T*-1	limits	any	individual	holding	to	15	%	,	until	the	restriction	expires	on	Dec.	31	,	1990	.
``	I	really	do	n't	see	the	government	doing	something	that	Jaguar	does	n't	want	*T*-1	over	the	next	14	months	,	''	said	*T*-2	Kenneth	Warren	,	a	Conservative	member	of	Parliament	and	chairman	of	the	Select	Committee	on	Trade	and	Industry	in	Britain	's	House	of	Commons	.
``	The	golden	share	is	a	single	share	,	but	it	is	the	magic	share	.	''
The	government	retained	the	single	share	after	*	selling	its	stake	in	Jaguar	in	1984	--	part	of	a	nationalistic	practice	of	*	protecting	former	government-owned	enterprises	*-1	to	deflect	criticism	of	privatization	.
The	15	%	restriction	covers	any	would-be	suitor	,	British	or	foreign	.
Ford	is	willing	*-1	to	bid	for	100	%	of	Jaguar	's	shares	if	both	the	government	and	Jaguar	shareholders	agree	*-2	to	relax	the	anti-takeover	barrier	prematurely	.
*-2	As	Jaguar	's	biggest	holder	and	Britain	's	biggest	car	maker	,	Ford	could	turn	up	the	heat	by	*	convening	a	special	shareholders	'	meeting	and	urging	holders	*-1	to	drop	the	limits	early	.
Ford	might	succeed	because	many	shareholders	are	speculators	keen	for	a	full	bid	or	institutional	investors	unhappy	over	Jaguar	management	's	handling	of	its	current	financial	difficulties	.
The	government	probably	would	n't	give	in	readily	to	a	hostile	foray	by	Ford	,	however	.
It	has	relinquished	a	golden	share	only	once	before	--	during	British	Petroleum	Co.	's	#	2.5	billion	*U*	-LRB-	$	4	billion	*U*	-RRB-	takeover	of	Britoil	PLC	in	1988	.
*-1	In	*	wooing	British	lawmakers	,	GM	has	pointed	out	that	its	willingness	*	to	settle	for	a	minority	stake	would	keep	Jaguar	British-owned	and	independent	.
This	week	,	the	U.S.	auto	giant	paid	for	10	House	of	Commons	members	and	two	House	of	Lords	members	to	fly	to	Detroit	and	tour	its	operations	there	.
While	the	visit	was	unrelated	to	Jaguar	,	GM	Chairman	Roger	Smith	answered	the	legislators	'	questions	about	it	over	lunch	Tuesday	.
He	said	0	Jaguar	``	should	n't	be	smothered	*-1	by	anyone	else	,	''	recalled	0	*T*-2	one	participant	.
Politics	also	influences	the	government	's	thinking	on	the	anti-takeover	restriction	.
The	Conservatives	do	n't	dare	*-1	jeopardize	marginal	Tory	seats	in	Coventry	,	where	Jaguar	has	headquarters	*T*-2	,	nor	can	the	government	easily	back	down	on	promised	protection	for	a	privatized	company	while	it	proceeds	with	controversial	plans	*	to	privatize	most	of	Britain	's	water	and	electricity	industries	.
Prime	Minister	Margaret	Thatcher	might	,	however	,	be	receptive	to	any	request	by	Jaguar	Chairman	Sir	John	Egan	for	the	restriction	's	early	removal	*	to	let	GM	amass	more	than	15	%	or	mount	a	friendly	suitor	bid	against	Ford	.
In	the	end	,	Sir	John	--	rather	than	the	government	or	Jaguar	shareholders	--	may	hold	the	key	that	*T*-1	unlocks	the	golden	share	.
Swedish	rolling-steel	and	ball-bearing	group	AB	SKF	said	0	its	pretax	profit	rose	78	%	to	1.78	billion	kronor	-LRB-	$	278	million	*U*	-RRB-	in	the	first	nine	months	from	one	billion	kronor	-LRB-	$	156	million	*U*	-RRB-	in	the	corresponding	period	a	year	earlier	.

We	read	with	interest	Robert	Tomsho	's	Sept.	28	page-one	article	on	Robert	Redford	-LRB-	``	The	Sundance	Kid	Gets	Little	Respect	Around	Sundance	''	-RRB-	.
*-1	Misunderstanding	conversations	with	us	,	Mr.	Tomsho	argued	that	Mr.	Redford	's	environmental	views	are	at	odds	with	Utah	residents	.
This	may	have	been	true	10	years	ago	,	but	times	have	changed	,	even	in	Utah	.
Mr.	Redford	no	longer	stands	out	as	an	extremist	.
He	has	not	changed	,	but	those	around	him	have	*?*	.
Many	of	his	views	on	the	protection	of	wilderness	areas	,	rivers	and	canyons	are	now	embraced	*-1	by	mainstream	,	conservative	Utahans	.
Recently	,	some	60	environmental	and	outdoor	groups	representing	such	divergent	points	of	view	as	the	Sierra	Club	,	the	League	of	Women	Voters	and	the	National	Rifle	Association	joined	together	*-1	to	request	a	reassessment	of	the	environmentally	unsound	Central	Utah	Project	.
While	Utah	is	not	yet	a	haven	for	environmentalism	,	public	views	toward	the	environment	have	significantly	improved	.
In	one	of	the	most	conservative	,	Republican	states	in	the	entire	nation	,	the	greening	of	Robert	Redford	's	neighbors	is	the	real	story	that	Mr.	Tomsho	missed	*T*-1	.

If	Mr.	Redford	wanted	*-2	to	be	accepted	*-1	by	the	people	of	Utah	,	he	should	have	taken	an	advisory	role	instead	of	one	of	*-3	forcing	his	personal	preferences	.
Furthermore	,	his	actions	imply	that	it	is	too	damaging	or	costly	for	society	to	provide	jobs	through	power-plant	construction	,	coal	mining	or	to	build	roads	for	public	safety	because	of	the	adverse	impact	on	the	environment	,	but	it	is	just	fine	and	dandy	for	him	to	transform	a	mountain	high	in	the	Wasatch	Range	into	a	ski	resort	.
It	*EXP*-1	astounds	me	0	he	can	rationalize	his	self-righteous	and	greedy	actions	in	Utah	.

Mr.	Redford	,	*	like	it	or	not	,	is	like	a	braking	system	on	a	runaway	truck	,	kind	of	*-1	slowing	it	down	into	control	.

When	President	Bush	travels	to	Costa	Rica	today	*T*-2	,	he	'll	go	with	little	of	the	fanfare	that	*T*-1	accompanies	many	of	his	foreign	travels	.
But	the	two-day	trip	still	has	managed	*-1	to	fuel	controversy	over	his	administration	's	policies	in	Central	America	.
Some	conservatives	say	0	Mr.	Bush	should	n't	make	the	trip	,	during	which	he	will	participate	in	Costa	Rica	's	celebration	of	100	years	of	democracy	*T*-1	.
These	critics	object	to	Mr.	Bush	's	participation	in	a	meeting	that	*T*-1	includes	Nicaraguan	President	Daniel	Ortega	among	the	guests	.
In	addition	,	they	argue	0	he	wo	n't	help	Washington	's	standing	in	the	region	by	*	trumpeting	the	U.S.	commitment	to	democracy	less	than	a	month	after	his	administration	played	an	ineffectual	role	in	the	failed	coup	attempt	in	Panama	.
``	I	believe	0	it	will	do	more	damage	than	good	because	it	will	legitimize	people	like	Daniel	Ortega	,	''	says	*T*-2	Curtin	Windsor	,	who	*T*-1	served	as	U.S.	ambassador	to	Costa	Rica	during	the	Reagan	administration	.
Mr.	Windsor	,	among	other	analysts	connected	*	to	the	conservative	Heritage	Foundation	,	fears	0	the	gathering	of	18	leaders	,	mostly	from	Central	American	nations	,	will	force	Mr.	Bush	``	to	explain	and	redeem	himself	''	in	the	wake	of	charges	that	the	U.S.	failed	*-1	to	do	enough	*-2	to	aid	the	removal	of	Panamanian	dictator	Manuel	Noriega	.
At	the	same	time	,	liberal	and	moderate	Democrats	note	the	irony	of	Mr.	Bush	's	joining	a	celebration	of	Costa	Rican	democracy	at	a	time	0	his	administration	has	sought	sharp	cuts	in	U.S.	aid	to	the	tiny	country	*T*-1	.
The	administration	proposed	only	$	57	million	*U*	in	so-called	economic	support	funds	for	Costa	Rica	this	year	,	down	from	the	$	90	million	*U*	0	the	U.S.	provided	*T*-1	last	year	.
The	administration	said	0	improvements	in	Costa	Rica	's	economic	condition	warrant	the	cut	in	aid	,	which	the	country	uses	*T*-1	mainly	*-2	to	make	payments	on	its	$	4.5	billion	*U*	foreign	debt	.
But	Costa	Rican	officials	argue	that	the	recent	drop	in	coffee	prices	,	combined	*	with	the	country	's	continuing	struggle	*	to	reinvigorate	its	economy	,	make	the	support	as	necessary	as	ever	.
``	We	are	crossing	the	river	and	we	need	a	little	more	help	*-1	to	get	to	the	other	side	,	''	said	*T*-2	Rodrigo	Sotela	,	an	economic	affairs	specialist	at	the	Costa	Rican	Embassy	in	Washington	.
Democrats	argue	that	Costa	Rica	deserves	more	assistance	for	the	same	reason	that	Mr.	Bush	is	attending	the	celebration	this	weekend	:	*	to	reward	the	country	for	its	stability	in	a	region	wracked	*	with	turmoil	and	for	its	efforts	*	to	promote	peace	in	Nicaragua	.
However	,	peace	efforts	by	Costa	Rican	President	Oscar	Arias	have	n't	always	helped	the	country	's	cause	in	Washington	.
Mr.	Arias	's	long-time	refusal	*	to	support	the	U.S.	's	campaign	against	leftist	Nicaragua	earned	him	the	ire	of	the	Reagan	White	House	.
And	more	recently	,	he	insisted	on	*	signing	a	five-nation	agreement	intended	*	to	disarm	Nicaragua	's	U.S.-backed	Contra	rebels	faster	than	the	Bush	administration	would	prefer	*?*	.
``	I	think	0	Bush	's	going	there	is	a	helpful	sign	,	''	said	*T*-2	Sen.	Terry	Sanford	-LRB-	D.	,	N.C	.	-RRB-	a	member	of	the	Foreign	Relations	Committee	who	*T*-1	pushed	*	to	provide	Costa	Rica	about	the	same	amount	of	aid	as	it	received	*	last	year	.
Lawmakers	in	both	houses	support	the	higher	level	.
Administration	officials	defend	Mr.	Bush	's	decision	*	to	make	the	trip	.
While	they	acknowledge	0	the	president	will	attend	several	meals	and	a	working	session	also	attended	*	by	Mr.	Ortega	,	they	insist	that	Mr.	Bush	wo	n't	be	extending	the	Nicaraguan	leader	any	special	courtesies	.
The	administration	also	made	clear	its	continuing	distate	for	the	leftist	Nicaraguan	government	in	recent	days	,	*-2	endorsing	a	package	of	electoral	aid	to	the	Nicaraguan	opposition	,	renewing	the	U.S.	trade	embargo	against	the	country	and	continuing	*-1	to	complain	that	the	country	supports	rebel	groups	in	the	region	.
Officials	also	insist	0	Mr.	Bush	will	use	the	trip	*-1	to	highlight	his	own	initiatives	for	*	pushing	democracy	in	the	region	,	fighting	illegal	drugs	and	assisting	the	less	developed	countries	.
``	*	Let	me	say	0	there	is	a	symbolic	component	to	this	trip	,	''	Secretary	of	State	James	Baker	told	reporters	*T*-1	Wednesday	.
``	There	wo	n't	be	any	formal	resolutions	or	communiques	,	I	do	n't	think	0	*T*-1	.
But	we	still	see	this	as	an	opportunity	*	to	discuss	many	,	many	very	important	issues	.
In	1987	,	the	Presidents	Commission	of	the	NCAA	,	which	*T*-1	oversees	most	U.S.	intercollegiate	sports	,	contracted	with	the	Washington-based	American	Institutes	for	Research	*-3	to	do	a	survey	on	the	college	experiences	of	what	the	body	chooses	*-2	to	call	*T*-4	student-athletes	.
A	brief	``	executive	summary	''	was	issued	*-1	last	April	,	and	attracted	some	,	but	not	much	,	attention	.
More-detailed	reports	followed	,	and	attracted	even	less	notice	.
I	suspect	0	I	may	be	one	of	the	few	people	0	*T*-1	to	have	read	them	all	.
The	sixth	and	last	report	now	is	out	,	and	it	puts	the	effort	in	perspective	.
*-3	Titled	*-2	``	Comments	From	Students	,	''	it	focuses	on	the	real	shame	of	college	sports	:	what	*T*-1	happens	to	young	athletes	once	they	enter	academe	.
It	's	little	less	than	a	cry	for	help	from	those	who	*T*-1	make	the	costly	show	possible	.
The	previous	five	reports	were	mainly	statistical	,	but	clear	enough	in	outline	.
They	showed	that	participants	in	Division	I	football	and	men	's	basketball	,	the	big-time	``	revenue	sports	,	''	entered	school	with	poorer	high-school	grades	and	test	scores	than	``	minor-sport	''	jocks	and	students	who	*T*-1	participated	in	other	extracurricular	activities	,	and	they	got	lower	grades	once	they	got	there	,	at	least	partly	because	of	the	athletic	demands	placed	*	on	them	.
The	football	and	basketball	players	spent	more	time	on	their	sports	in	season	than	they	did	on	class	attendance	and	homework	combined	*	-LRB-	30	hours	a	week	versus	25.3	-RRB-	.
Almost	half	-LRB-	49.8	%	-RRB-	reported	*-1	suffering	``	mental	abuse	''	from	coaches	,	and	almost	one-quarter	-LRB-	24.8	%	-RRB-	said	0	they	had	been	pressured	*-2	to	ignore	injuries	.
But	even	those	numbers	do	n't	describe	the	situation	as	well	as	the	athletes	do	*?*	in	their	own	words	.
The	composite	portrait	that	*T*-1	emerges	is	n't	of	a	pampered	jock	marking	time	until	he	can	land	a	seven-figure	pro	contract	--	he	's	part	of	a	tiny	minority	.
Rather	,	it	's	of	a	kid	-LRB-	we	're	talking	about	17	to	22	year	olds	here	-RRB-	having	a	tough	time	*	making	the	best	of	what	*T*-1	will	probably	be	his	one	shot	at	college	.
The	pertinent	question	,	coming	at	the	end	of	a	lengthy	,	confidential	questionnaire	,	was	this	:	``	Are	there	things	about	your	college	life	0	you	would	like	*-1	to	tell	us	*T*-2	that	we	did	n't	ask	about	*T*-3	?	''
*-2	Of	the	almost	3,000	athletes	surveyed	*	,	1,240	took	the	time	0	*	to	respond	*T*-1	.
Here	are	a	few	of	their	answers	:	--	``	They	say	that	I	am	a	student-athlete	,	but	really	I	'm	an	athlete-student	.
They	lied	to	me	on	the	recruiting	trip	.

There	have	been	rumblings	that	,	at	long	last	,	changes	may	be	in	the	works	.
The	Knight	Foundation	,	of	Akron	,	Ohio	,	has	established	a	national	commission	0	*T*-1	to	look	into	college-sports	reform	,	and	the	NCAA	Presidents	Commission	earlier	this	month	recommended	*	cutting	spring	football	practice	in	half	,	moving	the	start	of	basketball	practice	back	by	a	month	and	reducing	maximum	schedules	in	that	sport	to	25	games	from	28	.
The	key	word	in	that	paragraph	,	though	,	is	``	may	.	''
NCAA	Executive	Director	Richard	Schultz	,	in	*	accepting	a	place	on	the	Knight	Commission	,	urged	that	the	panel	take	a	``	balanced	''	view	,	which	*T*-1	looks	for	all	the	world	like	a	plea	0	*T*-3	not	to	rock	the	boat	too	much	,	and	the	presidents	'	recommendations	could	face	considerable	opposition	at	the	NCAA	's	full	convention	in	January	,	which	*T*-2	will	vote	on	them	.
I	read	that	one	unnamed	athletics	director	predicted	that	the	basketball-cutback	proposal	could	fail	because	of	``	real	world	''	-LRB-	i.e.	,	economic	-RRB-	considerations	.
But	the	``	real	world	''	also	includes	the	unpleasant	truth	that	colleges	are	cheating	the	athletes	0	they	have	wooed	and	won	*T*-1	.
If	they	wo	n't	change	their	ways	voluntarily	,	maybe	somebody	bigger	--	Congress	--	should	make	them	*?*	.
They	want	late-night	shuttles	to	the	biology	labs	.
They	want	a	24-hour	library	.
And	like	college	radicals	everywhere	,	they	are	talking	about	a	demonstration	--	where	protesters	would	gather	quietly	near	the	science	building	and	raise	their	hands	,	classroom	style	*T*-1	.
Such	is	the	fiber	of	the	wool	that	woolly	intellectuals	let	fly	*T*-1	at	gatherings	of	Harvard	University	's	new	Society	of	Nerds	and	Geeks	,	or	SONG	.
SONGsters	are	mad	as	heck	about	campus	anti-intellectualism	and	they	are	n't	going	*-1	to	take	it	anymore	,	at	least	not	without	*-2	trying	a	few	really	neat	ideas	first	.
``	We	could	have	called	ourselves	the	Academic	Intellectual	Society	,	but	then	everyone	would	have	said	,	`	Oh	,	you	mean	the	nerd-and-geek	club	,	'	''	Leonid	Fridman	,	SONG	's	graduate-student	adviser	,	told	19	attendees	at	the	club	's	inaugural	meeting	*T*-1	earlier	this	month	.
Membership	has	since	swelled	to	between	20	and	25	.
Some	people	may	think	of	nerds	as	calculator-toting	,	socially	awkward	individuals	with	shirt-pocket	liners	for	their	pencils	and	a	preoccupation	with	computers	and	matters	numerical	.
Geeks	,	by	at	least	one	definition	,	are	chicken-mutilating	circus	freaks	.
But	SONG	founder	Jeremy	Kahn	,	a	Harvard	junior	,	thinks	of	nerds	and	geeks	more	as	``	nonconformists	,	''	albeit	with	a	studious	bent	.
One	of	the	group	's	first	projects	is	a	``	procrastination	hot	line	''	that	students	could	call	*T*-1	when	they	have	an	urge	*	to	delay	*-2	studying	*T*-3	.
The	club	plans	*-1	to	show	nerdy	movies	,	such	as	``	Real	Genius	,	''	in	which	physics	whizzes	pop	corn	with	lasers	*T*-2	;	and	naturally	,	the	``	Revenge	of	the	Nerds	,	''	a	tale	of	college	males	with	runny	noses	and	ill-fitting	pants	.
One	of	its	``	more	ambitious	goals	''	is	*	to	get	Jaime	Escalante	,	the	Los	Angeles	high-school	mathematics	teacher	featured	*	in	the	film	``	*	Stand	and	Deliver	,	''	to	come	to	Harvard	for	a	guest	lecture	.
Nerds	and	geeks	sometimes	find	themselves	a	bit	isolated	at	Harvard	.
So	Mr.	Kahn	says	0	high	priority	is	being	given	*-1	to	*	creating	a	computerized	matchmaking	service	``	where	instead	of	*	being	matched	*-2	for	eye	color	,	you	could	be	matched	*-3	for	similar	intellectual	interests	.	''
For	instance	?
``	I	'm	a	math	major	,	but	I	want	*-1	to	know	about	psychobiology	.
Hopefully	,	I	'd	find	someone	in	psychobiology	who	*T*-1	wanted	*-2	to	know	more	about	mathematics	.	''
It	could	work	.
Meanwhile	,	*	finding	a	volunteer	0	*T*-1	to	write	the	computer	program	is	n't	a	problem	.

CRESTMONT	FEDERAL	SAVINGS	&	LOAN	ASSOCIATION	-LRB-	Edison	,	N.J.	-RRB-	--

He	will	succeed	Charles	L.	Harrington	,	chairman	and	chief	executive	officer	,	who	*T*-1	retired	last	month	.
Crestmont	is	conducting	a	search	for	a	chief	executive	.
Mr.	Seidman	,	a	director	of	Crestmont	since	July	,	is	general	partner	of	Seidman	Financial	Associates	,	which	*T*-1	owns	9.89	%	of	Crestmont	.

Mr.	Russo	,	38	years	old	,	previously	was	first	vice	president	,	public	affairs	and	advertising	,	at	the	banking	unit	.
Environmental	concerns	are	beginning	*-1	to	have	as	much	influence	in	oil-industry	spending	plans	as	the	price	of	crude	does	*?*	.
In	the	wake	of	the	Exxon	Valdez	spill	in	March	,	new	governmental	drilling	bans	are	sharply	curtailing	exploration	in	promising	locations	offshore	and	in	Alaska	.
At	the	same	time	,	moves	toward	tighter	air-quality	standards	are	spurring	interest	in	lighter	or	alternative	fuels	that	*T*-1	do	n't	pollute	as	much	as	fuel	refined	*	from	``	heavy	''	crudes	,	generally	high	in	sulfur	.
Over	the	years	,	the	world	's	stream	of	oil	has	been	growing	heavier	.
So	the	scramble	*ICH*-1	is	on	for	lighter	crudes	globally	,	and	for	natural	gas	in	the	U.S.	.
Recently	Saudi	Arabia	and	Venezuela	,	traditional	heavy-crude	producers	,	have	boasted	of	new	finds	of	light	,	low-sulfur	oil	by	their	national	oil	companies	.
Venezuela	has	also	earmarked	$	200	million	*U*	in	new	money	for	light-crude	exploration	.
And	some	oil	companies	are	trying	*-1	to	lock	in	future	supplies	.
Typical	is	*T*-2	Ente	Nazionale	Idrocarburi	,	Italy	's	state-owned	energy	company	,	which	*T*-1	not	long	ago	acquired	through	its	AGIP	oil	subsidiary	a	5	%	share	in	the	consortium	accounting	for	half	of	Nigeria	's	oil	output	.
AGIP	already	has	an	oil	stake	in	Libya	.
Both	countries	produce	high-quality	,	low-sulfur	crudes	especially	suited	*	to	*	making	high-octane	motor	fuel	at	minimum	refining	cost	.
Franco	Reviglio	,	ENI	chairman	,	looks	for	sweeping	structural	change	in	the	oil	industry	--	he	calls	it	a	``	revolution	''	requiring	huge	investments	--	as	a	result	of	environmental	issues	.
He	made	a	special	trip	*-1	to	examine	U.S.	environmental	trends	because	they	are	often	followed	*-2	in	Europe	.
ENI	needs	*-2	to	know	what	*T*-1	's	coming	as	it	prepares	*-3	to	spend	some	$	1.3	billion	*U*	on	*	upgrading	its	refineries	,	he	says	0	*T*-4	.
Oil	companies	world-wide	will	have	``	*-3	to	spend	a	lot	of	money	for	the	cleaner	fuels	that	*T*-2	will	be	required	*-1	,	''	says	0	*T*-4	John	H.	Lichtblau	,	the	president	of	the	Petroleum	Industry	Research	Foundation	.
It	will	go	for	work	ranging	from	refinery	modification	to	changes	in	the	distribution	system	,	including	the	way	0	service	stations	pump	fuel	into	cars	*T*-1	.
In	the	U.S.	,	the	search	for	oil	had	been	headed	*-1	toward	environmentally	sensitive	areas	believed	*	to	have	vast	reserves	.
Alaska	's	Arctic	National	Wildlife	Refuge	alone	is	thought	*-1	to	hide	more	than	three	billion	barrels	of	oil	.
Until	the	tanker	spill	,	Big	Oil	was	slowly	convincing	authorities	0	it	could	safely	produce	from	such	places	.
Now	the	wildlife	refuge	has	been	closed	*-1	to	the	industry	,	possibly	for	years	.
Similarly	,	a	group	of	companies	led	*	by	Chevron	Corp.	has	been	unable	*-1	to	pump	oil	found	*	off	the	California	coast	in	the	early	1980s	.
A	huge	production	system	built	*	in	the	sea	off	Santa	Barbara	and	ashore	is	sitting	idle	.
But	the	push	for	cleaner	fuels	is	increasing	the	attractiveness	of	natural	gas	.
More	than	half	the	domestic	drilling	now	under	way	is	for	gas	,	partly	on	the	assumption	that	demand	*ICH*-2	will	rise	for	a	fuel	that	*T*-1	is	cleaner	*	to	burn	than	either	oil	or	coal	.
Activity	has	revived	in	the	largest	U.S.	gas-producing	regions	,	such	as	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	.
Santa	Fe	International	Corp.	,	which	*T*-2	is	owned	*-1	by	Kuwait	-LRB-	and	*T*-2	is	n't	related	*-4	to	Santa	Fe	Southern	Pacific	's	unit	-RRB-	,	is	stepping	up	development	of	a	well	off	Texas	'	Matagorda	Island	where	it	found	gas	in	1987	*T*-3	.
``	We	could	have	sat	on	it	longer	,	but	the	impetus	is	*	to	get	the	gas	to	the	marketplace	,	''	says	*T*-1	Richard	Poole	,	senior	scout	for	Santa	Fe	International	.
``	We	're	trying	*-1	to	get	it	on	line	as	soon	as	possible	now	.	''
This	month	,	Exxon	Corp.	announced	plans	for	a	400-day	project	drilling	for	gas	about	five	miles	underground	in	the	Anadarko	Basin	of	western	Oklahoma	--	the	deepest	drilling	project	in	the	U.S.	.
Exxon	will	use	a	Parker	Drilling	Co.	rig	built	*	in	1981	that	*T*-1	can	go	down	9	1\/2	miles	.
As	the	Soviet	Union	grapples	with	its	worsening	economy	,	leading	reformers	have	drawn	up	a	blueprint	for	change	designed	*	to	push	the	nation	much	closer	to	a	free-market	system	.
The	proposals	go	far	beyond	the	current	and	rather	confused	policies	of	perestroika	,	Mikhail	Gorbachev	's	restructuring	of	the	economy	.
They	lay	out	a	clear	timetable	and	methodology	for	*	liberalizing	the	system	of	*	setting	prices	,	breaking	up	huge	industrial	monopolies	and	putting	unprofitable	state-owned	companies	out	of	business	.
They	also	address	such	taboo	subjects	as	the	likelihood	of	unemployment	and	high	inflation	,	and	recommend	ways	0	*	to	soften	the	social	consequences	*T*-1	.
While	many	solutions	to	the	nation	's	economic	troubles	are	being	discussed	*-1	,	the	blueprint	is	attracting	widespread	attention	here	because	of	its	comprehensiveness	and	presumed	high-level	authorship	.
Although	it	was	published	*-1	*-1	unsigned	in	the	latest	edition	of	the	weekly	Ekonomicheskaya	Gazeta	,	Soviet	sources	say	0	the	article	was	written	*-2	by	Leonid	Abalkin	and	a	small	group	of	colleagues	.
Mr.	Abalkin	,	head	of	the	Academy	of	Science	's	Institute	of	Economics	,	was	recently	appointed	*-1	deputy	chairman	of	the	Soviet	government	and	head	of	a	state	commission	on	economic	reform	.
``	It	's	clearly	a	manifesto	for	the	next	stage	of	perestroika	,	''	said	*T*-1	one	analyst	.
The	economic	ideas	in	the	document	are	much	bolder	than	current	policies	.
For	example	,	the	proposed	overhaul	of	prices	--	an	extremely	sensitive	political	topic	--	is	far	more	precise	than	the	vague	plans	announced	*	by	Mr.	Gorbachev	in	1987	and	later	dropped	*	.
But	the	proposals	also	display	political	savvy	,	*	couching	some	of	the	most	controversial	ideas	in	cautious	language	so	as	not	*-3	to	alienate	powerful	conservatives	in	the	government	who	*T*-2	stand	*-4	to	lose	out	if	they	are	implemented	*-1	.
*-3	Seeking	a	middle	path	between	opponents	of	change	and	radicals	who	*T*-1	demand	overnight	solutions	,	the	article	advocates	what	it	calls	*T*-2	a	``	radical-moderate	approach	.	''
The	document	is	*-2	to	be	discussed	*-1	at	a	conference	of	leading	economists	late	this	month	,	and	will	probably	be	presented	*-2	to	the	Soviet	Parliament	for	consideration	this	year	.
As	policy-makers	draw	up	proposals	for	the	next	five-year	plan	,	which	*T*-1	starts	in	1991	,	the	blueprint	represents	a	powerful	first	shot	in	what	*T*-2	is	likely	*-3	to	be	a	fierce	battle	over	economic	reform	.
The	authors	make	a	gloomy	assessment	of	the	economy	and	concede	that	``	quick	and	easy	paths	to	success	simply	do	n't	exist	.	''
Instead	,	they	map	out	a	strategy	in	several	phases	from	now	until	1995	.
Most	of	the	measures	would	probably	only	start	*-1	to	have	an	effect	on	beleaguered	Soviet	consumers	in	two	to	three	years	at	the	earliest	.
The	key	steps	advocated	*	include	:	--	PROPERTY	.
Rigid	ideological	restrictions	on	property	ownership	should	be	abandoned	*-1	.
The	document	proposes	*-1	breaking	up	the	monolithic	system	of	state-owned	enterprises	and	farms	and	allowing	a	big	private	sector	to	flourish	,	*-2	helped	*-3	by	tough	anti-monopoly	legislation	.
The	economy	would	be	thrown	*-2	open	to	numerous	types	of	ownership	*ICH*-3	between	now	and	1992	,	including	factories	leased	*	by	workers	or	owned	*	by	shareholders	,	cooperatives	and	joint	ventures	.
Some	forms	of	private	property	would	be	sanctioned	*-1	.
Such	moves	would	greatly	reduce	the	power	of	government	ministries	,	who	now	*T*-1	jealously	guard	their	turf	and	are	seen	*-2	as	one	of	the	major	obstacles	blocking	economic	reform	.
--	FINANCES	.
Emergency	measures	would	be	introduced	*-1	*-1	to	ease	the	country	's	financial	crisis	,	notably	its	$	200	billion	*U*	budget	deficit	.
By	the	end	of	next	year	,	all	loss-making	state	enterprises	would	be	put	*-2	out	of	business	or	handed	*-2	over	to	workers	who	*T*-1	would	buy	or	lease	them	or	turn	them	into	cooperatives	.
Similar	steps	would	be	taken	*-1	*-1	to	liquidate	unprofitable	state	and	collective	farms	by	the	end	of	1991	.
A	unified	system	of	taxation	should	be	introduced	*-1	rapidly	.
*-2	To	mop	up	some	of	the	300	billion	rubles	in	circulation	,	the	government	should	encourage	home	ownership	,	including	*	issuing	bonds	that	*T*-1	guarantee	holders	the	right	*	to	purchase	an	apartment	.
--	LABOR	.
A	genuine	market	for	labor	and	wages	would	replace	the	present	rigid	,	centralized	system	.
*-1	Departing	from	decades	of	Soviet	dogma	,	the	new	system	would	lead	to	big	differences	in	pay	between	workers	and	almost	certainly	to	unemployment	.
*-1	To	cushion	the	blows	,	the	government	would	introduce	a	minimum	wage	and	unemployment	benefits	.
--	PRICES	.
The	entire	system	of	centrally	set	prices	would	be	overhauled	*-1	,	and	free-market	prices	introduced	for	most	wholesale	trade	and	some	retail	trade	.
Consumers	would	still	be	able	*-2	to	buy	some	food	and	household	goods	at	subsidized	prices	,	but	luxury	and	imported	items	,	including	food	,	would	be	sold	*-1	at	market	prices	.
Wholesale	prices	would	be	divided	*-1	into	three	categories	:	raw	materials	sold	*	at	fixed	prices	close	to	world	levels	;	government-set	procurement	prices	for	a	small	number	of	key	products	;	and	free	prices	for	everything	else	*	to	be	determined	*-2	by	contracts	between	suppliers	and	purchasers	.
Inflation-adjusted	social	benefits	would	ensure	that	the	poor	and	elderly	do	n't	suffer	unduly	.
--	FOREIGN	TRADE	.
The	current	liberalization	and	decentralization	of	foreign	trade	would	be	taken	*-1	much	further	.
Soviet	companies	would	face	fewer	obstacles	for	exports	and	could	even	invest	their	hard	currency	abroad	.
Foreigners	would	receive	greater	incentives	*	to	invest	in	the	U.S.S.R.
Alongside	the	current	non-convertible	ruble	,	a	second	currency	*ICH*-2	would	be	introduced	*-3	that	*T*-1	could	be	freely	exchanged	*-4	for	dollars	and	other	Western	currencies	.
A	domestic	foreign	exchange	market	would	be	set	*-1	up	as	part	of	an	overhaul	of	the	nation	's	banking	system	.
The	blueprint	is	at	its	vaguest	when	*	referring	to	the	fate	of	the	two	powerful	economic	institutions	that	*T*-1	seem	likely	*-2	to	oppose	such	sweeping	plans	:	the	State	Planning	Committee	,	known	*	as	Gosplan	,	and	the	State	Committee	for	Material	Supply	,	or	Gossnab	*T*-3	.
But	it	hints	strongly	that	both	organizations	would	increasingly	lose	their	clout	as	the	changes	,	particularly	the	introduction	of	wholesale	trade	and	the	breakup	of	state	monopolies	,	take	effect	.
*-1	Ready	,	Willing	and	Unable	I	always	lift	the	hood	When	my	car	does	n't	start	*T*-2	;	If	gadgets	at	home	do	n't	work	I	coolly	take	them	apart	.
I	'll	admit	0	there	's	nothing	wrong	That	I	ever	do	find	*T*-1	,	But	it	*EXP*-3	's	nice	when	people	say	0	I	appear	mechanically	inclined	*T*-2	.

--	John	Drybred	.
Albert	Engelken	and	Robert	Thomson	had	never	met	,	though	for	38	years	their	lives	had	been	intertwined	*-1	in	a	way	peculiar	to	the	sports	world	.
Mr.	Engelken	,	now	a	transit-association	executive	in	Washington	,	D.C.	,	and	Mr.	Thomson	,	a	paper-products	salesman	in	Montvale	,	N.J.	,	had	n't	even	talked	to	each	other	.
But	one	recent	day	,	they	became	much	closer	.
Mr.	Engelken	,	a	rabid	baseball	fan	,	pores	over	the	sports	pages	*-1	to	chart	the	exploits	of	``	my	favorite	and	not-so-favorite	teams	and	players	.	''
He	often	groans	,	he	says	0	*T*-3	,	at	the	``	clutter	''	of	sports	stories	about	drugs	,	alcohol	,	gambling	and	some	player	's	lament	``	about	the	miserly	millions	0	he	is	offered	*-1	*T*-2	*-1	to	play	the	game	.	''
His	morning	paper	,	the	Washington	Post	,	even	carries	a	sports	column	called	*	``	Jurisprudence	''	that	*T*-1	recounts	the	latest	arrests	and	convictions	of	players	and	team	managers	.
Like	many	sports	buffs	,	Mr.	Engelken	has	turned	cynic	.
But	his	is	a	story	about	a	hero	in	an	era	of	sports	anti-heroes	,	and	about	what	Babe	Ruth	,	Mr.	Engelken	reminds	us	0	*T*-2	,	once	called	*T*-1	``	the	only	real	game	in	the	world	.	''
To	Mr.	Engelken	,	it	is	also	a	story	``	about	love	,	because	I	'm	blessed	*-2	to	have	a	wife	who	*T*-1	still	thinks	0	her	slightly	eccentric	husband	's	50th	birthday	deserves	the	ultimate	present	.	''
*-4	To	understand	what	Mr.	Engelken	means	*T*-3	,	one	must	go	back	to	a	sunny	October	afternoon	in	1951	at	New	York	's	Polo	Grounds	stadium	,	where	,	it	can	be	argued	*-1	,	the	most	dramatic	moment	in	baseball	history	was	played	*-2	out	*T*-5	.
It	was	the	ninth	inning	of	the	third	game	of	a	three-game	playoff	between	the	Brooklyn	Dodgers	and	the	New	York	Giants	-LRB-	the	predecessor	to	the	San	Francisco	Giants	scheduled	*	to	play	in	tonight	's	world	series	-RRB-	.
Baseball	fans	throughout	New	York	had	sweated	out	a	long	summer	with	their	teams	,	and	now	it	had	come	to	this	:	a	battle	between	the	two	for	the	National	League	pennant	--	down	to	the	last	inning	of	the	last	game	,	no	less	.
Some	34,320	fans	jammed	the	stands	,	and	shouted	at	the	top	of	their	lungs	.
Mr.	Engelken	was	doing	the	same	across	the	Hudson	River	in	New	Jersey	,	where	,	with	his	nose	pressed	*	against	the	front	window	of	the	Passaic-Clifton	National	Bank	,	he	watched	the	duel	on	a	television	set	0	the	bank	set	up	*T*-1	for	the	event	*T*-2	.
The	playoff	series	had	riveted	the	12-year-old	Giants	fan	.
``	The	Giants	struck	first	,	*-1	winning	the	opener	,	3-1	,	on	a	two-run	homer	off	Dodger	right-hander	Ralph	Branca	,	''	Mr.	Engelken	recalls	*T*-2	with	precision	today	.
``	The	Giants	got	swamped	in	the	second	game	,	100	,	and	trailed	4-1	*-1	going	into	the	bottom	of	the	ninth	of	the	third	and	deciding	game	.
The	Giants	scored	once	and	had	runners	*ICH*-1	*ICH*-2	on	second	-LCB-	Whitey	Lockman	-RCB-	and	third	-LCB-	Clint	Hartung	-RCB-	as	Bobby	Thomson	advanced	to	the	plate	.	''
The	rest	,	as	they	say	,	is	history	.
Mr.	Thomson	,	a	tall	,	Scottish-born	,	right-hand	hitter	,	stepped	into	the	batter	's	box	.
``	Thomson	took	a	called	strike	,	''	Mr.	Engelken	recounts	*T*-1	.
The	tension	mounted	as	Ralph	Branca	,	again	on	the	mound	,	stared	down	the	batter	.
He	wound	up	and	let	loose	a	fastball	.
The	pitch	sailed	toward	Bobby	Thomson	high	and	inside	and	then	,	with	a	crack	of	the	bat	,	was	sent	*-1	rocketing	back	into	the	lower	leftfield	stands	.
``	Giants	fans	went	into	euphoria	,	''	says	*T*-1	Mr.	Engelken	.
And	Bobby	Thomson	was	made	*-1	a	legend	.
The	same	Bobby	Thomson	*ICH*-2	,	it	turns	out	,	who	*T*-1	sells	those	paper-goods	today	.
There	ca	n't	be	an	older	baseball	fan	alive	who	*T*-1	does	n't	clearly	remember	that	Bobby	Thomson	homer	,	who	*T*-2	ca	n't	tell	you	where	he	was	when	he	heard	the	famous	Russ	Hodges	radio	broadcast	--	the	one	that	*T*-3	concluded	with	Mr.	Hodges	shouting	,	over	and	over	,	``	The	Giants	win	the	pennant	,	the	Giants	win	the	pennant	*T*-4	*T*-5	!	''
Mr.	Engelken	and	Mr.	Thomson	drifted	in	different	directions	in	the	subsequent	years	,	and	the	Polo	Grounds	,	located	*	under	Coogan	's	Bluff	in	upper	Manhattan	,	was	replaced	*-1	by	a	public-housing	project	.
Mr.	Thomson	played	outfield	and	third	base	until	1960	,	*-1	posting	a	lifetime	.270	batting	average	and	chalking	up	264	home	runs	before	*-2	retiring	and	going	into	paper-goods	sales	.
Mr.	Engelken	moved	south	to	Washington	,	but	he	took	with	him	enduring	memories	of	the	homer	of	1951	.
When	his	wife	,	Betsy	,	came	down	the	aisle	on	their	wedding	day	in	1966	*T*-1	,	Mr.	Engelken	--	no	slouch	on	the	romantic	front	--	gave	her	the	ultimate	compliment	:	``	You	look	prettier	than	Bobby	Thomson	's	home	run	.	''
The	couple	's	first	dog	,	Homer	,	was	named	*-1	after	the	Great	Event	,	though	unwitting	friends	assumed	0	he	was	the	namesake	of	the	poet	.
And	when	Mr.	Engelken	's	sister	,	Martha	,	who	*T*-2	was	born	*-1	two	days	before	the	home	run	,	reached	her	25th	birthday	*T*-4	,	Mr.	Engelken	wrote	his	sports	hero	*-3	to	tell	him	of	the	coincidence	of	events	.
Mr.	Thomson	sent	off	a	card	to	Martha	:	``	It	does	n't	seem	like	25	years	since	I	hit	that	home	run	*-1	to	celebrate	your	birth	,	''	it	read	*T*-2	.
Martha	was	pleased	,	but	nowhere	near	as	much	as	Mr.	Engelken	.
The	family	license	plate	reads	``	ENG	23	,	''	the	first	three	letters	of	the	family	name	and	--	no	surprise	here	--	Bobby	Thomson	's	uniform	number	.
And	on	Mr.	Engelken	's	40th	birthday	,	his	wife	bought	a	book	detailing	the	big	homer	and	sent	it	off	to	Mr.	Thomson	*-2	to	be	autographed	*-1	.
``	What	*T*-1	could	have	been	better	?	''	asks	*T*-2	Mr.	Engelken	.
Betsy	Engelken	asked	the	same	question	earlier	this	year	,	when	her	husband	was	about	to	turn	50	*T*-1	.
She	had	an	idea	.
On	her	husband	's	50th	birthday	-LRB-	after	an	auspicious	23	years	of	marriage	,	it	should	be	noted	*-1	-RRB-	,	Betsy	,	Al	and	their	college-bound	son	set	out	for	New	York	*-2	to	visit	Fordham	University	.
Mrs.	Engelken	had	scheduled	a	stop	on	the	New	Jersey	Turnpike	*-1	to	,	she	told	her	husband	,	pick	up	some	papers	for	a	neighbor	.
The	papers	would	be	handed	*-1	over	at	a	bank	of	telephone	booths	just	off	Exit	10	.
``	It	sounded	like	something	out	of	Ian	Fleming	,	''	Mr.	Engelken	recalls	*T*-1	.
At	the	appointed	exit	,	the	family	pulled	over	,	and	Mrs.	Engelken	went	*-1	to	get	her	papers	.
Mr.	Engelken	turned	off	the	motor	and	rolled	down	the	window	.
In	a	matter	of	minutes	,	she	was	back	,	with	a	tall	,	silver-haired	man	in	tow	.
She	crouched	down	by	the	car	window	and	addressed	her	husband	with	her	favorite	nickname	:
``	Bertie	,	''	she	said	*T*-1	,	``	Happy	50th	Birthday	.
This	is	Bobby	Thomson	.	''
``	And	there	he	was	*-1	,	''	recalls	*T*-2	Mr.	Engelken	.
``	The	hero	of	my	youth	,	the	one	person	in	history	0	I	'd	most	like	*-1	to	meet	*T*-2	.
*	Keep	your	Thomas	Jeffersons	,	or	St.	Augustines	or	Michelangelos	;	I	'd	take	baseball	's	Flying	Scot	without	hesitation	.	''
They	talked	of	the	home	run	.
``	I	thought	0	it	was	in	the	upper	deck	,	''	said	*T*-1	Bobby	Thomson	,	now	66	years	old	.
They	talked	of	the	aftermath	.
``	I	never	thought	0	it	would	become	so	momentous	,	''	Bobby	remarked	*T*-1	.
Mr.	Engelken	,	says	0	*T*-1	his	wife	,	``	was	overwhelmed	*-2	by	the	whole	thing	.
It	was	worth	it	,	just	for	the	look	on	Albert	's	face	.	''
The	two	men	spent	an	hour	at	Exit	10	,	*-1	rehashing	the	event	,	``	*-1	fulfilling	the	lifelong	dream	of	a	young	boy	now	turned	*	50	,	''	Mr.	Engelken	says	*T*-2	.
His	hero	signed	photographs	of	the	homer	and	diplomatically	called	Ralph	Branca	``	a	very	fine	pitcher	.	''
And	when	Mr.	Engelken	asked	him	why	he	took	time	*ICH*-1	*ICH*-2	off	from	work	for	somebody	0	he	did	n't	even	know	*T*-4	*T*-5	*T*-6	,	Bobby	Thomson	replied	:	``	You	know	,	Albert	,	0	if	you	have	the	chance	*ICH*-3	in	life	*	to	make	somebody	this	happy	,	you	have	an	obligation	*	to	do	it	.	''
In	an	interview	,	Mr.	Thomson	,	who	*T*-1	is	married	*-2	and	has	three	grown	children	,	says	0	he	has	few	ties	to	baseball	*ICH*-3	these	days	,	other	than	*	playing	old-timers	games	now	and	again	.
But	his	fans	,	to	his	constant	amazement	,	never	let	him	forget	the	famous	four-bagger	.
His	mail	regularly	recalls	``	my	one	event	,	''	and	has	been	growing	in	recent	years	.
In	response	to	the	letters	,	Mr.	Thomson	usually	sends	an	autographed	photo	with	a	polite	note	,	and	rarely	arranges	a	rendezvous	.
But	when	Betsy	Engelken	wrote	him	,	*-1	saying	0	she	could	stop	near	his	New	Jersey	home	*T*-2	,	it	seemed	different	.
``	What	a	good	feeling	it	*EXP*-3	would	be	*T*-2	for	me	to	do	that	,	''	he	says	0	he	thought	*T*-4	.
When	the	Engelken	family	got	back	from	its	trip	up	north	*T*-3	,	Mr.	Engelken	wrote	it	all	down	,	*-2	just	to	make	sure	0	no	detail	was	missed	*-1	.
``	On	the	way	home	,	''	his	notes	recall	*T*-1	,	``	it	took	concentrated	effort	*	to	keep	that	car	pointed	*	south	.
My	mind	was	miles	north	at	a	place	called	*	Coogan	's	Bluff	,	where	a	real	sports	hero	had	captured	the	imagination	of	a	kid	who	*T*-1	never	fully	grew	up	and	is	all	the	richer	for	it	*T*-2	.
``	*	Take	heart	,	sports	fans	,	''	he	wrote	*T*-1	.
``	Real	heroes	exist	.
You	might	not	find	one	in	the	`	Jurisprudence	'	column	.
But	who	*T*-1	knows	?
You	might	meet	up	with	him	at	that	bank	of	telephone	booths	just	off	Exit	10	of	the	New	Jersey	Turnpike	.
Southam	Inc.	said	0	its	unprofitable	weekly	newspaper	,	The	Financial	Times	of	Canada	,	is	up	for	sale	.
Analysts	said	0	the	announcement	,	the	latest	in	a	series	of	divestitures	and	restructuring	moves	,	is	aimed	*-1	at	*	improving	Southam	's	earnings	before	the	expiration	*ICH*-2	in	June	of	a	standstill	pact	with	Torstar	Corp	.
When	that	agreement	expires	*T*-1	,	Torstar	will	be	free	*-2	to	increase	its	22.4	%	stake	in	Southam	,	or	*-2	to	make	an	offer	for	the	whole	company	.
Descendants	of	the	Southam	family	hold	an	additional	22.6	%	stake	in	the	Toronto-based	company	,	Canada	's	largest	newspaper	publisher	.
The	newspaper	could	fetch	between	15	million	and	20	million	Canadian	dollars	-LRB-	US$	12.8	million	to	$	17.1	million	*U*	-RRB-	,	said	0	*T*-2	one	analyst	,	who	*T*-1	asked	not	*-3	to	be	identified	*-4	.
A	spokesman	for	Southam	declined	*-3	to	comment	on	the	price	0	the	company	is	seeking	*T*-2	or	on	estimates	of	the	paper	's	annual	losses	,	which	most	analysts	place	*T*-1	at	between	C$	4	million	and	C$	7	million	*U*	.
Yesterday	,	Southam	reported	third-quarter	earnings	of	C$	10.8	million	*U*	on	revenue	of	C$	395.4	million	*U*	,	down	from	C$	14.6	million	*U*	on	revenue	of	C$	389.6	million	*U*	in	the	year-ago	quarter	.
``	*-1	To	be	profitable	,	the	paper	requires	more	circulation	and	building	circulation	is	an	expensive	undertaking	,	''	said	*T*-2	John	Macfarlane	,	the	paper	's	publisher	.
Southam	said	0	the	level	of	future	investment	required	*	by	the	paper	would	have	restricted	its	options	in	other	areas	.
The	acquisition	of	the	Financial	Times	of	Canada	is	``	well	within	reach	for	any	number	of	media	companies	,	both	public	and	private	,	''	said	*T*-1	James	Cole	,	an	analyst	with	Toronto-based	BBN	James	Capel	Inc	.
Possible	bidders	include	Christopher	Ondaatje	,	a	Toronto	financier	and	vice	chairman	of	Hees	International	Bancorp	Inc.	,	a	holding	company	controlled	*	by	Toronto	's	Bronfman	family	.
Mr.	Ondaatje	sold	his	stake	in	Pagurian	Corp.	to	Hees	earlier	this	year	and	is	said	*-1	to	be	seeking	a	media	acquisition	.
Mr.	Ondaatje	could	n't	be	reached	*-1	for	comment	,	but	Roy	Mac-Laren	,	chairman	of	CB	Media	,	a	closely	held	concern	that	*T*-2	publishes	two	business	magazines	,	said	0	his	company	would	take	a	close	look	at	the	newspaper	.
Mr.	Cole	said	0	the	sale	of	the	77-year	Financial	Times	,	which	Southam	has	owned	*T*-1	since	1961	,	is	consistent	with	Southam	's	strategy	of	*	cutting	costs	*-2	to	obtain	maximum	profits	from	its	operations	while	*-3	disposing	of	``	chronically	under-performing	''	assets	.
Southam	agreed	*-1	to	sell	its	47	%	stake	in	Selkirk	Communications	Ltd.	,	a	broadcasting	concern	,	to	Maclean	Hunter	Ltd.	for	about	C$	285	million	*U*	last	year	.
This	year	,	it	has	moved	*-1	to	cut	costs	in	its	newspaper	division	through	layoffs	and	asset	sales	,	while	*-2	reaching	joint	venture	and	acquisition	agreements	in	other	areas	.
The	Financial	Times	of	Canada	has	no	links	to	the	British	daily	newspaper	,	The	Financial	Times	.
Norton	Co.	said	0	net	income	for	the	third	quarter	fell	6	%	to	$	20.6	million	*U*	,	or	98	cents	a	share	,	from	$	22	million	*U*	,	or	$	1.03	*U*	a	share	.
Operating	profit	for	the	abrasives	,	engineering	materials	and	petroleum	services	concern	was	$	19.2	million	*U*	,	or	91	cents	a	share	,	up	3	%	from	$	18.7	million	*U*	,	or	87	cents	a	share	.
The	company	had	a	tax	credit	of	$	1.4	million	*U*	.
In	the	year-earlier	quarter	,	the	tax	credit	was	$	3.3	million	*U*	.
Sales	rose	8	%	to	$	368.5	million	*U*	from	$	340.7	million	*U*	.
Operating	profit	in	the	company	's	abrasives	segment	rose	16	%	while	operating	profit	in	the	engineering	materials	segment	rose	2	%	.
However	,	the	company	's	petroleum	services	segment	,	while	profitable	,	was	hurt	*-1	by	high	financing	costs	associated	*	with	the	company	's	buy-out	of	a	50	%	stake	in	Eastman	Christensen	Co.	from	Texas	Eastern	Corp.	last	June	.
Norton	and	Texas	Eastern	had	each	held	a	50	%	stake	in	Eastman	in	a	joint	venture	.
Norton	announced	earlier	this	month	that	it	was	exploring	the	possible	sale	of	all	or	part	of	Eastman	Christensen	.
For	the	nine	months	,	Norton	had	net	of	$	81.2	million	*U*	,	or	$	3.87	*U*	a	share	,	and	a	tax	credit	of	$	4.4	million	*U*	.
In	the	year-earlier	period	,	the	company	had	net	of	$	77.2	million	*U*	,	or	$	3.68	*U*	a	share	,	and	a	tax	credit	of	$	7.7	million	*U*	.
Norton	had	operating	profit	of	$	76.8	million	*U*	,	or	$	3.66	*U*	a	share	,	up	11	%	from	$	69.5	million	*U*	,	or	$	3.31	*U*	a	share	.
Sales	rose	8	%	to	$	1.15	billion	*U*	from	$	1.06	billion	*U*	.
Y.J.	Park	and	her	family	scrimped	for	four	years	*-2	to	buy	a	tiny	apartment	here	,	but	found	that	the	closer	they	got	*-3	to	saving	the	$	40,000	*U*	0	they	originally	needed	*T*-1	,	the	more	the	price	rose	.
By	this	month	,	it	had	more	than	doubled	.
Now	the	33-year-old	housewife	,	whose	husband	*T*-1	earns	a	modest	salary	as	an	assistant	professor	of	economics	,	is	saving	harder	than	ever	.
``	I	am	determined	*-1	to	get	an	apartment	in	three	years	,	''	she	says	*T*-2	.
``	It	's	all	0	I	think	about	*T*-1	or	talk	about	*T*-1	.	''
For	the	Parks	and	millions	of	other	young	Koreans	,	the	long-cherished	dream	of	home	ownership	has	become	a	cruel	illusion	.
For	the	government	,	it	has	become	a	highly	volatile	political	issue	.
Last	May	,	a	government	panel	released	a	report	on	the	extent	and	causes	of	the	problem	.
During	the	past	15	years	,	the	report	showed	0	*T*-1	,	housing	prices	increased	nearly	fivefold	.
The	report	laid	the	blame	on	speculators	,	who	it	said	0	*T*-1	had	pushed	land	prices	up	ninefold	.
The	panel	found	that	since	1987	,	real-estate	prices	rose	nearly	50	%	in	a	speculative	fever	fueled	*	by	economic	prosperity	,	the	1988	Seoul	Olympics	and	the	government	's	pledge	*	to	rapidly	develop	Korea	's	southwest	.
The	result	is	that	those	rich	enough	*	to	own	any	real	estate	at	all	have	boosted	their	holdings	substantially	.
For	those	with	no	holdings	,	the	prospects	of	*	buying	a	home	are	ever	slimmer	.
In	1987	,	a	quarter	of	the	population	owned	91	%	of	the	nation	's	71,895	square	kilometers	of	private	land	,	the	report	said	0	*T*-1	,	and	10	%	of	the	population	owned	65	%	of	the	land	devoted	*	to	housing	.
Meanwhile	,	the	government	's	Land	Bureau	reports	that	only	about	a	third	of	Korean	families	own	their	own	homes	.
Rents	have	soared	along	with	house	prices	.
Former	National	Assemblyman	Hong	Sa-Duk	,	now	a	radio	commentator	,	says	0	the	problem	is	intolerable	for	many	people	.
``	I	'm	afraid	of	a	popular	revolt	if	this	situation	is	n't	corrected	,	''	he	adds	*T*-1	.
In	fact	,	during	the	past	three	months	there	have	been	several	demonstrations	at	the	office	complex	where	the	Land	Bureau	is	housed	*-1	*T*-2	,	and	at	the	National	Assembly	,	demanding	0	the	government	put	a	stop	to	real-estate	speculation	.
President	Roh	Tae	Woo	's	administration	has	been	studying	the	real-estate	crisis	for	the	past	year	with	an	eye	to	partial	land	redistribution	.
Last	week	,	the	government	took	three	bills	to	the	National	Assembly	.
The	proposed	legislation	is	aimed	*-1	at	*	rectifying	some	of	the	inequities	in	the	current	land-ownership	system	.
Highlights	of	the	bills	,	as	*	currently	framed	*-2	,	are	:	--	A	restriction	on	the	amount	of	real	estate	0	one	family	can	own	*T*-1	,	to	660	square	meters	in	the	nation	's	six	largest	cities	,	but	more	in	smaller	cities	and	rural	areas	.
The	government	will	penalize	offenders	,	but	wo	n't	confiscate	property	.
--	A	tax	of	between	3	%	and	6	%	*U*	on	property	holdings	that	*T*-1	exceed	the	governmentset	ceiling	.
--	Taxes	of	between	15	%	and	50	%	*U*	a	year	on	``	excessive	''	profits	from	the	resale	of	property	,	or	the	sale	of	idle	land	to	the	government	.
The	government	defines	excessive	profits	as	those	above	the	average	realized	*	for	other	similar-sized	properties	in	an	area	.
--	Grace	periods	ranging	from	two	to	five	years	before	the	full	scope	of	the	penalties	takes	effect	.
The	administration	says	0	the	measures	would	stem	rampant	property	speculation	,	free	more	land	for	the	government	's	ambitious	housing-construction	program	,	designed	*	to	build	two	million	apartments	by	1992	--	and	,	perhaps	,	boost	the	popular	standing	of	President	Roh	.
But	opposition	legislators	and	others	calling	for	help	for	South	Korea	's	renters	say	0	the	proposed	changes	do	n't	go	far	enough	*-2	to	make	it	*EXP*-1	possible	for	ordinary	people	to	buy	a	home	.
Some	want	lower	limits	on	house	sizes	;	others	insist	on	progressively	higher	taxation	for	larger	homes	and	lots	.
The	Citizens	Coalition	for	Economic	Justice	,	a	public-interest	group	leading	the	charge	for	radical	reform	,	wants	restrictions	on	landholdings	,	high	taxation	of	capital	gains	,	and	drastic	revamping	of	the	value-assessment	system	on	which	property	taxes	are	based	*-1	*T*-2	.
But	others	,	large	landowners	,	real-estate	developers	and	business	leaders	,	say	0	the	government	's	proposals	are	intolerable	.
*-1	Led	*-2	by	the	Federation	of	Korean	Industries	,	the	critics	are	lobbying	for	the	government	to	weaken	its	proposed	restrictions	and	penalties	.
Government	officials	who	*T*-1	are	urging	real-estate	reforms	balk	at	the	arguments	of	business	leaders	and	chafe	at	their	pressure	.
``	There	is	no	violation	of	the	capitalistic	principle	of	private	property	in	what	we	are	doing	*T*-2	,	''	says	*T*-3	Lee	Kyu	Hwang	,	director	of	the	government	's	Land	Bureau	,	which	*T*-1	drafted	the	bills	.
But	,	he	adds	0	*T*-1	,	the	constitution	empowers	the	government	to	impose	some	controls	,	*-2	to	mitigate	the	shortage	of	land	.
The	land	available	for	housing	construction	stands	at	about	46.2	square	meters	a	person	--	18	%	lower	than	in	Taiwan	and	only	about	half	that	of	Japan	.
Mr.	Lee	estimates	that	about	10,000	property	speculators	are	operating	in	South	Korea	.
The	chief	culprits	,	he	says	0	*T*-2	,	are	big	companies	and	business	groups	that	*T*-1	buy	huge	amounts	of	land	``	not	for	their	corporate	use	,	but	for	resale	at	huge	profit	.	''
One	research	institute	calculated	that	as	much	as	67	%	of	corporate-owned	land	is	held	*-1	by	403	companies	--	and	that	as	little	as	1.5	%	of	that	is	used	*-2	for	business	.
The	government	's	Office	of	Bank	Supervision	and	Examination	told	the	National	Assembly	this	month	that	in	the	first	half	of	1989	,	the	nation	's	30	largest	business	groups	bought	real	estate	valued	*	at	$	1.5	billion	*U*	.
The	Ministry	of	Finance	,	as	a	result	,	has	proposed	a	series	of	measures	that	*T*-1	would	restrict	business	investment	in	real	estate	even	more	tightly	than	restrictions	aimed	*	at	individuals	.
Under	those	measures	,	financial	institutions	would	be	restricted	*-1	from	*-1	owning	any	more	real	estate	than	they	need	for	their	business	operations	.
Banks	,	investment	and	credit	firms	would	be	permitted	*-1	to	own	land	equivalent	in	value	to	50	%	of	their	capital	--	currently	the	proportion	is	75	%	.
The	maximum	allowable	property	holdings	for	insurance	companies	would	be	reduced	*-1	to	10	%	of	their	total	asset	value	,	down	from	15	%	currently	.
But	Mrs.	Park	acknowledges	that	even	if	the	policies	work	*-1	to	slow	or	stop	speculation	,	apartment	prices	are	unlikely	*-2	to	go	down	.
